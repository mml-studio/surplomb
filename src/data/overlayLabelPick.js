/**
 * The name on the globe is a click surface, not a caption.
 *
 * Every layer here draws two things per record: a native Cesium primitive (a
 * point, a billboard, a clamped stroke) and — for the few records that win a
 * collision slot — an ambient label carrying the record's NAME, painted by the
 * shared world overlay a dozen pixels above it. Only the first of those was
 * ever clickable. The label is the part that says what the object *is*, it is
 * five to twenty times the target area of the dot it belongs to, and it reads
 * like a button, so it was the part people aimed at — and every one of those
 * clicks landed on empty terrain and DISMISSED the selection instead.
 *
 * The reason is mechanical, not a policy: the overlay paints onto a
 * `pointer-events: none` canvas stacked over the Cesium viewport, so
 * `scene.pick()` under a label returns whatever is behind it (usually the
 * globe, i.e. nothing). The host already publishes a screen-space hit
 * rectangle for every entry flagged `interactive`, and
 * `hitTestWorldOverlay()` already resolves the topmost one. What was missing
 * was the two lines in each layer's click handler that consult it, and this
 * module is those two lines written once.
 *
 * ── The ordering rule ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * A layer's LEFT_CLICK handler must resolve in this order, and the order is
 * not cosmetic:
 *
 *   1. `scene.pick()` — a native primitive under the cursor wins. Labels float
 *      ABOVE their anchor, so a dot and a label rarely overlap; when they do,
 *      the thing the depth buffer says you are pointing at is the honest
 *      answer, and it is also the one the pick registry can arbitrate between
 *      layers.
 *   2. this module — the label plane, which the depth buffer knows nothing
 *      about.
 *   3. only then, empty space → clear the selection.
 *
 * Putting the label test first would let a label drawn over a NEIGHBOURING
 * station's dot steal that station's click.
 *
 * ── Why `has` is not optional in practice ───────────────────────────────────
 * Hit rectangles are published per painted frame and pooled, so a rect for a
 * record that has since left the viewport can outlive the record by a frame.
 * Resolving that id against the layer's live record map is what keeps a click
 * from selecting a station that is no longer on screen — and a miss there is
 * NOT the same as empty space, so callers get `null` and fall through to their
 * own "nothing here" branch exactly once.
 *
 * ── The id convention ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Ambient labels are published under `<layer>-label:<recordId>` (powerGrid,
 * gasFrance, rteGeneration, frHydroPlants, roadEventsFrance) or under the bare
 * record id (hubeauHydrometry, satellites, telegeographySubmarineCables).
 * `prefix` spans both: pass the prefix the layer uses, or `''` when the entry
 * id IS the record id.
 *
 * ── Detection callouts ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The DETECT overlay is not an entry source: it solves its own placement and
 * paints through a host lane, so its callsigns publish their hit rectangles
 * directly (`publishWorldOverlayLaneRect`) under a source id of their own —
 * {@link detectionLabelSourceId}, one per contributing layer, with the record
 * id bare. Per-layer is the load-bearing part: aircraft and military share the
 * lane, and a click handler that hit-tested the lane as a whole would resolve
 * its neighbour's callsign as its own.
