/**
 * lazyVoice.js — the voice agent costs nothing until someone reaches for it.
 *
 * ── WHY ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Measured on rollup's own module graph (2026-09-09, after the layers moved
 * out in #123): the static closure of `src/main.js` was 2 708 kB before
 * minification, and **360 kB of it was reachable only through the voice
 * stack** — the realtime controller (129 kB), the annotation engine and its
 * two renderers (105 kB), the scene director and its recipes (65 kB), the
 * brain-voice session (40 kB), the cost meter (17 kB). None of it is needed to
 * open a map, and most visitors never press the mic.
 *
 * ── WHEN IT LOADS ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Two triggers, whichever comes first:
 *
 *   - **Browser idle**, bounded (`whenIdle`). The point of this file is not to
 *     make voice rare, it is to keep it out of the way of the globe: once the
 *     boot burst has drained, the module lands on its own and everything that
 *     reads `window.__gevVoiceCommands` — eight QA harnesses among them — finds
 *     what it expects without asking for it.
 *   - **Intent**, immediately: a pointer on the panel, keyboard focus on the
 *     mic, or the push-to-talk key. In practice idle wins by several seconds;
 *     this is the path for someone who clicks the mic during the fly-in.
 *
 * ── WHY THE PANEL IS NOT LAZY, ONLY ITS BRAIN ───────────────────────────────
 *
 * The mic panel is part of the cockpit. A control that materialises a second
 * after everything else reads as a page still loading, and it would move the
 * command dock under the cursor. So the shell is built at boot from
 * `voiceControlDom.js` — markup and nothing else — and the controller rebuilds
 * the same markup when it arrives (`createVoiceControl({ reset: true })`).
 * That rebuild is why the listeners installed here need no removal: they die
 * with the node they were attached to. The one on `window` does not, and is
 * removed by hand.
 *
 * @module voice/lazyVoice
