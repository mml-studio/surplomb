/**
 * Filosofi at territory level — what the carroyage cannot say from far away.
 *
 * WHY THIS MODULE EXISTS. The carroyage is 2.3 million squares and the layer
 * refuses to draw them above a 0.9° box, because a national view of them would
 * be a SAMPLE of the country wearing the clothes of a picture of it. That
 * refusal is correct and it left the map blank at exactly the altitude an
 * operator opens the app at. INSEE publishes the same family of indicators
 * already aggregated — commune, EPCI, département, région — through a second,
 * keyless API, and this module reads it so the layer has something true to draw
 * when the grid has nothing.
 *
 * IT IS A DIFFERENT DATASET, NOT THE SAME ONE FROM FURTHER AWAY, and every
 * label here exists to stop that confusion:
 *
 *   - The carroyage's `niveau` is a **mean** over a cell's inhabitants. This
 *     one's is the **median** over a département's. Averaging and halving are
 *     not the same statistic and the chip is renamed when the layer crosses
 *     between them.
 *   - The carroyage's `pauvrete` is the share of **households** under the
 *     threshold. `PR_MD60` is the share of **people**. Same word, two
 *     denominators.
 *   - The millésimes differ: the relayed carroyage is 2019, these figures are
 *     2023, and the wage series is 2024. A card that showed one number without
 *     its year would be inviting a comparison that does not hold.
 *
 * WHAT INSEE ACTUALLY GIVES, measured 2026-09-03 against the live API:
 * `DS_FILOSOFI_CC` answers 27 measures per territory over *France
 * métropolitaine et La Réunion* — no Guadeloupe, Martinique, Guyane or Mayotte,
 * which is a NARROWER scope than the carroyage's (that one has Martinique). It
 * carries no denominator, so the population comes from
 * `DS_POPULATIONS_REFERENCE` and the wage from `DS_BTS_SAL_EQTP_SEX_AGE`.
