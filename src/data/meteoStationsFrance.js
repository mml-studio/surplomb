/**
 * Stations météo (FR) — the French stations whose readings are public, and what
 * each instrument can actually tell you.
 *
 * This layer exists because the globe already showed the weather three times —
 * Open-Meteo's conditions in the cockpit, Météo-France's vigilance colours per
 * département, Vigicrues on the rivers — and never once showed **where the
 * numbers come from**. A vigilance map is an interpretation of readings taken
 * somewhere; this is the somewhere.
 *
 * ── What is drawn: 190 stations out of 2 144 ────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Météo-France's real-time network is **2 144 stations**. **190 of them publish
 * their observations in the open. The other 1 954 are measuring right now and
 * their readings sit behind a Météo-France API key.** This layer draws the 190.
 *
 * It used to draw all 2 144, with a chip to filter down to the ones that
 * publish, and that was the wrong default: nine markers in ten answered a click
 * with an explanation of why they had nothing to say. A dot on a map is a
 * promise that clicking it tells you something, so the gate belongs at the data
 * and not at the card. `SHOW_ONLY_PUBLISHING` is that gate and it is one
 * boolean: the shipped pack still carries the whole network, so a deployment
 * that holds a key flips it back and draws all 2 144 without a rebuild. The
 * Météo-France API access note (#195) is the contract that would make that
 * worth doing.
 *
 * `getStats()` reports the 1 954 it withholds, every time. Hiding stations is a
 * display choice; pretending the network is 190 stations would be a lie about
 * France.
 *
 * ── How old the readings are, which is the question this layer must answer ──
 *
 * The keyless observation product is the SYNOP yearly archive, and it is **not
 * hourly**: three-hourly observations, consolidated once each morning around
 * 07:00 UTC, carrying through the previous evening. So a card opened today
 * shows a reading **11 to 35 hours old**, and it prints that reading's own
 * timestamp rather than the word "now". Nothing in this project can improve on
 * that figure — only a key can. Measured 2026-09-14; see trap 6 in
 * `meteoStationsFrFeed.js`, which is also where the five-day-stale mirror this
 * module read until that date is written down.
 *
 * ── What a marker means, and why they are not all the same colour ───────────
 *
 * Colour is capability — what the instrument can answer — and size is the
 * number of instrument families it carries, one to fourteen. Across the whole
 * network that split is dramatic: **1 254 of the 2 144 measure temperature and
 * rain and nothing else**, and only 845 can say which way the wind is blowing.
 * Across the 190 drawn here it is nearly uniform — **182 are synoptic, 189 have
 * an anemometer, 187 a barometer** — which is the same fact read from the other
 * end: the stations France publishes are the complete ones. The palette stays
 * because the eight exceptions are real and a reader is entitled to see them
 * before clicking, and the card names every family in words, because colour
 * alone must never carry the meaning.
 *
 * ── Honesty rules this layer is built around ────────────────────────────────
 *
 * • **The 1 954 withheld stations are named in `getStats()`, never drawn.** The
 *   card for a station that does not publish is still written and still says
 *   "API Météo-France sur clé" rather than "no data" — it is reachable the
 *   moment the gate is flipped, and the two sentences are different facts.
 *
 * • **Seven stations in the real-time list are closed and six have no published
 *   inventory.** MARSILLARGUES since 2026-01-01, ALBA LA ROMAINE in no metadata
 *   file at all. None of the thirteen publishes, so none of them is drawn under
 *   the gate — the hollow disc and the neutral grey that say so are dormant, not
 *   deleted, for exactly the same reason the withheld stations stay in the pack.
 *
 * • **This is the real-time network, not the register.** France has 14 751
 *   climatological postes back to 1806, of which 2 404 are open, plus 699
 *   *stations complémentaires* run by the DGPR, the DIR routes, the DREAL and
 *   EDF. None of them is drawn here. `getStats()` reports what is excluded.
 *
 * • **RADOME is the publisher's word, not a quality score.** 696 stations are
 *   in the reference network expertised at J+1 and 1 448 are not. The card says
 *   which; the layer does not rank them.
 *
 * The network is a shipped file — `local_data/meteo_stations_fr/stations.json`,
 * rebuilt with `npm run meteo:stations` — because the instrument inventory it
 * encodes lives in a 191 MB file no browser can fetch. See that script's header.
