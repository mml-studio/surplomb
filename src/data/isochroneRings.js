/**
 * Zone de chalandise — the ground you can actually reach, instead of a circle.
 *
 * WHY THIS LAYER EXISTS, AND WHY IT DID NOT UNTIL NOW. The `/api/isochrone`
 * proxy has been in this repository since 2026-09-01 and nothing has ever drawn
 * it: a service with no surface. The whole point of an isochrone is that it is
 * the one thing a circle cannot say — a circle at 800 m crosses railways,
 * rivers and motorways as if they were pavement, and the Géoplateforme runs
 * Valhalla over IGN's own BD TOPO network and answers the polygon actually
 * reachable. Measured over the Lyon Presqu'île on 2026-09-02: five minutes on
 * foot is 0.28 km², ten is 0.94, fifteen is 2.16.
 *
 * THE CYCLING RING COMES FROM SOMEWHERE ELSE, AND IT IS DRAWN DIFFERENTLY. IGN
 * has no cycling cost model at any resource — re-probed 2026-09-02, still
 * `value should be one of car,pedestrian` — so a cycling ring is measured on
 * the OSM cycling network through the FOSSGIS OSRM table, along 36 spokes. It
 * is an ENVELOPE, not a polygon: every vertex is a real routed duration, and
 * the straight line between two neighbouring vertices is not. It is therefore
 * drawn with a DASHED outline and its area is called a majorant rather than a
 * surface. `isochroneFeed.js` carries the measured divergence — up to +69 % of
 * area in sparse rural networks — and the card prints it.
 *
 * WHY THE CEILING IS PER MODE, AND WHY A PIN HAS NONE. A fifteen-minute walk is
 * 1.9 km across and a fifteen-minute drive is up to 16.5 km (measured over five
 * French communes on 2026-09-02, rural Cantal being the widest). One ceiling
 * for both meant the driving catchment the layer had just measured was cleared
 * off the screen the moment the reader pulled back far enough to see it — the
 * layer refusing to show its own answer. So the ceiling now follows the mode.
 * And a reader who clicks the map PINS the centre, which removes the ceiling
 * altogether: the ceiling exists to stop a camera-driven layer from firing a
 * request per nudge across a country, and a pinned centre fires nothing when
 * the camera moves.
 *
 * THE NUMBER THAT IS NOT ON ANY COMPETITOR'S MAP. In open ground a reachable
 * area grows with the SQUARE of time, so doubling the budget quadruples the
 * area. Every shortfall is the network — a river with one bridge, a railway, a
 * cul-de-sac. `ringExpansion()` reports the measured growth against that 4×,
 * per consecutive pair, and it needs no assumed walking speed and no model: it
 * is two measured areas divided by each other. A share of 84 % between 5 and
 * 10 minutes is a place fraying at its edges; a share above 100 % is a place
 * that opens up once you clear the first block.
 *
 * A CLICK NOW ALSO MOVES THE CAMERA, AND THE CARD OPENS ITSELF. Measuring the
 * ground a point reaches and then leaving it half under a panel, at whatever
 * altitude the reader happened to be at, is the layer refusing to show its own
 * answer in a second way. So a pinned centre is FRAMED: the catchment is fitted
 * to the part of the canvas the chrome is not sitting on, top-down, with a band
 * reserved at the bottom for the card — and the card is anchored on the shape's
 * lower edge rather than on its centre, so it is beside the wash instead of on
 * top of it. `isochroneFraming.js` holds that arithmetic and the reasons.
 *
 * AND THE CARD IS TITLED WITH THE ADDRESS. "Point fixé — à pied" named the
 * layer's internal state and not the reader's subject; the proxy reverse-
 * geocodes the pin through the BAN and the card is titled with the street, the
 * commune when the nearest address is too far to be the one clicked, and the
 * coordinate when there is neither.
 *
 * WHY THE FILLS STACK. The three rings are nested, drawn far to near, each at a
 * low alpha, so the centre is the sum of three and the outer band is one. That
 * gradient IS the reachability, and it is deliberate rather than an accident of
 * overlap. Each ring carries a DISTINCT colour, which also keeps Cesium from
 * batching two of them into one ground-classification primitive — a batch
 * colours its instances by bounding rectangle, and three concentric rings share
 * a rectangle almost exactly.
