/**
 * @module fraicheurFeed
 *
 * Where Paris keeps its cool — the three registers the Ville de Paris
 * publishes about heat, and the arithmetic that decides what each one is
 * allowed to claim.
 *
 * `fraicheurTrees.js` holds the 219 432-tree half, which is a different
 * problem and gets a different regime; `fraicheurParis.js` is the drawing.
 * Everything here is pure and node-testable, under test against real captured
 * rows.
 *
 * ── The layer's argument, in one paragraph ─────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Paris publishes two lists that both sound like "where to cool off" and are
 * not the same list. `ilots-de-fraicheur-equipements-activites` is 535 POINTS
 * and it is mostly things that never close — 127 permanent shade canopies, 125
 * places of worship, 87 misters — while only **112 of the 535** publish a
 * weekday timetable a machine can read. `ilots-de-fraicheur-espaces-verts-frais`
 * is 984 real FOOTPRINTS and is the opposite: **715 of the 984** publish one.
 * So the clock lives on the parks, not on the equipment, which is the reverse
 * of what the two dataset titles suggest.
 *
 * And the clock is dated. **682 of the 984 green spaces attach their opening
 * hours to a validity window that had already expired on 2026-09-01** — 638 of
 * them to the same one, `du 01/05/26 au 31/08/26`, which ended the day before
 * this file was measured. Only 25 were still inside their stated window. Every
 * card built here says which window its hours came from and whether that window
 * is over, because a timetable presented without its expiry date is the single
 * misreading this layer would otherwise invite.
 *
 * The asymmetry underneath: **23 of the 984 carry `canicule_ouverture = "Oui"`**
 * — a declared heatwave arrangement — and **11 of those 23 have
 * `indice_veget_sup8m_2024 = 0`**, no measured canopy over 8 m at all. Their
 * median canopy share is 0.0280 against 0.3197 across all 983 spaces that carry
 * the metric. Eight of the eleven are planters (`JARDINIÈRES`) around the Porte
 * Maillot roundabout. Paris's heatwave list is, in the majority, traffic
 * islands with nothing to close.
 *
 * ── Why the whole city ships in one document ───────────────────────────────
 *
 * Measured 2026-09-01, upstream, through the exact `exports/geojson` URLs the
 * proxy builds: équipements 45 165 B on the wire / 290 718 B decoded, espaces
 * verts 3 555 863 / 9 216 103, fontaines 61 794 / 422 828 — **3 662 822 B on
 * the wire for the three**. Projected by this module the same content is
 * 3 449 847 B of JSON and **643 100 B gzipped**, which is about what the whole
 * `sup-fr` national register costs (0.62 MB gzipped) for a city of 105 km². So there
 * is no bbox query on this half and no spatial thinning: the browser is handed
 * Paris once and answers every zoom from it. What is drawn is what is there.
 *
 * Nearly all of that saving is coordinate noise, not shape. The green-space
 * polygons publish longitude to **16 decimal places** — 10⁻¹¹ m, which is
 * smaller than an atom — across 219 832 vertices. Rounding to 5 dp (0.73 m of
 * longitude at 48.86° N) and dropping the points that collapse onto their
 * neighbour leaves **127 465 vertices: 92 367 of the published points, 42.0%,
 * were duplicates of the point before them once sub-millimetre noise was taken
 * off.** Nothing is decimated on top of that — no stride, no Douglas-Peucker —
 * so a park's outline here is its published outline, moved by at most 0.73 m.
 * The 20 outer rings and 2 interior rings that fall below a triangle at 1 m are
 * slivers under a metre wide; they are dropped and COUNTED, and no feature loses
 * all of its geometry that way.
 *
 * ── A trap that is worth 24% of the wire ───────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `exports/geojson` emits the geometry whether or not the geo field is in the
 * `select` — and if you DO name it, the coordinates ship twice, once as
 * `geometry` and once as a property. Measured on the fountains: 81 148 B with
 * `geo_point_2d` in the select, **61 794 B without it**, for identical output.
 * None of the three field lists below names its geo field.
 *
 * ── The keys are not keys ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `identifiant` is a key on neither list. On the equipment it has 533 distinct
 * values over 535 rows: `MU75` is both the Maison Européenne de la Photographie
 * and Le CENTQUATRE, `MA22` is both the Mairie du 20e and the Maison de la Vie
 * Associative du 7e. On the green spaces it has 955 distinct values over 984,
 * with **24 rows publishing `identifiant: null`** and six values used twice.
 * `nsq_espace_vert` is worse as an identity — 662 distinct over 984, because
 * the Bois de Vincennes is 103 separate rows and the Bois de Boulogne 46. So a
 * render id is built from the published id AND the geometry, and every reuse is
 * counted into the summary rather than silently dropping a site.
 *
 * ── Not the same three counts as the portal's own facets ───────────────────
 *
 * The three registers reach outside Paris and say so in different fields. 159
 * of the 1 323 fountains are in Pantin, Thiais, Ivry, Saint-Ouen, Bagneux,
 * Saint-Denis, Nogent and Saint-Mandé — the city's cemeteries and parks beyond
 * the périphérique. Three green spaces carry `arrondissement 94300`, and one
 * carries `75116`, the alternative code for the 16e. Nothing here folds those
 * into Paris; the field is carried verbatim and the card prints what was
 * published.

 * The THREE ways a Parisian actually gets cool, and the 12 published types

 *
 * Folded on the PHYSICS, never on the name. The register's own `type` is a list
 * of building categories — Musée, Mairie d'arrondissement, Lieux de culte — and
 * read that way the list looks like a municipal directory that wandered into a
 * climate dataset. It is not. A church is on it because five metres of limestone
 * holds last night's temperature through the afternoon, and so is a town hall,
 * a museum and a library. Naming the mechanism is what turns the list back into
 * what it is.
 *
 * ── Why three and not the five this started with ────────────────────────────
 *
 * The first cut had five, and it was five because the register has five
 * mechanisms, not because a reader has five questions. The key printed 18 rows
 * over a screen where 12 500 tree dots take 95 % of the ink, and a five-way
 * split of 535 objects inside that is a distinction nobody can spend. The fold
 * is onto the question actually asked — do I go IN, do I stand UNDER something,
 * or is there WATER — and it is exact: `brume` and `bain` are both water, and
 * the register's own residual `plein-air` is by definition outdoors, which is
 * what `ombre` already says.
 *
 * What is NOT lost: the published `type` is on every card, verbatim, and the
 * counts below stay in the blurbs. A reader who wants to know how many of the
 * 154 water refuges are misters rather than pools reads it in the key.
 *
 * The counts are the whole register, measured 2026-09-01 (they sum to 535):
 *
 *   pierre  225 — Lieux de culte 125, Musée 65, Mairie d'arrondissement 19,
 *                 Bibliothèque 16. Thermal mass you go INSIDE. The BIGGEST
 *                 family, and the one nobody would have guessed: 125 of the
 *                 city's 535 official cool spots are churches.
 *   ombre   156 — Ombrière pérenne 127, Ombrière temporaire 12, Terrain de
 *                 boules 13, Découverte et Initiation 4. Outdoors, no door and
 *                 no opening hours. The 12 temporary ombrières are the same
 *                 object with a shorter lease; the 17 the register listed as
 *                 its own residual are open ground, which is this and not a
 *                 cold room.
 *   eau     154 — Brumisateur 87, Piscine 39, Bains-douches 17, Baignade
 *                 extérieure 11. Water, whether it is sprayed at you or you get
 *                 into it. The bains-douches are here rather than with the cold

 * The canopy ladder: TWO bands on `indice_veget_sup8m_2024`, plus one for the
 * space that does not carry it.
 *
 * The metric is the share of the space covered by vegetation TALLER THAN 8 m,
 * from a 2024 survey. It is not "how green" — it is how much of the ground has
 * something over it that casts shade at three in the afternoon, which is the
 * only kind of green that matters to a heatwave.
 *
 * ── Why two, where there were six ──────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Six steps of one hue is a ramp, and a ramp is read by COMPARING swatches to
 * each other. These fills are drawn at alpha 0.34 over a photorealistic city
 * (`FRAICHEUR_FILL_ALPHA`, and the number is not negotiable — a cadastre
 * boundary underneath has to survive) so no two adjacent steps of a six-step
 * ramp are separable on the map at all: the reader gets six key rows and three
 * distinguishable greens. Six rows were being spent to answer a question that
 * has two answers — is there shade over this park or is there not.
 *
 * The cut is at 0.25 and not at the median (0.3197) because the median is a
 * property of the payload and the question is not: a quarter of the ground
 * under something taller than a bus is the point at which a park stops being
 * a lawn. FIXED rather than quantiled per payload for the same reason it always
 * was — a bin that meant one thing in the 12e and another in the 1er would make
 * two viewports incomparable.
 *
 * Measured across all 983 spaces that carry the metric (p25 0.1083, p50 0.3197,
 * p75 0.5366), the fold is:
 *
 *   clair    401 — v < 0.25. Was nue 66 + rare 169 + clairsemee 166.
 *   ombrage  582 — v ≥ 0.25. Was moyenne 186 + dense 164 + couverte 232.
 *   inconnue   1 — the metric is null. Grey, and never folded into `clair`.
 *
 * 401 + 582 + 1 = 984.
 *
 * WHAT THE FOLD COSTS, and it is one thing. `nue` was its OWN band and not the
 * bottom of the ramp, because "no tall vegetation was found here" — EXACTLY
 * zero, on 66 spaces — is a different statement from "a little was". Those 66
 * are now inside `clair`. The statement is not lost: it is in this band's own
 * blurb, it is on the card of every one of the 66, and it is the number the
 * heatwave row quotes against itself (11 of the 23 declared heatwave spaces
