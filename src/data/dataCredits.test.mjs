// The attribution list's structure — not its wording.
//
// This file exists because one specific merge accident has now happened TWICE
// in this list, and nothing caught it either time. Two branches each append a
// credit at the same point; the three-way merge keeps both bodies but loses the
// `},\n  {` between them; and the result is ONE object literal with two `key`
// properties and two `html` properties. JavaScript takes the last of each, the
// first credit vanishes, and every runtime check still passes — the array is
// well formed, every entry has a key, no key is duplicated. It is simply one
// shorter, and a layer that legally requires attribution has none.
//
// It cost `power-grid-osm` its ODbL notice (found 2026-08-31, by accident,
// while adding an unrelated credit) and then `bison-fute-events` its Licence
// Ouverte notice (found 2026-09-01, the same way). `registerDataCredits`
// de-duplicates BY KEY across entries, which does not help: there is only one
// entry to see.
//
// The guard has to read the SOURCE, because by the time the module is imported
// the evidence has already been discarded by the parser.
