 *
 * **Le bâtiment comme pivot** — what a click on a volume can say once the RNB
 * has told it which ground it stands on.
 *
 * ── What was already there, and what was missing ────────────────────────────
 *
 * A BD TOPO volume already resolves to its RNB identity, its BAN addresses and
 * its cadastral parcels: `rnbPivot.js` does it in one keyless request the
 * click fires, and `bdtopoBuildings.js` republishes the card ~170 ms later
 * with those lines on it. What it could not then say is the three things a
 * reader looking at a building actually wants — **what it last sold for, what
 * has been authorised on it, and what the PLU allows there**.
 *
 * The cross-referencing audit (#128) recorded this as blocked because the three
 * lookups are "des requêtes réseau déclenchées par une carte, ce que le dépôt
 * ne fait nulle part aujourd'hui". Two halves of that turned out to be wrong,
 * and finding out is what made this module small:
 *
 *  1. **The pattern exists.** `cadastreParcels.selectParcel` publishes its
 *     card immediately, fires two network lookups, caches by parcel key,
 *     aborts on re-selection and repaints only if the selection has not
 *     moved — and `bdtopoBuildings` itself already does the same for the RNB.
 *  2. **No network call is needed at all.** DVF, Sitadel and the GPU are three
 *     layers this application already loads for the same viewport. The sales
 *     carry `id_parcelle`, the permits carry the cadastral reference they were
 *     granted for, and the zoning is a polygon set with a point query. So the
 *     answer is a READ of what is already resident — which is the property the
 *     plan called an obstacle ("toutes ses cartes se composent sur de la
 *     donnée déjà résidente") and is in fact the solution.
 *
 * ── What that buys, and what it costs ───────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The cost is that a line exists only while its layer is on. That is the
 * `layerJoins.js` contract — **absence is ordinary** — and it is the honest
 * shape here rather than a compromise: a card that fetched DVF behind the
 * reader's back would be a second scan of a register the reader chose not to
 * open, at the radius and the vintage that reader never picked.
 *
 * Each line therefore names its register, and a card with none of the three
 * layers on is exactly the card this repository drew before.
 *
 * ── The join key, and the one place it can slip ─────────────────────────────
 *
 * The 14-character cadastral parcel id — `75056000AB0123`, five for the
 * commune, three for the préfixe, two for the section, four for the number.
 * The RNB publishes it whole. DVF publishes it whole, as `id_parcelle`.
 * Sitadel publishes it **in pieces** and without the préfixe, which the
 * cadastre supplies when the permit is placed — so {@link cadastralParcelId}
 * assembles it, and a piece it does not have is a refusal rather than a
 * padded guess. A préfixe treated as `000` when it is `801` names a different
 * parcel in the same commune, and Toulouse publishes 46 of them.
 *
 * Pure: no fetch, no DOM, no Cesium, no clock.
