/**
 * When a point-centred French scan stops drawing points and starts drawing
 * cells, and the box it asks about when it does.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. `addressScanLayer.js` asks the register about a DISC around
 * the point the camera is looking at — 300 m for DVF, 200 m for the DPE. That
 * is the right question at street level and the wrong one from a thousand
 * metres up, where the disc covers a few percent of what is on screen and the
 * answer reads as a patch of confetti in the middle of an empty city. Measured
 * on the view that prompted this module: 0.28 km² scanned against ~5 km²
 * visible, 6 %.
 *
 * THE FIX IS NOT MORE DOTS. Widening the disc to the view was measured too —
 * ~3 000 mutations and ~12 000 diagnostics for one Lyon viewport, 10 MB of
 * rows — and it buys nothing a reader can use: three thousand € markers carry
 * the same information as four hundred, made unreadable. The question changes
 * with the altitude. "What did THIS building sell for" is only askable close
 * in; from higher up the question is "which block is dear", and that is a
 * different mark: one symbol per cell, not one per sale.
 *
 * So each layer runs two regimes and this module owns the switch:
 *
 *   - below {@link SCAN_CELL_MIN_ALTITUDE_M}, the disc, unchanged;
 *   - above it, a grid-aligned BOX, aggregated into cells by the proxy.
 *
 * THE BOX IS BUILT FROM THE LOOK-AT POINT, NEVER FROM `computeViewRectangle`.
 * That is the lesson `cadastreFeed.js` and `urbanismeGpu.js` both paid for: on
 * the oblique camera this globe opens with, the view rectangle runs to the
 * horizon, so a box cut from it is tens of kilometres deep and centred
 * nowhere near what the reader is looking at. Gating on ALTITUDE and centring
 * on the look-at point is the same arithmetic those two layers settled on.
 *
 * THE BOX SNAPS TO A GRID, and that is what makes panning free. A box derived
 * continuously from the camera moves with every settle, so every settle is a
 * new cache key and a new round trip. Snapped to the band's tile, a reader
 * panning a few streets asks the identical question and `runScan`'s own
 * signature guard answers it from what is already drawn.
 *
 * Dependency-free and side-effect-free — no Cesium, no DOM — so the layers,
 * the Vite proxy and `node --test` all read the same box arithmetic.
 *
 * @module data/scanRegime
 */

/**
 * Altitude at which a scan stops being about a place and starts being about an
 * area, in metres.
 *
 * 600 m, because that is where the disc stops covering the view. A nadir camera
 * at 600 m sees about 700 m of ground across the short side, which the 300 m
 * DVF disc fills; at 1 300 m — the altitude this globe lands on after a flight
 * to an address — it sees some 5 km² and the disc covers 6 % of it.
 *
 * Below this the reader can point at a building and expects one sale, one
 * diagnostic, one parcel. Above it they cannot resolve a building at all, and
 * a mark per sale is ink spent on a distinction the screen cannot carry.

 * The two cell bands, and why there are exactly two.

 * `tileDeg` is the unit the box is built and cached in; a box is always TWO
 * tiles on each axis, so a scan is always four tiles whatever the band. That
 * constant is deliberate: it fixes the upstream cost of a camera settle at
 * eight requests (two per tile for the DPE — see `dpeFeed.js`) instead of
 * letting it grow with altitude.
 *
 * `dvfUnit` is the shape the DVF proxy draws a box's sales on, and since
 * 2026-09-21 it is the cadastre's own, not a grid: the PLOTS the sales name on
 * the fine band, their cadastral SECTIONS on the coarse one — see
 * `dvfFeed.aggregateSalesIntoPlots` for the measurement that put the switch
 * here. The DPE keeps its cells, whose size the ADEME's `geo_agg` picks from
 * the span of the box (geohash precision 7, ~107 × 152 m, for a 0.01° tile;
 * precision 6, ~853 × 607 m, for a 0.04° one — measured 2026-09-14 at Lyon).
