/**
 * Bâti 3D (FR) — every building France has surveyed, at its own altitude.
 *
 * The IGN's BD TOPO published as vector tiles: a footprint, a measured height,
 * a floor altitude, a use, a dwelling count and a national building identifier
 * (RNB), for roughly 47 million buildings. This layer draws the ones in the
 * viewport as volumes and hands the rest of the record to the card.
 *
 * Keyless and unproxied, straight from `data.geopf.fr/tms`, which is unusual in
 * this codebase and deliberate: the tiles are CORS-open, rate-limited at 400
 * req/min (ten times the raster services), and served with `max-age=21 days`,
 * so the browser's own cache does the job a proxy would otherwise do. There is
 * nothing to hide and nothing to key.
 *
 * ── What the drawing is careful about ───────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * • **A building is drawn where France says it is, not where it fits.** The
 *   altitudes are BD TOPO's own (NGF-IGN69, converted h = H + N), so the block
 *   keeps the exact relative relief IGN measured between neighbours. What the
 *   layer adds is a per-cell RE-ANCHORING onto the surface the globe actually
 *   renders — because a 30 m global terrain and a 20 cm national survey do not
 *   agree, and the disagreement is where buildings float or drown. The shift is
 *   local — the median over a ~1.1 km cell — so a hillside stays a hillside
 *   instead of being flattened by a single viewport-wide correction.
 *
 * • **Every building is measured under its own feet.** The rendered surface is
 *   read where the building stands, via `globe.getHeight` — the resident terrain
 *   triangles, one synchronous call per volume and no network at all. The first
 *   version took ONE height per ~1.1 km cell and differenced it against each
 *   building's own floor; on flat ground that difference is the datum error, but
 *   on the Croix-Rousse it is the drop from the cell centre to the building, and
 *   it lifted whole blocks of Lyon into the air. Per-building sampling was priced
 *   as unaffordable against the network DEM; against resident triangles it is
 *   free. What is left after the shift is the mesh disagreeing with the survey
 *   building by building, and the volume absorbs it by growing rather than
 *   moving (see `seatOnGround`).
 *
 * • **The height and the floor come from different places, and the card says
 *   which.** `published` = both altitudes are IGN's. `height` = floor is IGN's,
 *   roof is floor + the published height — that is all of Paris, whose buildings
 *   come from the cadastre with an interpolated Z and carry no roof altitude at
 *   all. `surface` = nothing altimetric survived and the floor is the rendered
 *   ground. Four bases, counted separately, never averaged into one number.
 *
 * • **`precision_altimetrique: 9999` is discarded, not read.** It is the IGN
 *   sentinel for "no Z", and taken literally it is a ±10 km tolerance that would
 *   validate anything.
 *
 * • **A truncated city looks like a small city.** Past `BDTOPO_VOLUME_CAP` the
 *   layer stops drawing and reports `saturated`, because a straight edge through
 *   the middle of Marseille is otherwise indistinguishable from the edge of the
 *   data.
 *
 * • **The volumes are a support, not only a subject.** `buildingTheme.js` lets
 *   one other layer at a time paint these instances — DPE, €/m², the state of a
 *   permit — through `applyBuildingTheme()`, which rewrites the per-instance
 *   colours of the batch in place instead of rebuilding a 14 000-volume
 *   primitive. A volume the theme has no point for is NOT left looking graded:
 *   it keeps its usage hue washed to near-grey (`unknownBuildingCss`), which
 *   measures ΔE76 36.5 from the nearest class of any palette the themes bring —
 *   a just-noticeable difference is 2.3 — and the row states how many volumes
 *   are painted and how many are not. Nothing about the no-theme path changes:
 *   with no theme registered the colour is the same byte for byte.
 *
 * • **Google 3D already contains these buildings.** On the photoreal stack the
 *   volumes are hidden rather than double-drawn, and the status says so instead
 *   of leaving the operator to wonder why the layer looks broken.

 *   proximity instead, and the line says `plus proche à N m`. On a card whose
 *   whole subject is WHICH building you clicked, an unlabelled guess is the one
 *   thing worse than a missing line.
 *
 * • **A building with no address is normal.** 10 of 160 Lyon buildings the RNB
 *   publishes carry none. The line is omitted rather than filled with the
 *   nearest street, which is what `cadastreParcelDetail.js` had to buy with a
