/**
 * @module data/loyersFeed
 *
 * The **carte des loyers** — what it would cost to rent at this address, from
 * the only national source there is, and everything that source says about how
 * much it does not know.
 *
 * Cityscan cites *« Observatoires immobiliers »* among its own sources for the
 * Immobilier theme. This is the file behind that phrase for anywhere outside
 * the twenty-odd agglomerations an *observatoire local des loyers* covers:
 * the Ministry's own econometric prediction, published per commune, France
 * entière hors Mayotte, licence ouverte, no key.
 *
 * ── WHAT THE NUMBER IS, AND FOUR THINGS IT IS NOT ───────────────────────────
 * Read from the millésime 2025 guide (`guide-dutilisation-des-donnees.pdf`,
 * December 2025) and confirmed against the four published files:
 *
 * 1. **It is a prediction, not a median.** The guide says so in as many words:
 *    the indicators come from an econometric model, *« il ne s'agit donc pas de
 *    loyers « médians » ou « moyens » »*. Nobody in this commune necessarily
 *    pays it.
 * 2. **It is CHARGES COMPRISES.** Every French rental listing a reader has ever
 *    seen quotes rent hors charges; this file quotes it charges comprises, for
 *    an unfurnished dwelling let in Q3 2025. Printing it beside a listing
 *    without saying so overstates the listing by the charges.
 * 3. **It is per m² of a BIEN TYPE, not of your flat.** Each segment has its
 *    own reference dwelling — 52 m² for an apartment, 37 m² for a T1-T2, 72 m²
 *    for a T3-plus, 92 m² for a house — and the €/m² is the model's answer for
 *    THAT dwelling. Multiplying it by 120 m² does not predict a 120 m² flat.
 * 4. **It is built on ASKING prices**, from leboncoin and the Groupe SeLoger
 *    over 2019-2025. It is what landlords asked, not what tenants signed.
 *
 * ── THE MEASUREMENT THAT DECIDES HOW THIS IS DRAWN ──────────────────────────
 * Measured over the four live files on 2026-09-08 — 34 900 communes each, the
 * same commune set in all four, no missing value anywhere:
 *
 *   segment  commune-based   maille   EPCI    median €/m²   range
 *   app          4 871       30 029      0       10,00      6,28 – 37,89
 *   app12        3 139       31 761      0       11,97      7,09 – 40,43
 *   app3         3 378       31 459     63        8,53      5,49 – 37,61
 *   maison       3 619       30 673    608        8,75      5,74 – 30,22
 *
 * **Six communes in seven get a figure that was not computed for them.** With
 * fewer than about a hundred observations, the model falls back to a *maille*
 * of neighbouring communes holding at least 500 — 3 079 such mailles for
 * apartments — and every commune in the maille receives the identical number.
 * Measured: the 30 029 `maille` apartment rows carry only **2 375 distinct
 * values**, and the largest cluster is **77 communes sharing one price**.
 * La Haute-Beaume (05066) and La Bâtie-des-Fonds (26030) are 120 km apart in
 * two different régions and both are told 9,757696 €/m², to the microcent.
 *
 * So `basis` travels with every figure and the card says it out loud. A
 * borrowed number presented as a local one is the single most misleading thing
 * this file could be made to do.
 *
 * ── Trap 1: `nbobs_com` is NOT the sample the figure was computed on ────────
 * Chattancourt (55106) publishes `nbobs_com = 9` for apartments and
 * `TYPPRED = maille`; for T3-plus it publishes `nbobs_com = 5` and
 * `TYPPRED = EPCI`. The observation count is how many ads were seen in the
 * commune, full stop — the model used them or it did not, and only `TYPPRED`
 * says which. A card that read "9 observations" beside a maille figure would
 * be attributing a national model's answer to nine adverts.
 *
 * ── Trap 2: the published interval is enormous, and it is the honest part ───
 * `lwr.IPm2` and `upr.IPm2` are a PREDICTION interval — the range an individual
 * dwelling's rent is expected to fall in, not the precision of the estimate.
 * Measured over the 34 900 apartment rows, its width is **45,7 % of the value
 * at the median** (p10 37,2 %, p90 54,8 %, max 123,5 %), and it barely narrows
 * where the data is thickest: 45,0 % on commune-based rows against 45,8 % on
 * maille rows. Paris 9e, with 7 870 observations of its own, is published as
 * 33,55 €/m² with an interval of 26,30 – 42,80.
 *
 * That is why this module never returns a bare number. The interval is not a
 * footnote on this source, it is most of what the source knows.
 *
 * ── Trap 3: even a dense arrondissement borrows a segment ───────────────────
 * Paris 13e is `commune` for all three apartment segments and **`maille` for
 * houses**, on 54 observations, at 22,56 €/m² with an interval of
 * 13,29 – 38,32 — a spread of 125 % of the value. The segment, not the
 * commune, is the unit of trust.
 *
 * ── Trap 4: the file is CP1252, semicolon-delimited, comma-decimal, CRLF ────
 * Byte 0xE2 in `La Bâtie-des-Fonds` is not valid UTF-8, so a default
 * `response.text()` mangles a fifth of French commune names. `decodeLoyersCsv`
 * owns the decode and a unit test pins it on real bytes.
 *
 * ── Scope ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * France entière **hors Mayotte** — 976 is absent from all four files, and the
 * DOM that are present (971-974) carry their own `DOM_n` mesh identifiers.
 * Commune geography as of 1 January 2025. Paris, Lyon and Marseille are
 * published PER ARRONDISSEMENT, so this is one of the registers that must NOT
 * be handed a folded code — see `communeCode.js`.
 *
 * Dependency-free and side-effect-free: decoding, parsing and projection only.
 * The `/api/loyers-fr` proxy imports it; nothing in the browser bundle does.
