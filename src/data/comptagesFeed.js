/**
 * @module comptagesFeed
 *
 * The reading of the only French road dataset that has actually COUNTED a
 * vehicle — Paris's own permanent counting loops, and the 27 772 889 hourly
 * readings they have published.
 *
 * ── Why this exists next to two road layers that already draw Paris ─────────
 * `traffic.js` is TomTom flow: bring-your-own-key, and on a keyless build its
 * own header says it runs a SIMULATION — "white dots at hardcoded per-road-class
 * speeds". `roadStatusFrance.js` is DATEX II incident reporting from the DIR,
 * and its own header says "Île-de-France has no publisher at all". Neither has
 * ever counted a vehicle inside Paris. This one publishes `q`, whose field
 * description is verbatim *"Débit (nombre de véhicules comptés pendant
 * l'heure)"* — an integer of cars, on a named arc of a named street, keyless,
 * ODbL, since 1996-10-03 (the oldest `date_debut` in the current hour).
 *
 * ── It is NOT live. It is J-2, and the layer says so on every surface ───────
 * Measured 2026-09-01T21:02Z: `metas.default.data_processed` =
 * 2026-09-01T01:02:50+00:00, `dcat.accrualperiodicity` = Quotidienne,
 * `dcat.granularity` = Horaire — and `max(t_1h)` = 2026-08-30T22:00:00+00:00,
 * i.e. 2026-08-31T00:00+02:00 Paris, the closing stamp of local Sunday
 * 2026-08-30. A nightly batch that lands the day before yesterday, ~46 h behind
 * the wall clock. The word "live" never appears in this layer.
 *
 * ── So the edition is a WEEK, discovered and floored ────────────────────────
 * A J-2 feed has no "now" worth drawing, and one hour of a Tuesday is a fact
 * about that Tuesday. The unit is therefore the last COMPLETE Monday–Sunday
 * local week: `newestComptagesWeek()` reads `max(t_1h)`, drops the day in
 * progress, walks back to the last Sunday, and refuses anything older than
 * `COMPTAGES_WEEK_FLOOR` — the week this module was measured against. A
 * discovery older than the floor is a malformed answer, not a new fact.
 * Measured on that week (2026-08-24 → 2026-08-30): 2 977 arcs × 168 h =
 * **500 136 rows, every arc with exactly 168** — no gaps, no decay.
 *
 * ── The fold IS the hour cursor's axis, and it is 48 slots, not 168 ─────────
 * `comptagesParis.js` now lets a reader scrub the hour, and what it scrubs is
 * exactly what this module builds: `wq` and `eq`, two 24-hour profiles of means
 * per arc. That is 48 published values per arc and NOT the 168 individual hours
 * of the week, and the difference is a claim about the data that has to be
 * stated rather than implied by a control:
 *
 *   • a slot is a mean over the FIVE weekdays or the TWO weekend days, so it
 *     describes a typical Tuesday-ish hour and never a particular Tuesday.
 *     Every label downstream says "type" for that reason.
 *   • the mean is taken over the hours that REPORTED, which is what `nq`/`nk`
 *     are for: of the 71 448 weekday cells, 37 062 carry all five days, 29 979
 *     carry none, and 4 407 (6.17 %) are partial. A cell built from one Tuesday
 *     is not marked differently from one built from five, and that is the
 *     coarsest thing this feed does — the card prints the reported-hour totals
 *     (`hq`, `hk`) so the reader can see how thin a profile is.
 *   • a slot with no reporting day at all stays `null`, never 0, all the way to
 *     the renderer, which draws it as its own dash. See Trap 3.
 *
 * Publishing the 168 raw hours instead would cost 3.5x the payload to answer a
 * question — "what happened on Wednesday the 26th at 18 h" — that a J-2 weekly
 * batch is the wrong instrument for anyway.
 *
 * ── The five upstream calls, and why there are five ─────────────────────────
 * 1. `records?select=max(t_1h)` — the edition. ~100 B, 0.27 s.
 * 2. `exports/geojson?where=t_1h=<week's last stamp>` — geometry AND names in
 *    one shot. 1 668 654 B raw, **346 713 B on the wire with gzip**, 2 977
 *    features, 2 977 distinct `iu_ac`, zero duplicates, 2 946 LineStrings.
 * 3–4. eight `group_by=iu_ac,hour(t_1h)` calls, four per day-type, six hours of
 *    the clock each. 71 448 cells per day-type, 142 896 in all, 10 248 946 B,
 *    1.06–2.68 s per call.
 * 5. `group_by=iu_ac,etat_barre` over the week — 3 843 rows, 204 875 B, 0.71 s.
 *
 * ── Trap 1: the geometry does NOT come from the referential ─────────────────
 * The obvious source is `referentiel-comptages-routiers`, and it is the wrong
 * one. Measured 2026-09-01: 3 739 rows for **3 348 distinct `iu_ac`** — 338 ids
 * repeated, with no usable tiebreak (`date_fin` maxes at 2023-01-01 on 3 303 of
 * them while those same arcs are demonstrably still counting in 2026). It also
 * misses 31 of the arcs that ARE counting, and carries 402 that are not.
 * The counts export carries its own `geo_shape` on every row: 2 977 features
 * for 2 977 distinct ids, one row per arc, fresher, and 0.27 s against 7.7 s.
 * So geometry is taken from the measurement itself and the referential is not
 * fetched at all.
 *
 * ── Trap 2: 31 arcs count from nowhere, and NOTHING can place them ──────────
 * 31 of the 2 977 features have `"geometry": null`. They are exactly the 31
 * whose `date_debut` AND `date_fin` are also null — rows the referential never
 * received — and I checked all 31 against the full 3 739-row referential
 * export: **0 are present, 0 have a geometry**. 19 of them are actively
 * measuring (15 both flow and occupancy, 3 flow only, 1 occupancy only) on real
 * named streets — Bd_Magenta, Bd_Malesherbes, Av_Kleber, Pl_de_la_Nation. They
 * are counted and named in `unplaced`, and never placed at a centroid.
 *
 * ── Trap 3: `q = 0` is a MEASUREMENT and `q = null` is not ──────────────────
 * Over the 500 136 rows of the week, `q = 0` on **234** and `q` is null on
 * **218 707**. An `avg(q) ?? 0` would convert 218 707 unmeasured hours into
 * measured zeroes at a ratio of 935 : 1, and paint 1 247 dead loops as empty
 * roads. Every profile slot here is `null` or a number, never a coerced zero,
 * and the card draws them through `textSparkline`, whose whole thesis is that a
 * gap is `·` and never `▁`.
 *
 * ── Trap 4: `etat_trafic` is a pure function of `k`, so it is not a colour ───
 * The field description publishes the thresholds (Fluide 0 ≤ K < 15 %,
 * Pré-saturé 15–30, Saturé 30–50, Bloqué ≥ 50). I tested the derivation seven
 * ways over all 500 136 rows and found **zero counter-examples**: `Inconnu`
 * appears on exactly the 209 874 rows where `k` is null, and each band matches
 * its interval exactly. So the city's own colour field carries nothing the
 * occupancy does not — and it says nothing whatever about the vehicle count:
 * it reads `Inconnu` on 51 241 rows that DO carry one. It is reported on the
 * card as the operator's own reading and is never this layer's colour.
 *
 * ── Trap 5: the ODSQL surface ───────────────────────────────────────────────
 * • An alias declared in BOTH `select` and `group_by` is HTTP 400 *"Alias 'd'
 *   is declared several times"*. Declared in `group_by` only, it still comes
 *   back in the results — which is why `COMPTAGES_PROFILE_SELECT` has no `h`.
 * • Grouped queries cap at **offset + limit ≤ 30 000** (HTTP 400
 *   `InvalidRESTParameterError` at 100 000). 2 977 × 24 = 71 448 cells cannot
 *   be paged, so the profile is split on `hour(t_1h)` in the WHERE clause
 *   instead — which works, and gives 17 862 cells a call.
 * • `date'…'` literals are day-granular with a bare date and hour-granular with
 *   a full timestamp: `t_1h > date'2026-08-29'` skips the whole of the 29th.
 *   Every window here carries a full `THH:MM:SS`.
 * • `&timezone=Europe/Paris` shifts `hour(t_1h)` in `group_by` AND in `where`,
 *   verified against the same arc read both ways (+2 h in August). Without it
 *   every rush hour sits two hours early in summer.
 * • `t_1h` is the END of the hour ("fin de la période d'élaboration"), so the
 *   09:00 stamp is 08:00–09:00 traffic. `COMPTAGES_HOURS` re-keys every profile
 *   onto the hour that was MEASURED.
 * • A grouped response's `total_count` echoes the rows returned, not the number
 *   of groups. It is never read as a cardinality here.
 *
 * ── Trap 6: the phantom arc ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * One record has `iu_ac = "*"` and every other field null, including `t_1h`.
 * It surfaces in an UNFILTERED `group_by=iu_ac` (2 989 buckets against 2 977)
 * and is dropped by any `where` on `t_1h` — but `projectComptagesArcs` refuses
 * it by name anyway, because a filter that only works by accident is not one.
 *
 * Dependency-free and side-effect-free (no Cesium, no DOM) so it runs
 * identically in the browser, in the Vite dev-server proxy and under
 * `node --test`.

 * The finished pack — 2 977 arcs, each with its polyline, its street name, both
 * ends of the arc, two 24-hour flow profiles, two 24-hour occupancy profiles,
 * its reported-hour counts and its declared state — measures **1 374 229 bytes
 * raw and 305 551 gzipped**, built and weighed rather than estimated. That is
 * why this layer has ONE regime: it is barely half of what `sup-fr` already
 * ships whole (0.62 MB gzipped) and half of the `schools-fr` maillage
 * (0.63 MB), and the whole of it fits in a box 0.1721° × 0.0896° — 12.6 km by
 * 10.0 km. There is nothing to thin, no national fold to make, and no viewport
 * worth paging.
