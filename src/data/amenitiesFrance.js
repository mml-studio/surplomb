 *
 * Où est le plus proche — the things a daily life in France actually touches,
 * drawn from the two registers that publish them and refusing the six things
 * another layer on this globe already draws better.
 *
 * `amenitiesFeed.js` holds the reading of INSEE's Base permanente des
 * équipements and the FINESS register and every trap in both;
 * `amenitiesDepartements.js` holds the national fold; `amenitiesMesh.js` holds
 * the thinning; `amenityFamilyIcons.js` holds the marks. This file is the
 * rendering.
 *
 * ── What is on the map ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * **443 169 marks**, folded from 521 672 register rows, in thirteen families:
 * 186 288 restaurants · 44 800 commerces de bouche · 44 598 boulangeries ·
 * 30 213 médecins généralistes · 22 838 salles de sport · 21 086 banques ·
 * 20 020 lieux culturels · 19 354 commerces alimentaires · 19 216 pharmacies ·
 * 16 832 points de contact La Poste · 10 346 stations-service · 3 953
 * gendarmeries et commissariats · 3 625 bassins de natation.
 *
 * Seven of them arrived on 2026-09-08 to cover Cityscan's own POI taxonomy —
 * see `amenitiesFeed.js` for the codes, the cost and the four types that
 * register simply cannot serve.
 *
 * ── 2026-09-15: the marks became PLATES, and the reason is a measurement ────
 * Until that day this layer drew fourteen families as bare dots of 5 to 12 px,
 * separated by hue alone. Two numbers ended it:
 *
 *   - **four pairs of the palette sat under ΔE 20** and seven under ΔE 21, the
 *     worst being `pharmacie`/`banque` at **15,9**;
 *   - **all fourteen hues sat between L\* 32,8 and L\* 63,9** — a band with no
 *     contrast against a forest, a field or a slate roof, which is most of
 *     France from 30 km up.
 *
 * The load therefore moved off the hue: a punched silhouette on a tinted plate
 * names the family, the plate makes it findable, and the palette was rebuilt to
 * maximise its WORST pair rather than its average one — **min ΔE 39,3**, every
 * L\* at or above 55,7. Both the marks and the numbers are argued where they
 * live, in `amenityFamilyIcons.js` and in {@link AMENITY_COLORS}.
 *
 * ── And the key became the CONTROL ──────────────────────────────────────────
 * Thirteen families over one street is a legible map only if the reader wanted
 * thirteen. Usually they want one. So every row of the key is that family's own
 * switch ({@link AMENITIES_WITHDRAWN_FAMILIES} is the only thing it cannot
 * reach), and the selection goes into the QUESTION rather than being applied to
 * the answer — `familles=` on the proxy, and a filtered budget in the thinner.
 *
 * That ordering is not tidiness. Measured over greater Paris (48.62-48.95 N,
 * 2.16-2.45 E) on 2026-09-15: the box holds 46 422 marks, `/sites` answers
 * 12 000 of them rarest-family-first, and **zero** of the 4 076 boulangeries
 * survive that cap. Asked for as `familles=boulangerie`, all 4 076 arrive. A
 * filter applied after the cap would have answered "there are no bakeries in
 * Paris".
 *
 * ── Two refusals, and they are features of this layer rather than omissions ─
 * The brief's row opens with *écoles*, and this layer draws none. `schools-fr`
 * already draws 68 158 open, geolocated schools from the ministry's own
 * Annuaire keyed on the UAI, and `sup-fr` 6 914 higher-education sites. BPE's
 * enseignement domain is 79 743 rows over the same buildings from a source that
 * **carries no UAI column at all**, so the two could not even be reconciled.
 * Redrawing them would double every school in France from the worse of the two
 * registers.
 *
 * The second is *hôpitaux*, and it is newer: the 2 211 FINESS establishments
 * moved to « Santé & secours » on 2026-09-15, where they sit beside the 64 232
 * practice addresses and the DREES accessibility indicator. A hospital is not
 * an everyday errand. The pack still carries them — `AMENITY_FAMILIES` is the
 * mesh's on-the-wire encoding and cannot lose a member — so the withdrawal is
 * in the drawing, not in the data; see {@link AMENITIES_WITHDRAWN_FAMILIES}.
 *
 * The key carries a row for each refusal, with a count and no swatch, because a
 * reader who does not find schools or hospitals here should be told where they
 * are rather than left to conclude the data is missing.
 *
 * Four more refusals, each with the measurement behind it, are argued in
 * `amenitiesFeed.js`: BPE's 28 819 charge points (`irve-fr` has 39 579, live),
 * its 20 334 pharmacies (FINESS has a stable key and a monthly refresh), its
 * 695 urgences (547 of them within 200 m of a hospital already drawn), and its
 * 99 280 transport rows (96 253 of which are taxi operators' addresses).
 *
 * And one CONDITIONAL withdrawal, `medecin`, measured on 2026-09-15: 74.6 % of
 * the 30 213 BPE dots have a conventioned practice address within 50 m and
 * 91.5 % within 200 m, at a median distance of 10 m where they match. The two
 * registers describe one population, so only one of them draws it — and the
 * 8.5 % the CNAM does not carry is the stated price of that rule rather than an
 * omission. Switch « Santé & secours » off and the family comes back.
 *
 * ── Three regimes, and what decides between them ───────────────────────────
 *   national — 96 painted départements, shaded by the SHARE of the
 *              département's communes that hold at least one everyday
 *              equipment. A count would have been a population map; see
 *              `amenitiesDepartements.js`. Entered on the view's LATITUDE span
 *              (≥ 9.5°, metropolitan France being 9.8° tall).
 *   maillage — real positions, thinned per family so no family can be squeezed
 *              off the map by a bigger one. See `amenitiesMesh.js`.
 *   sites    — every amenity in the box, with its card, from the proxy's
 *              `/sites` route. Gated at 0.35°, and the densest square that
 *              ceiling allows anywhere in France — 48.65 N, 2.20 E, which is
 *              Paris and its inner south-eastern suburbs — holds 53 121 dots,
 *              of which the proxy answers 12 000 and says so.
 *
 * ── What each channel means, and what the size does NOT mean ────────────────
 * SHAPE is the family, and it is what a reader decodes without the key: a fork
 * and knife is a restaurant, a trolley is a supermarket. COLOUR is the family
 * too — the same fact on a second channel, which is what lets a reader find all
 * of one kind at a glance rather than reading thirteen silhouettes. It is a
 * categorical ladder, never a ramp: a pharmacy is not "more" than a post
 * office.
 *
 * SIZE is where this layer differs from every French point layer beside it, and
 * the difference is deliberate. `schools-fr` sizes by roll, `sup-fr` by
 * enrolment, `irve-fr` by charging power. **This point set has no magnitude at
 * all.** A pharmacy is one pharmacy; neither register publishes a capacity, a
 * headcount or a turnover for any of the thirteen families. So size here is a
 * LEGIBILITY rule and is stated as one: the rarer a family is nationally, the
 * larger its plate, so that 3 625 bassins are not lost under 186 288
 * restaurants. It is a property of the palette, not a property of the
 * equipment, and no card ever reads a size back as a quantity.
 *
 * What the card DOES read back is the multiplicity, because that is real:
 * 60 270 GP rows sit on 30 215 coordinates and the biggest single address holds
 * **146 médecins généralistes** (Paris 14e). The mark is the address; the card
 * says how many practitioners are at it.
 *
 * ── The remaining channel is honesty about position ─────────────────────────
 * Both registers publish how well they know where a thing is, and this layer
 * draws that rather than hiding it. A mark whose position is a street number
 * (451 983 of the 521 672 drawn rows) is drawn at full opacity; one the
 * register only places in the street (36 763), or grades no better than "voie
 * probable" (4 933), or declines to grade at all (27 993, among them the 3 626
 * bassins de natation whose census publishes no precision anywhere) is drawn
 * softer, and the card says so in words.
 *
 * It used to be a SAND HALO as well, and that halo went with the dots on
 * 2026-09-15. Every plate now carries the same black ring, because the ring is
 * what makes a mark findable on a photograph — and legibility is not something
 * to spend on a data-quality flag. What the neighbours' rings used to say
 * (`schools-fr` outlines in black, `sup-fr` in white) the silhouette now says
 * better: on a stacked address the SHAPE tells a reader which register drew the
 * mark, and it does so without a key.
 *
 * And where a register admits it drew the position rather than found it — BPE's
 * `QUALITE_GEOLOC = 33`, "position aléatoire dans la commune", and FINESS's
 * 4 646 ADMIN-EXPRESS commune centroids — there is no dot at all. **8 626 rows
 * in the drawn families are refused on those grounds and 12 902 more publish no
 * coordinate**, all of them counted and reported on the national card. The
 * widening of 2026-09-08 found most of them: the dense commercial codes are
 * the worst geocoded in the file, 7 704 restaurants alone. Mayotte's whole
 * everyday BPE equipment is still among them, which is why the island carries
 * FINESS pharmacies and hospitals and nothing else.

/**
 * Fourteen keys, thirteen drawn — and a palette rebuilt on 2026-09-15 against
 * a measurement rather than a mood.
 *
 * ── WHAT THE OLD ONE WAS, AND WHAT WAS WRONG WITH IT ────────────────────────
 *
 * The first palette was chosen "mid-dark and warm-leaning" to sit under the
 * layers around it. Two numbers say why that could not hold fourteen families
 * on live imagery:
 *
 *   - **Four pairs sat under ΔE 20**, seven under ΔE 21. The worst was
 *     `pharmacie`/`banque` at **15,9**, then `restaurant`/`commerce` 18,0,
 *     `boulangerie`/`sport` 18,8, `courses`/`sport` 19,0. At the 5-8 px those
 *     families were drawn at, that is the same dot in the same colour.
 *   - **Every hue sat between L\* 32,8 and L\* 63,9.** A mid-dark dot has no
 *     contrast against a forest, a field or a slate roof — which is most of
 *     France from 30 km up. The layer had no legibility channel at all.
 *
 * ── WHAT REPLACED IT ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The silhouette now names the family (`amenityFamilyIcons.js`), so the hue no
 * longer has to carry recognition alone — but it still has to separate thirteen
 * plates in one street, and a plate is 40 units of flat colour where a dot was
 * 5 px. So the palette was rebuilt to maximise the WORST pair rather than to
 * please the average one, searching OKLCH with each family's hue anchored to
 * its mnemonic (±14-18°) and lightness free to move across five steps.
 *
 * Result, measured the same way as the numbers above: **min ΔE 39,3** over the
 * thirteen drawn families — 2,5× the old worst case — with every L\* at or
 * above **55,7** and the tightest pairs now `culture`/`gendarmerie` 39,3 and
 * `restaurant`/`medecin` 39,3.
 *
 * ── ONE FAMILY IS DELIBERATELY QUIET ────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `restaurant` is 186 288 of the 445 380 points — 42 % of everything this layer
 * draws — and it is the one family given LOW chroma (#c37b7f, a dusty rose)
 * rather than a saturated hue of its own. At that share a bright colour is not
 * an identity, it is a wash: the mêlée test showed every other family drowning
 * in it. The fork and knife still name it, and it recedes so the twelve rarer
 * families can be found.
 *
 * ── COLLISIONS WITH THE NEIGHBOURS, AND WHY THEY ARE ACCEPTABLE ─────────────
 *
 * Against `medecins-fr`'s six practice hues the closest pairs are
 * `boulangerie`/`imagerie` at ΔE 10,2, `sport`/`femme-enfant` 11,2 and
 * `poste`/`specialiste` 12,9. Those would have been fatal under the old
 * regime and are not under this one: a croissant is not a trefoil, a dumbbell
 * is not an adult-and-child, an envelope is not a doctor's bag. That is the
 * whole point of moving recognition into the shape channel — the hue may
 * repeat across layers as long as the silhouette does not.

 * register per family**, which is why it refuses the BPE's entire education
 * domain to `schools-fr` and `sup-fr`, and says so in its own legend.
 *
 * THE WITHDRAWAL IS CONDITIONAL, WHICH IS WHY NOTHING IS REMOVED TO PAY FOR
 * IT. The cross-referencing audit (#128) recorded this as blocked on
 * `AMENITY_FAMILIES` being a CACHE KEY — the mesh stores a family by its INDEX
 * in that array, so deleting one silently renames every row of every cached
 * pack and forces a national rebuild. That is all true, and it is only the
 * price of deleting the family. Not drawing it while another layer does costs
 * nothing: the array is untouched, the packs are untouched, and a reader who

 * The families this layer no longer draws, and why each one left.
 *
 * ── `hopital` — WITHDRAWN, 2026-09-15, PERMANENTLY ─────────────────────────
 *
 * 2 211 FINESS establishments, moved to « Santé & secours » (`medecins-fr`),
 * which reads them from the same register and draws them with Maki's plain
 * cross beside the 64 232 practice addresses and the DREES accessibility
 * indicator. A hospital is not an everyday errand: a reader who wants one is
 * asking a health question, and every other answer to that question already
 * lives on the other row.
 *
 * NOTHING IS DELETED TO PAY FOR IT, and that is not timidity. `AMENITY_FAMILIES`
 * is the mesh's on-the-wire encoding — a tuple carries its family as an INDEX
 * into that array — so removing a member silently renumbers every row of every
 * cached pack and every share link that ever named one. The family keeps its
 * slot, its colour and its size; it simply is not drawn, exactly the mechanism
 * `AMENITIES_DEFERRED_FAMILY` already uses for `medecin`. The difference is
 * that this withdrawal is unconditional: there is no state in which this layer
 * draws a hospital again.
 *
 * ── `medecin` — DEFERRED, and only while somebody better is drawing it ──────
 *
 * See {@link AMENITIES_DEFERRED_FAMILY} below. Measured on 2026-09-15 against
 * the shipped registers: 74.6 % of the 30 213 BPE dots have a conventioned
 * practice address within 50 m and 91.5 % within 200 m, at a median distance of
 * 10 m where they match. So the two registers really are describing one
 * population, and the 8.5 % the CNAM does not carry is the price of drawing one
 * register per family rather than a blend of two — stated here so it is a
 * decision on the record rather than an omission.

/**
 * THE FAMILY FILTER — which of the thirteen are drawn right now.
 *
 * ── WHY IT EXISTS ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Thirteen families over one street is a legible map only if the reader wanted
 * all thirteen. Most of the time they want one: where is the nearest pharmacy,
 * which of these villages still has a bakery. The plates made the families
 * distinguishable; this makes them ASKABLE, and the asking surface is the key
 * itself — every row of the legend is the toggle for its own family, so the
 * mark a reader points at is the control they press.
 *
 * ── WHY THE FILTER IS NOT PURELY A DRAW-TIME MASK ───────────────────────────
 *
 * Because it would be a lie in a city, and the numbers say so. The `/sites`
 * route caps its answer at {@link MAX_RENDERED_SITES} rows and orders them
 * RAREST FAMILY FIRST, so the cap eats the common families: over inner Paris
 * the box holds 53 121 dots and the proxy answers 12 000. Ask that route for
 * "boulangeries only" as a post-filter and you get the boulangeries that
 * survived a cap computed over 53 121 restaurants — which is a sample of a
 * sample, presented as an answer.
 *
 * So the selection goes to the SERVER as `familles=`, and the cap applies to
 * what was asked for. Same reasoning in the maillage regime, one layer down:
 * `selectAmenitiesMesh` allocates a per-family budget so no family can be
 * squeezed off the map, and a filtered pick hands the whole budget to the
 * families that are on. Both are the same rule — a filter must change what is
 * COUNTED, not just what is painted.
 *
 * ── THE EMPTY SELECTION IS "ALL", NOT "NONE" ────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Turning off the last family restores every family instead of blanking the
 * map. A layer that is on and draws nothing is indistinguishable from a broken
 * one, and the reader's way of saying "nothing" is the row's own toggle.

   *                 is the one the share link carries and the « Tout » chip

   *   `basculer`  — TOGGLE. One family name, flipped against the current set.
   *                 This is what a key row sends, because a row is a switch and
   *                 a switch does not know what it is switching to.
   *
   * THEY WERE ONE KEY FOR ABOUT AN HOUR AND THAT WAS A BUG. Overloading
   * `familles` on "does it contain a comma" reads `boulangerie` as a toggle —
   * which is right when a reader presses the row, and catastrophic when a share
   * link restores a selection of exactly one family: the link says « draw only
   * bakeries », the layer starts from "all on", flips that one, and reopens
   * showing the twelve families the sender had turned off. A parameter that
   * means different things depending on how many items it happens to hold is
