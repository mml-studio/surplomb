/**
 * Géorisques — the state's own risk register, read from wherever the camera is
 * looking.
 *
 * WHAT MAKES THIS LAYER WORTH HAVING. The facts it draws are the same ones a
 * French seller is legally obliged to hand a buyer in the *état des risques* —
 * flood, clay shrinkage, seismicity, radon, industrial sites, polluted soil,
 * hazardous pipelines. That document normally arrives at the compromis, weeks
 * after the decision to buy. Read from a coordinate it arrives before the first
 * visit.
 *
 * ── THE DEFECT THIS VERSION EXISTS TO FIX ───────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Everything above was TRUE and none of it was ON SCREEN. Measured on a live
 * session over the Trocadéro on 2026-09-14, at 555 m: the layer drew one
 * line-art triangle for one classified installation, and drew nothing at all
 * for the eight hazards the same scan had already resolved. The verdicts were
 * fetched, projected, summarised into `getStats()` — and read by no surface of
 * the globe. The only place they rendered was `fiche.html`, which has no link
 * from the map. A reader who turned the layer on saw an empty frame and had no
 * way to learn it was not empty.
 *
 * Three changes answer it, and they are three different problems:
 *
 *   1. THE COMMUNE IS DRAWN, so the verdicts have a subject on screen.
 *   2. THE INSTALLATIONS GET A PLATE instead of a filament — see
 *      `hazardMarkerIcons.js`, which measures the old mark.
 *   3. THE VERDICTS ARE PUBLISHED TO THE KEY, where they are legible without
 *      opening a panel that ships collapsed.
 *
 * ── THE SECOND READING, OVER BASSUSSARRY AT 5 859 M ─────────────────────────
 *
 * Those three shipped, the layer was read again, and two things came back:
 * the installation mark is "beaucoup trop petite, quasiment invisible", and
 * the commune should be HIGHLIGHTED the way the régions are in the
 * electricity mix rather than merely outlined.
 *
 * THE MARK WAS 15.9 PIXELS AND THE CONSTANT SAID 24. Nobody had measured it
 * at the altitude it is read at, because the ramp hides the number: Cesium
 * interpolates a `NearFarScalar` against SQUARED distance and then raises
 * `t` to the power 0.2 (`czm_nearFarScalar`), so the FAR value owns nearly
 * the whole band. On the old ramp — 400/1.0 → 9 000/0.6 — t^0.2 is already
 * 0.38 at 900 m and 0.84 at 5 859 m, which is scale 0.66 and 15.9 px against
 * the 24 declared. So the repair is mostly at the FAR END (0.6 → 0.8), which
 * is the opposite of where a reader of `SIZE_ICPE_PX` would look, and
 * {@link markPixelsAtDistance} exists so the size on screen is checkable
 * rather than inferred.
 *
 * AND "LEGIBLE" IS NOT "FINDABLE". `hazardMarkerIcons.js` measured a plate
 * as still a plate at 10 px, and that measurement stands — it is about
 * reading a mark you have already found. Finding one over a photorealistic
 * mesh of roofs, gardens and parked cars is a different task with a much
 * higher floor, and 16 px was under it. The comparison that settled the new
 * size: a military installation, drawn by `militaryInstallations.js` over
 * the same mesh, is 25 px at that distance.
 *
 * ── THE COMMUNE IS NOW WASHED, AND WHAT KEEPS THAT HONEST ───────────────────
 *
 * The stroke alone lost its subject the moment the reader looked away from
 * it: a cyan line crossing a hillside is a line, and the eleven verdicts
 * keyed beside it are about the ground INSIDE it. So the interior is tinted,
 * and the one objection that mattered — a fill claims an extent — is
 * answered by what the fill is made of rather than by refusing to draw it.
 *
 * A HAZARD EXTENT ON THIS MAP IS WARM AND GRADED. The wash is the
 * interface’s own cyan at {@link COMMUNE_FILL_ALPHA}, flat, outside the
 * hazard ramp entirely, and cut to the commune’s own ring — the same
 * vertices the stroke draws. None of these hazards publishes a geometry
 * through this endpoint (`resultats_rapport_risque` answers "Risque
 * Existant" over a commune and over an address with nothing attached), so
 * nothing here could be read as "the water reaches this far" without also
 * being read as "and stops at the commune line", which no reader believes.
 * The key says what the shape is, the card says it, and the footnote says a
 * third time that the hazards themselves are not drawn.
 *
 * A SEVERITY RAMP WOULD STILL INVENT AN INDEX, and that argument is
 * untouched. Géorisques publishes no composite score, and counting hazards
 * is not one: twelve graded "faible" is not worse than one graded
 * "important", and colouring by the count would say it is. So the wash
 * carries ONE colour and says only "this is the commune the verdicts below
 * are about". The severity lives where the source put it — on each hazard,
 * in its own words, in the key.
 *
 * TWO COSTS COME WITH IT, both disclosed rather than hidden. The wash drapes
 * onto the photorealistic mesh, buildings included (`surfaceFillNotice.js`),
 * which is why `surfaceFill` is now declared and the shared drape note
 * mounts. And a ground-classified fill is PICKABLE — `delinquanceFrance.js`
 * selects a commune by clicking one — so a wash this size would have
 * swallowed every sibling layer’s ground click inside the commune. It is
 * registered as a pick DECORATION instead; see {@link drawCommuneWash}.
 *
 * ── WHAT IS DRAWN AND WHAT IS NOT ───────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Classified installations (ICPE) have coordinates, so they are drawn as
 * points. The hazards do not, and they are published to the key with
 * `color: null` — the manager's own "assessed, not mapped" swatch. That slot
 * exists precisely so a key can carry a fact the map could not draw without a
 * colour implying it did.
 *
 * ── THE TWO VERDICTS ARE KEPT APART ─────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `communeVerdict` and `addressVerdict` can disagree, and on the Paris 13e two
 * of them do. ICPE reads "Risque Concerne" for the commune and "Risque non
 * Concerne" for the address; retrait-gonflement des argiles reads "Risque
 * Existant - important" for the commune and "Risque non Connu" for the
 * address. That is the difference between "true anywhere around here" and
 * "depends on your street", the upstream computed it, and the key prints both
 * whenever they differ rather than picking one.

 *
 * ── ONE COLOUR FOR EVERY PART, WHICH IS ALSO A CESIUM CONSTRAINT ────────────
 *
 * A commune keeps up to three pieces, and all of them carry the identical
 * colour. That is the honest cartography (the module header's argument) and it
 * is separately what keeps a batched `GroundPrimitive` correct: Cesium's
 * classification pass keeps the first instance whose AXIS-ALIGNED BOUNDING
 * RECTANGLE contains a pixel, not the first whose polygon does, so instances
 * in one batch with DIFFERENT colours repaint each other along rectangle
 * edges. `qa-cadastre-highlight.mjs` carries the measurement. Identical
 * colours make the bug unobservable; a per-part tint would resurrect it.
 *
 * ── THE CLOSING VERTEX IS DROPPED, AND A RING MAY NOT HAVE ONE ─────────────
 *
 * The mirror image of the stroke below, which has to close itself BY HAND
 * because `fromDegreesArray` draws exactly the vertices it is given. A polygon
 * hierarchy is closed by definition, so a repeated final vertex is a
 * degenerate edge; Cesium would discard it, and dropping it here means the
 * geometry handed over is the geometry meant rather than the geometry that
 * survives a dedupe pass.
 *
 * Tested rather than assumed on both sides: `projectCommuneContours` keeps the
 * source ring's closing vertex, and `decimateCommuneRing` can stride it away —
 * which is the very failure the stroke's hand-closing exists for. So the last
