/**
 * @module panFeeds
 *
 * Pure catalog + viewport logic for the **Point d'Accès National** (PAN) to
 * French mobility data — `transport.data.gouv.fr`, the national access point
 * France operates under EU regulation 2017/1926.
 *
 * WHAT THIS SOURCE IS: a directory, not a feed. `GET /api/datasets` returns
 * every published mobility dataset with its resources; the ones this module
 * cares about are the `gtfs-rt` resources that declare the `vehicle_positions`
 * feature — roughly 150 live position feeds covering urban buses, trams,
 * metros, interurban coaches and school services across metropolitan France
 * and the DROM. Each resource is fetched directly for its own protobuf body.
 *
 * WHAT THE CATALOG DOES NOT GIVE: a bounding box. Coverage is published as a
 * NAME (`{type: 'epci', nom: 'Bordeaux Métropole'}`), never as geometry, so a
 * viewport-driven layer cannot ask the catalog "which feeds are on screen".
 * The footprint of every feed in `config/pan_gtfs_rt_feeds.json` is therefore
 * OBSERVED — the bounds of the vehicles the feed actually reported when
 * `scripts/build-pan-gtfs-rt-index.mjs` probed it — and the dev-server proxy
 * keeps learning bounds for feeds that were empty at build time. An observed
 * bbox is a measurement, not a coverage claim: a network's real service area
 * is at least as large as the box, and off-peak probes see less of it.
 *
 * Dependency-free and side-effect-free (same shape as `osmCameras.js`) so the
 * selection rules are unit-testable without a Vite server. The box geometry
 * itself lives in `viewportBox.js`, shared with the French shared-mobility
 * source, which asks the same question of a different catalog.
