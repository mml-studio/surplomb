/**
 * staleBuildRecovery.js — the one failure a toast cannot fix by being read.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. Staging rebuilds under open tabs. A page left open across a
 * deploy asks for hashed chunk names the origin no longer serves, so the first
 * toggle of any layer it had not already loaded fails with a 404 the browser
 * remembers for the tab's lifetime. Clicking again cannot work; reloading
 * always does. Until now the app said so in a toast that cleared itself after
 * two seconds — long enough to notice a message, too short to read a fourteen
 * word instruction and act on it (reported 2026-09-14, on the IRVE row).
 *
 * SO THE INSTRUCTION CARRIES ITSELF OUT. A stale build gets a countdown and a
 * reload, not a sentence the reader has to obey by hand. What this module owns
 * is the part that must never be improvised at the call site:
 *
 *  1. WHEN an automatic reload is allowed. A reload that fires on a failure the
 *     reload itself cannot cure is a reload loop, so one is spent per cooldown
 *     window and the next failure inside it only offers the button.
 *  2. WHAT the reloaded page comes back as. The layer the reader clicked is
 *     added to the share hash first, so the reload finishes the click instead
 *     of returning them to the state they were trying to leave.
 *
 * Everything here is pure. The UI owns the timer, the DOM and `location`.

/**
 * How long the reader gets to read the notice and stop the reload.

 * short enough that a reader who does nothing is not left staring at a broken
 * layer — the whole point is that doing nothing is the working path.
