 *
 * Where a childcare place is easy to find in France, and where it is not.
 *
 * ── Why this layer draws a RATE and not a register ──────────────────────────
 * There is no national open register of crèches. The question was asked and
 * measured before this file existed, and the answer is worth writing down so
 * nobody re-derives it:
 *
 *   · The CNAF — which HAS the list, behind monenfant.fr — publishes 210 open
 *     datasets and **not one of them is an establishment**. They are all
 *     aggregates: coverage rates and place counts by IRIS, QPV, commune, EPCI,
 *     département, région, national.
 *   · FINESS is not it either. Measured on the daily flux: 174 621
 *     establishments, of which **183** have a crèche-shaped name, and those
 *     are incidental (the crèche inside a rehabilitation centre). EAJE are
 *     authorised by the département's PMI, not by an ARS, so they are outside
 *     FINESS by construction.
 *   · INSEE's BPE has the right object — code `D502`, *Établissement d'accueil
 *     du jeune enfant* — but the only millésimes with an API behind them are
 *     2016 and **2021**, and 2021 holds 11 756 crèches against the ~15 000 the
 *     ONAPE counts.
 *   · Sirene has NAF 88.91A and 21 801 active companies, but filtering on the
 *     COMPANY's activity silently drops the public sector: `nature_juridique`
 *     7210 (commune) with APE 88.91A returns **zero rows**, while a municipal
 *     crèche is really there as an ESTABLISHMENT of the commune's SIREN
 *     (measured: COMMUNE DE SAINT-ANDRE-LES-VERGERS, company APE 84.11Z,
 *     establishment sign "CRECHE", establishment APE 88.91A).
 *
 * So this layer draws what IS published, honestly, rather than a register
 * assembled out of proxies: the CNAF's own *taux de couverture* — places of
 * formal childcare per 100 children under three — at the three scales the
 * CNAF publishes it.
 *
 * ── What the dataset IS ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Seven Opendatasoft datasets on **data.caf.fr**, Licence Ouverte 2.0,
 * published annually. Measured 2026-09-01, rentrée de référence **2023** (the
 * newest of the two years published, alongside 2022):
 *
 *   scale        taux            places          rows
 *   national     txcouv_pe_nat   —                  1   60,9 places / 100 enfants
 *   département  txcouv_pe_dep   nbpla_pe_dep     102
 *   EPCI         txcouv_pe_epci  nbpla_pe_epci  1 251
 *   commune      txcouv_pe_com   nbpla_pe_com   1 061
 *
 * The national figure cross-checks exactly against the ONAPE 2024 report
 * (60,9 places for 100 children under 3 in 2023), which is the reassurance
 * that this is the published indicator and not a re-derivation of it.
 *
 * ── Trap 1: the commune scale covers 1 061 communes, not 34 875 ─────────────
 * The CNAF publishes the communal breakdown **only for communes of more than
 * 10 000 inhabitants**. That is 1 061 of France's ~34 875 communes. It is a
 * city-scale detail, never a national mesh, and a choropleth built from it
 * would be 97% holes. So the two grains are drawn NESTED rather than side by
 * side: the EPCI territory — which does tile the whole country — is the wash,
 * and the 1 061 communes the CNAF breaks out are cut out of it and filled with
 * their own rate. Every card says which scale it is reporting.
 *
 * ── Trap 2: some rows are not areas, and they are not spelled alike ─────────
 * `numepci = "XX"`, `nomepci = "XX"` — a placeholder for the communes that
 * belong to no intercommunalité. It carries a REAL and extreme value (195,8),
 * which makes it the single most damaging row in the whole layer: left in, it
 * is the national maximum, it anchors any linear ramp, and it is drawn nowhere
 * because no contour matches `XX`. Dropped here. With it gone the real EPCI
 * range is **2,7** (CC de l'Est Guyanais) to **160,5** (CC Altitude 800),
 * median 62,9, and only 4 EPCI exceed 100.
 *
 * The département PLACES file carries the same idea spelled differently —
 * `numdep = "XXX"`, 15 places — so the test matches any run of X rather than
 * the literal string, which is the difference between catching one of the two
 * and catching both.
 *
 * ── Trap 3: `annee` is an int in six datasets and a DATE in the seventh ─────
 * `txcouv_pe_dep`, `_epci`, `_com` and the three `nbpla_*` publish `annee` as
 * `int`; `txcouv_pe_nat` publishes it as `date`. One `where=annee=2023` clause
 * cannot serve both — the national one answers HTTP 400. The national file is
 * two rows, so it is read whole and filtered here.
 *
 * ── Trap 4: a coverage rate is not a percentage and can exceed 100 ──────────
 * It counts PLACES per 100 resident children under three, so an area that
 * hosts more places than it has children — a commuter town, a tiny
 * denominator in the mountains — legitimately passes 100. Four EPCI do.
 * Nothing is clamped: clamping would turn a real finding into a ceiling.
 *
 * ── Trap 5: the published components do not sum exactly ─────────────────────
 * Every rate is published rounded to 0,1, so the five leaves (crèche PSU,
 * crèche hors PSU, préscolarisation, assistante maternelle, garde à domicile)
 * add up to the global rate only to within rounding: nationally
 * 19,9 + 3,6 + 3,3 + 31,9 + 2,2 = 60,9 exactly, but at other scales the sum
 * drifts by a tenth. The global figure is the published one and is never
 * recomputed from the parts.
 *
 * Dependency-free and side-effect-free (no Cesium, no DOM) so it runs
 * identically in the browser, in the Vite dev-server proxy, and under
 * `node --test`.

/**
 * ── Why the layer draws ground and not a dot ───────────────────────────────
 *
 * A coverage rate is a property of a TERRITORY. Drawn as a point it becomes a
 * property of a coordinate, and the coordinate is the area's administrative
 * centre — a field outside the seat commune for a rural intercommunalité, or
 * a spot in the 5th for a Métropole. Readers correctly refused to read that as
 * "this rate holds here and up to that ridge"; nothing on screen said where
 * "here" ended.
 *
 * So the areas are filled instead, from the only source that publishes French
 * communal limits openly: `geo.api.gouv.fr`, one département per call, which
 * is what `communeContours.js` wraps. Two consequences follow and both are
 * deliberate:
 *
 *   · An EPCI has NO contour of its own on that API. Its territory is drawn as
 *     its member communes, sharing one fill and carrying no internal outline,
 *     so the wash reads as one area rather than as a mosaic. Membership comes
 *     from `codeEpci`, which rides along with the geometry at no extra call.
 *   · The commune grain is only fetchable a département at a time, so the
 *     territory regime is entered LOW — see `PE_TERRITORY_ENTER_SPAN_DEG` in
 *     the render module. Above it the département choropleth answers, which is
 *     also a territory, only coarser. There is no zoom at which this layer
 *     puts a number on a spot again.
