/*
 * MEGAFIRE CLOCK — the cursor the Gironde reconstruction is read along.
 *
 * Pure: no Cesium, no DOM, no timers. The layer owns the tick and hands this
 * module a delta in seconds; this module owns what the cursor MEANS. That split
 * exists so the awkward half — what happens at the ends, what a step chip does
 * to playback, what "before the first frame" looks like — is unit-testable
 * without a viewer.
 *
 * ── WHY A CURSOR AND NOT FIVE BUTTONS ───────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The representation audit (#78, track 3) states the repo's own indictment: "le
 * temps n'est jamais sur la carte", with `idfm-network` as the single
 * exception and its hour chips as the mechanism to reuse. Chips alone would
 * have worked here — there are only five satellite frames — and they would have
 * been a worse answer, because the interesting quantity is not WHICH frame but
 * HOW FAST the gap between two of them was crossed. Between the frames of
 * 24 July 09:05 and 26 July 10:12 the fire took 19 082 hectares; a reader
 * pressing two buttons sees two numbers, a reader watching a cursor sees a
 * rate. The 9 524 FIRMS detections are what fills that gap, and they only mean
 * anything against a moving instant.
 *
 * So both are here: five chips that JUMP to a measured frame, and a cursor that
 * runs between them.
 *
 * ── THE ONE RULE THE DATA IMPOSES ───────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A perimeter is what a satellite SAW at an hour. It becomes true at its
 * acquisition instant and stays true until the next frame replaces it — it is
 * never interpolated. Tweening between two perimeters would invent hectares
 * nobody photographed, and the two-day gap in the middle of this event is
 * exactly where the invention would be largest and most convincing. The
 * hotspots interpolate nothing either: a detection exists at its acquisition
 * minute and not before.
 *
 * That is why {@link megafireClockState} returns `stepIndex` as a plain lookup
 * and never a fraction.
