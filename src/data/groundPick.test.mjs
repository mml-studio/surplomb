// Extracted from `cadastreParcels.js`, where it was the answer to "clicking one
// parcel lit up a shape somewhere else": ground-classification geometry is
// picked by whichever shadow volume the ray enters first, so a layer that
// already holds its polygons has to resolve the coordinate itself. Now two
// layers depend on the order these sources are tried, and the order is the
// whole of the correctness — each fallback is a WORSE answer than the one
// before it, and each is silently plausible.
