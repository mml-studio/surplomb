/**
 * éCO2mix — where French electricity actually comes from, right now.
 *
 * RTE publishes the national grid's state every 15 minutes: how much the
 * country is consuming, how much each generation filière is producing, the
 * carbon content of the kWh, and the commercial balance with each of the five
 * neighbouring markets. ODRÉ republishes it keyless under Licence Ouverte 2.0.
 *
 * ── Where the data comes from ───────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Through the `/api/energy-fr` proxy, which merges `eco2mix-national-tr` and
 * `eco2mix-regional-tr` into one ~4 KB document. RTE's own API carries the
 * same figures behind an OAuth2 account; ODRÉ needs no credential, so this
 * layer works on `git clone`. The upstream's sign conventions and type traps
 * are absorbed in `eco2mixFeed.js`, under test against captured payloads.
 *
 * ── What is drawn, and why THAT ─────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The national figures are a scalar time series with no geometry — a gauge,
 * not a map. So the globe shows the two things in this dataset that ARE
 * spatial:
 *
 * 1. **Which regions power France, and which draw on it**, as a PRISM per
 *    région: HEIGHT is |MW| of physical exchange, HUE is the SIGN of it.
 *    Each region's `ech_physiques` is its consumption minus its generation, so
 *    its sign says whether it is a net exporter or a net importer. Measured
 *    2026-08-27 07:45Z: Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes −7 781 MW and Normandie −6 712 MW
 *    against Île-de-France +6 478 MW. That asymmetry — the capital importing
 *    almost its entire load from the nuclear and hydro regions — is the
 *    structural fact about the French grid, and the prism is what makes it one
 *    image instead of a table.
 *
 * 2. **The five border flows**, as ARROWS pointing the way the power is
 *    going — Maki's `arrow`, CC0, not a shape this file draws. Each one leaves
 *    the FRENCH FRONTIER rather than the middle of the country, and its depth
 *    is the megawatts. See the flow section below.
 *
 * 3. **The five neighbouring market areas**, as OUTLINES. Never filled — see
 *    the honesty rules below.
 *
 * ── Why the flat fill had to go, and what replaced which channel ────────────
 *
 * This layer used to paint the régions in two flat colours whose ALPHA ramped
 * with |balance| / load. That is the fault CARTOGRAPHY B1 names in capitals:
 * `ech_physiques` is an ABSOLUTE quantity in megawatts, and « Représentation
 * d'une variable quantitative absolue en aplats de couleur — NOP !!!! ». A
 * colour fill can carry a rate; it cannot carry 7 781 MW.
 *
 * A3 — what each channel carried, and what it carries now:
 *
 *   HEIGHT  before: nothing. On a 3D globe, the axis was empty.
 *           now:    |MW|, linearly, from a common datum. The absolute
 *                   quantity finally sits on the one channel B1 allows it.
 *   HUE     before: the sign, plus (through alpha) a smear of the magnitude.
 *           now:    the SIGN ALONE — two franc hues, no gradient. The sign is
 *                   a BINARY QUALITATIVE fact, and B4 is explicit that colour
 *                   « est uniquement différenciatrice […] L'œil ne peut pas
 *                   établir d'ordre ». A diverging ramp would have invited the
 *                   eye to rank −7 781 against +6 478 by shade; the height
 *                   ranks them, and it ranks them correctly.
 *   ALPHA   before: |balance| / load, ramped 0.12 → 0.52 against a saturation
 *                   of 1.5. A second magnitude encoding on top of the hue —
 *                   A3 twice over, and unreadable on a translucent volume seen
 *                   through another translucent volume.
 *           now:    CONSTANT (`PRISM_BODY_ALPHA` / `PRISM_TOP_ALPHA`). The
 *                   ratio it carried is not lost: it is published in the
 *                   analyst record as `exchangeRatio`, where a number belongs.
 *
 * ── The arbitration: both prisms go UP ──────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A signed quantity invites the obvious figure — export UP, import DOWN, the
 * globe's surface as the zero line. It is semiologically stronger on paper and
 * it is not drawable here. Three reasons, in order of weight:
 *
 * 1. It would be INVISIBLE, not merely awkward. `Globe.translucency.enabled`
 *    is false by default (`Build/CesiumUnminified/index.js:208871`) and it is
 *    a scene-wide property no layer owns; with an opaque globe, a prism under
 *    the ellipsoid is occluded ENTIRELY, not partially. Terrain makes it
 *    worse: the ground sits above the ellipsoid nearly everywhere on land, so
 *    an Île-de-France prism going down would be buried before it started. And
 *    on the photorealistic stack the globe is hidden and the 3D tileset is the
 *    surface (`main.js:237`), which occludes just the same.
 * 2. Even if it rendered, the two halves would not be COMPARABLE. A signed bar
 *    chart works because its zero line is straight; here the datum is a
 *    sphere. Reading 7 781 MW up in Auvergne against 6 478 MW down in
 *    Île-de-France means comparing two lengths on opposite sides of a curved,
 *    foreshortened limb — the exact measurement the prism exists to make easy.
 * 3. The direction is already carried, losslessly, by the one variable
 *    perspective does not distort (F4): the hue. Spending geometry on a fact
 *    the colour states exactly, in order to lose the magnitude comparison, is
 *    a bad trade. The height ruler stays single and shared: every prism starts
 *    at `PRISM_BASE_HEIGHT_M` = 0 and grows the same way, so the tops are
 *    comparable across all twelve régions, and the pair of hues says which way
 *    the power flows.
 *
 * What this costs, plainly: the picture no longer looks like a balance sheet,
 * and a reader who ignores colour sees only "who moves the most power". The
 * label at the top of every prism spells the verb (EXPORTE / IMPORTE) and the
 * megawatts, so colour is never the sole carrier.
 *
 * ── One mark per measurement: the dissolve ─────────────────────────────────
 *
 * This layer measures TWELVE régions. It used to draw NINETY-SIX prisms.
 *
 * The old note here argued that the seams between the eight départements of
 * Île-de-France were « the truth of the geometry, not twelve readings ». That
 * was true about the polygons and false about the picture, and the first
 * person to look at the layer proved it in one sentence: « chaque département
 * a une hauteur qui est représentative du niveau de puissance qu'il exporte
 * […] on n'arrive pas à distinguer un département par rapport à un autre » —
 * a reading of DEPARTMENTAL measurements, on a map where no département is
 * measured, followed by the complaint that they all look the same. They looked
 * the same because they ARE the same. Ninety-six marks for twelve readings is
 * A1 at the level of the mark itself: the unit the eye counts has to be the
 * unit that was measured.
 *
 * So the départements are dissolved into their région before anything is
 * drawn (`polygonDissolve.js`), and each région gets ONE mark. Measured on the
 * bundled file: **96 polygons, 118 rings and 14 335 vertices** became **13
 * marks** — twelve prisms and Corse — because **4 253 shared segments**
 * cancelled, leaving 31 rings and 5 742 vertices in all. Île-de-France alone
 * cancelled 139 of them.
 *
 * Two consequences are stated rather than hidden:
 *
 * • **Islands under {@link PRISM_MIN_RING_AREA_DEG2} carry no prism.** Ré,
 *   Oléron, Belle-Île, Noirmoutier, Yeu, Porquerolles. A 78 km column standing
 *   on a 23 km² island is a needle that measures its région and looks like it
 *   measures the island. They keep their outline on the ground and lose the
 *   volume. Corse is far above the threshold and is unaffected — its absence
 *   from the map is a data fact, not a geometric one.
 * • **The prism does not stand on the whole région.** See the next section.
 *
 * ── Why the footprint is pulled in, and what pays for it ────────────────────
 *
 * Twelve dissolved régions tile France with no gap. Extruded, at any oblique
 * angle, they compose into a single continuous mesa: the near ones occlude the
 * far ones, and where two neighbours run at similar heights the eye reads one
 * plateau across a border it cannot see. Twelve marks that touch are not
 * twelve marks.
 *
 * The prism therefore stands on the région's footprint scaled to
 * {@link PRISM_FOOTPRINT_SCALE} about its own centroid, which opens a canyon
 * between every pair of neighbours. Measured, mean pull-back per région: 6.3 km
 * for Île-de-France, 17.2 km for Nouvelle-Aquitaine, 5.8 km for Corse — so a
 * canyon of 12 to 34 km between two neighbours, ~24 px at the ~1 500 km
 * national altitude this layer's calibration section uses. Each volume becomes
 * an object with a silhouette on both sides.
 *
 * A uniform scale, not an inward buffer, and the reason is in
 * `polygonDissolve.js`: a buffer self-intersects wherever a shape is narrower
 * than twice the offset (the Cotentin, the Gironde, the Alpine valleys) and a
 * scale about an interior point cannot self-intersect at all.
 *
 * What it costs, plainly: **the base of a prism is no longer exactly where the
 * région ends.** That is a real loss and it is paid for, not waved away — the
 * TRUE perimeter of every région is drawn as a line clamped to the ground,
 * under the prism it belongs to, in the same colour. The reader who wants to
 * know where Normandie stops looks at the line, which is exact; the reader who
 * wants to compare two heights looks at the volumes, which no longer merge.
 * The legend used to say both in French; it says two rows now, and
 * {@link energyPrismLegend} records what that deliberately stopped telling
 * anyone.
 *
 * ── The flow is a ready-made arrow, and its length is not a variable ───────
 *
 * Two drawings came before this one and both were this file's own. The first
 * was a Cesium `PolylineArrowMaterialProperty`, a tapering stroke 3 to 10
 * SCREEN PIXELS wide: 366 MW from Spain came out at 3.85 px next to a 78 km
 * prism, and the reader's verdict was « quasi illisible […] vraiment quelque
 * chose de ridicule ». The second was a tube swept along a great circle and
 * terminated by a cone, in metres this time — and the same reader's verdict on
 * it was « moches ».
 *
 * They were right twice, and the second time it was not the size. An eight-
 * sided `polylineVolume` with `outline: true` draws its eight longitudinal
 * edges, so 340 km of shaft read as corrugated hose; and a cone is a triangle
 * only from side-on, which is one of the camera pitches this layer is read at.
 *
 * The mark is now **Maki's `arrow`** — CC0, authored for maps, vendored path-
 * verbatim in `mapIcons.js` — drawn as ONE billboard. The constants section
 * around {@link ARROW_LENGTH_M} carries the arithmetic; the three things worth
 * knowing here are:
 *
 * • **It wears the prism's clothes, not the icon packs'.** Every other
 *   billboard in this project is white line-art over a black halo. This one is
 *   a translucent body at {@link PRISM_BODY_ALPHA} under a near-opaque edge at
 *   {@link PRISM_TOP_ALPHA} — the same two numbers, imported and not retyped,
 *   that the prism and the région perimeter already use. Asked for in those
 *   words: « réutilise cet effet de transparence qui est appliqué sur le
 *   traçage des formes des régions ». {@link borderArrowGlyph} builds it.
 *
 * • **A screen width still fights the rest of the layer**, and the arrow does
 *   not use one: `sizeInMeters` puts it in metres like every prism. Its depth
 *   ramps with |MW| and saturates at the same 3 000 MW the pixel stroke used.
 *   At the 1.21 km/px of the reference altitude the shaft runs 15 px to 29 px
 *   and the head 80 px to 161 px, against 3.85 px.
 *
 * • **Length is one constant for all five, and the arrow STRADDLES its
 *   frontier.** The tube clamped length to `[170 km, 340 km]`, which left a
 *   2:1 ratio between Switzerland and Spain that the data never wrote. Every
 *   arrow is now 300 km: 190 km abroad and 110 km back into France. Both
 *   halves are measured ceilings and both are recorded at
 *   {@link ARROW_ABROAD_M} — the first is what keeps each far end inside the
 *   market it names, the second is what keeps the Swiss and German arrows from
 *   fusing into one orange knot over Grand Est.
 *
 * • **Sense survives the camera.** A billboard faces the viewer, and its
 *   course is re-projected every frame by `iconOrientation.js` — the module
 *   the flight and AIS layers already trust for exactly this. The arrow is the
 *   same arrow from overhead and from a shallow oblique. The cone carried the
 *   sense and was the first thing the camera took away.
 *
 * **The bow is gone, and with it an F7(b) exemption this file used to have to
 * argue for.** The tube rose 20–55 km because a tube lying on the ground
 * buries its own lower half, and that height sat inside the prism ruler's own
 * amplitude. A billboard has no lower half: it rides at one constant altitude
 * that ramps with nothing and means nothing.
 *
 * ── The neighbours are delimited, and never filled ──────────────────────────
 *
 * `ech_comm_espagne` is 500 MW and a country name. Until now the country
 * itself was nowhere on the globe: an arrow pointed off the frame and the
 * reader supplied Spain from memory. The five market areas are now outlined
 * from `local_data/energy_market_areas/` (Natural Earth, public domain,
 * 674 points for the five).
 *
 * They are drawn as a LINE and the inside is left empty, deliberately, and it
 * is the same rule as everywhere else in this layer: a filled polygon is what
 * a MEASUREMENT looks like here, and nothing inside Spain was measured. The
 * three marks are therefore three claims —
 *
 *     prism, filled            → measured, and this tall
 *     flat footprint, striped  → known, and not published (Corse)
 *     outline, empty           → this is the counterparty, and it is all we
 *                                know about it
 *
 * — and the outline takes the flow's colour, so a market France is exporting
 * to is teal on the arc AND on its own border. A market whose flow is under
 * the deadband is drawn slate: still a neighbour, nothing crossing.
 *
 * Two honesty notes travel with the file and are repeated in its `SOURCE.md`:
 * the Spanish outline is the peninsular MARKET, so the Balearics and the
 * Canaries are absent; the British one is the GB bidding zone, so Northern
 * Ireland is absent. Germany and Belgium share one outline because they share
 * one field.
 *
 * ── Calibration, frozen (C1) ────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `ENERGY_PRISM_DOMAIN_MAX_MW` = 12 000 MW ↔ 120 km, a literal measured once
 * and published here, never re-derived from the poll in hand. On the captured
 * snapshot the twelve régions run 7 781 → 1 544 MW, i.e. a dynamic range of
 * 1 : 5.0 — far under the 1 : 30 where `choroplethPrism` says a square-root
 * ruler starts earning its keep — and the smallest of them stands at 15.4 km,
 * 3.9× the 4 km floor. So `'linear'` here is not a default taken on trust: no
 * région is floored, and « deux fois plus haut vaut deux fois plus » is true
 * of every pair on the map.
 *
 * At the ~1 500 km national altitude (`prismApparentPx`, 1600 × 1000):
 *
 *     Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes  7 781 MW → 77.8 km →  74.9 px
 *     Normandie             6 712 MW → 67.1 km →  64.6 px
 *     Île-de-France         6 478 MW → 64.8 km →  62.3 px
 *     Bretagne              1 544 MW → 15.4 km →  14.9 px
 *
 * The headroom is deliberate. Setting the domain at the observed maximum would
 * clip the leader on the first cold day: Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes alone carries
 * ~13.5 GW of nuclear plus the Rhône hydro chain against a ~6.5 GW load, and
 * Normandie ~10.4 GW against ~2.6 GW. 12 000 MW sits above the largest balance
 * that fleet can produce while still spending 65 % of the ruler on the régions
 * that exist. A value above it is CLIPPED and counted in `getStats()` rather
 * than silently rescaling the whole country. It used to be declared in the
 * legend too (A5); the legend is two rows now, by instruction, and
 * {@link energyPrismLegend} carries the list of what that cost.
 *
 * ── Honesty rules this layer is built around ────────────────────────────────
 *
 * • **The régions are painted, and the DÉPARTEMENTS are only the source.**
 *   There are no bundled région polygons; the 96 département shapes already
 *   carried for Vigilance are grouped by région and DISSOLVED into one outline
 *   apiece before anything is drawn. No département survives into the scene,
 *   no label ever names one — a prism looks far more like a measured unit than
 *   a flat fill ever did, and the unit has to be the one that was measured.
 *   See the dissolve section above.
 *
 * • **Corse gets a sign of its own, and it is not a short prism.** éCO2mix
 *   régional covers 12 metropolitan regions; Corsica runs on its own system
 *   and is absent upstream. 2A and 2B are therefore drawn FLAT AND STRIPED —
 *   a motif, not a tint, because on a photorealistic globe no hue is neutral
 *   and a pattern is what survives the NVG and FLIR passes (D3). Under the old
 *   flat regime they were simply hidden, which made "not published" look
 *   exactly like "nothing here"; a prism regime cannot afford that, because a
 *   missing prism and a zero-height prism are one pixel apart. The three
 *   states are now distinct marks (A1): striped flat footprint = unmeasured,
 *   opaque flat footprint = measured at zero, prism ≥ 4 km = measured.
 *
 * • **Only the flat marks are ground-classified.** An extruded polygon does
 *   not classify: `GroundGeometryUpdater._isOnTerrain` returns false as soon
 *   as `extrudedHeight` is defined (`index.js:148334-148336`), so
 *   `polygon.classificationType` would be read and then ignored in silence.
 *   The map-stack listener therefore still runs — the striped footprint, the
 *   measured-zero footprint, the région perimeters and the market outlines ARE
 *   clamped, and they still have to drape on whichever surface is active — but
 *   it skips every prism instead of pretending. Two things
 *   come free with the change: the batched-`GroundPrimitive` bug that colours
 *   an instance by its bounding rectangle cannot apply to a geometry that
 *   classifies nothing; and the outline Cesium force-disables on terrain
 *   (`index.js:61110-61113`) becomes legal, which is what draws the top edge
 *   the height is read against. `surfaceFill` is consequently false: no
 *   thematic hue climbs a façade here any more (F4).
 *
 * • **An unmeasured région is NAMED, not just striped.** Three things put a
 *   région in that state — Corse, which is never published; a published null;
 *   and a région the feed drops for a poll, which happens because éCO2mix
 *   publishes per-région and keeps the newest row each has. All three get the
 *   same mark, so all three get the same count, and that count is taken from
 *   the THIRTEEN known régions rather than from the rows the payload carried.
 *   Counting the rows is what let Normandie vanish on the 2026-09-10 15:04Z
 *   poll: twelve prisms, two striped shapes, and a legend that said « non
 *   publié 1 ». The label is the other half — an anonymous grey shape made the
 *   reader work out which région was missing from the coastline.
 *
 * • **A zero flow is drawn as nothing.** A border at 0 MW is not a thin arc,
 *   it is no arc — the same "absence is not a colour" rule the Vigilance layer
 *   established for level vert.
 *
 * • **The arcs leave the frontier, and they are still not cables.** They used
 *   to start at a single point in the middle of France — all five of them,
 *   from Berry, which drew a country that trades out of its own centre of
 *   gravity. Each arc now leaves the point of the FRENCH FRONTIER nearest its
 *   market's reference point, computed from the same dissolved geometry
 *   (`frontierAnchors`), and runs a fixed 175 km on that BEARING — it aims at
 *   the reference point and does not travel to it. Measured, with Corsica
 *   excluded from the search so
 *   the Italian arc does not leave from Bonifacio: Angleterre 1.58 E / 50.87 N
 *   (Gris-Nez), Espagne 1.44 W / 43.05 N (Pays basque), Italie 7.71 E /
 *   44.07 N (Alpes-Maritimes), Suisse 7.42 E / 47.45 N (Sundgau),
 *   Allemagne + Belgique 6.47 E / 49.46 N (Moselle).
 *
 *   That those five land where real interconnections land is a consequence and
 *   NOT a claim: `ech_comm_*` is a commercial nomination between two market
 *   areas and carries no routing at all. The frontier point is a geometric
 *   fact about a border, the far end is a BEARING toward a reference point
 *   inside a country, and neither is a converter station.
 *   `ech_comm_allemagne_belgique` is one field for two countries and stays one
 *   arc, labelled with both.
 *
 * • **Commercial ≠ physical.** The five commercial balances do not sum to
 *   `ech_physiques` (measured: −2 893 against −3 633 MW). The arcs show the
 *   commercial figures and say so; the national net shown in `getStats()` is
 *   the physical one and is labelled separately.
 *
 * • **Carbon intensity is national only.** RTE publishes no regional CO₂
 *   content, so none is painted per region — only reported for France.

 * The border flow is a READY-MADE ARROW, not a shape this file builds.
 *
 * It was, in order: a `PolylineArrowMaterialProperty` 3.85 px wide, which the
 * first reader called « quasi illisible […] vraiment quelque chose de
 * ridicule »; then a tube swept along a great circle and terminated by a cone,
 * which the same reader called « moches ». The second verdict is the one worth
 * reading carefully, because the geometry was correct and it still looked
 * wrong:
 *
 * • **An eight-sided `polylineVolume` with `outline: true` draws its eight
 *   longitudinal edges.** Over 340 km of bowed tube that is eight parallel
 *   stripes running the length of the mark — the silhouette the outline was
 *   there to protect became corrugated hose.
 * • **A cone is a blob from every angle but one.** Seen side-on it is a
 *   triangle; seen at any other camera pitch it is an ellipse with a bump, and
 *   the layer draws at every camera pitch.
 *
 * The mark is now Maki's `arrow`, CC0, vendored in `mapIcons.js` and drawn as a
 * single billboard. Nothing here draws an arrow any more, which is the point:
 * the artwork was authored for maps by people who draw arrows, and this file
 * was inventing one out of primitives that happen to exist in Cesium.
 *
 * ── What the billboard buys, beyond looking like an arrow ───────────────────
 *
 * **Sense survives the camera.** A billboard faces the viewer, and
 * {@link borderArrowRotation} re-projects the flow's course every frame
 * through `iconOrientation.js`. The cone was the mark that carried the sense
 * and it was the first thing lost when the camera dropped.
 *
 * **The bow is gone, and with it an F7(b) exemption.** The old glyph rose 20 to
 * 55 km because a tube sitting on the ground buries its own lower half; that
 * height was inside the prism ruler's amplitude and had to be argued for in the
 * legend. A billboard has no lower half. It rides at a single constant
 * {@link ARROW_ALTITUDE_M} and measures nothing at all.
 *
 * ── One length for all five, at last ────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Length has never been a variable this layer wrote, and it is now not a
 * variable at all. The previous glyph clamped it to `[170 km, 340 km]`, which
 * left a 2:1 ratio between the Swiss mark and the Spanish one that no reader
 * could be blamed for reading as data.
 *
 * {@link ARROW_LENGTH_M} is a single constant, and 175 km is not a round
 * number picked by eye — it is the largest one that keeps every flow pointing
 * at its own market. Measured against the bundled outlines, from each market's
 * frontier point along the great circle to its reference point:
 *
 *     suisse              the reference point is 94 km away; the glyph is
 *                         still inside Switzerland at 175 km and leaves it at
 *                         ~195 km. THIS is the binding constraint.
 *     allemagne_belgique  117 km away, inside at 175 km.
 *     angleterre          289 km away, inside.
 *     espagne             347 km away, inside.
 *     italie              411 km away, and the one that is NOT inside: the
 *                         great circle from the Alpine frontier to central
 *                         Italy crosses the Ligurian Sea, so at 175 km the
 *                         glyph is over water off Genoa. It is on the exact
 *                         bearing of its market, it is four times nearer the
 *                         Italian reference point than any other, and the
 *                         Italian outline is drawn in its colour. Stated here
 *                         rather than fixed by lengthening the glyph, which
 *                         would only move the problem onto Switzerland.
 *
 * ── Thickness is still the only thing the data moves ────────────────────────
 *
 * The billboard is scaled ANISOTROPICALLY: {@link ARROW_LENGTH_M} across, and
 * a depth that ramps with |MW| and saturates at {@link ARC_SATURATION_MW}.
 * Scaling a rectangle in image space is rigid — the rotation is applied to the
 * quad's corners, not to the texture — so the head keeps its 5.6:1 ratio to the
 * shaft at every flow. What changes is the arrow's ASPECT: a weak border draws
 * a long thin arrow, a saturated one draws the artwork at its own proportions.
 *
 * {@link ARROW_DEPTH_MAX_M} is deliberately equal to {@link ARROW_LENGTH_M}, so
 * the strongest flow on the map is the only one drawn undistorted. Anything
 * above it would stretch Maki's arrow TALLER than it is long, which is the one
 * direction that stops looking like an arrow.
 *
 * What that is worth, at the 1.21 km/px of the reference altitude: the shaft
 * runs 10.6 km to 20.6 km, which is 9 px to 17 px, and the head 58 km to
 * 113 km, 48 px to 94 px. Against 3.85 px.

 *
 * • **110 km inland** is the largest reach that keeps the Swiss and the

 *   into one orange knot. At 110 km they sit head to head across Grand Est

 * when an end is off-screen or behind the camera.

 * A layer inventing its own screen-space convention next to a module written
 * for it is how a mark ends up pointing at the wrong country.
 *
 * The previous value is passed through twice over: `screenProjectedRotation`
