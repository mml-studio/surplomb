/**
 * The on-disk contract for the local carroyage pack, in one place.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE IS SEPARATE FROM THE SCRIPT THAT WRITES IT. Two programs have
 * to agree about this layout — `scripts/build-filosofi-2021-pack.mjs`, which
 * writes it, and the Vite proxy, which reads it — and the script carries a
 * `#!/usr/bin/env node` shebang that esbuild refuses to bundle. Importing the
 * script from the config was a build failure, not a style problem.
 *
 * AND IT LIVES UNDER `scripts/`, not `src/`, because it imports `node:path`.
 * Everything in `src/` is bundled for the browser and a boundary test refuses a
 * Node core import there — correctly: this module is read by the proxy and by a
 * build script, and never by a page.
 *
 * WHAT THE PACK IS FOR. INSEE published the 2021 carroyage on 2026-02-12; the
 * Géoplateforme WFS the app relays is still on 2019 (measured 2026-09-03 by cell
 * count: 2 314 836 served, against 2 313 783 documented for 2019 and 2 324 577
 * for 2021). The pack is how a deployment can draw the newer millésime without
 * waiting for the relay — and it is OPTIONAL. A clone with no pack draws 2019
 * and says 2019, because the vintage travels with every answer instead of being
 * a constant the client assumes.
 *

 * Shard side, in metres of EPSG:3035.
 *
 * 50 000 m is a whole number of cells at BOTH resolutions — 250 of 200 m and 50
 * of 1 km — so a shard key is exact integer arithmetic on either grid rather
 * than a rounding. (51 200 was tried first, for being 256 fine cells; it is
 * 51.2 coarse ones, and a constant that divides one grid and not the other is a
 * trap left for whoever adds the third.) It puts roughly 5 000 inhabited cells
 * in a shard over a city and a handful over the Massif Central, so a city
 * viewport reads two or three files and a rural one reads a nearly empty one.

 * Réunion in 2975 (UTM 40 S). The app inverts all three, so the pack can hold
 * all three — but the GRID IS PART OF A CELL'S IDENTITY, because two cells in
 * two territories can carry the same northing and easting and mean different
