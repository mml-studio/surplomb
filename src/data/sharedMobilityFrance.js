/**
 * @module sharedMobilityFrance
 *
 * French shared mobility — the bikes, e-bikes, scooters, mopeds and shared
 * cars waiting to be picked up, from the GBFS feeds published on the Point
 * d'Accès National (`transport.data.gouv.fr`).
 *
 * WHAT THIS IS, AND WHAT IT IS NOT. This is an INVENTORY, not a track. The
 * GBFS spec is explicit: *"Vehicles that are part of an active rental MUST NOT
 * appear in this feed."* A vehicle being ridden is invisible — it disappears
 * when unlocked and reappears wherever it is parked. So nothing here glides
 * the way a bus does in `transitFrance.js`; the fleet BLINKS, and pretending
 * otherwise by interpolating between two sightings would be inventing a
 * journey that the feed deliberately does not publish.
 *
 * HOW IT AVOIDS DRAWING THE SAME THING TWICE. Three separate redundancies are
 * resolved before a point reaches the screen, all of them measured rather than
 * assumed (see `gbfsFeeds.js` and `scripts/build-gbfs-fr-index.mjs`):
 *
 *   1. The catalog lists one system many times — 165 resources, 135 distinct
 *      systems. Duplicates are identified by the SET OF PLACES a system
 *      reports, which survives different URLs, hosts and GBFS versions.
 *   2. Four systems are already drawn by `bikeshare.js` (Vélib', Vélo'v,
 *      vélÔToulouse, Le Vélo TBM) and are excluded here rather than doubled.
 *   3. Free-floating operators republish the city's own parking bays as their
 *      "stations" — 26,259 rows over Paris alone, near-identical between
 *      operators. Those are not drawn per operator; the fleet is.
 *   4. An operator alone in its city escapes rule 3 and draws its whole bay
 *      map, most of it empty: Pony put 447 empty bays over Biarritz against 94
 *      holding a bike. A VIRTUAL bay with a published zero is not drawn — it
 *      is a polygon, not infrastructure — while an empty physical dock always
 *      is (`isEmptyVirtualBay`). Both counts are declared in the control row.
 *
 * NAMES ARE CHECKED AGAINST THEIR OWN KEY. Ten Pony systems publish
 * `station_id` in the `name` field — 4,959 rows nationwide — which filled a
 * whole city with `basque_country_parking` repeated. `gbfsFeeds.js` refuses
 * the echo, and a nameless dot is called by its operator instead.
 *
 * FRESHNESS IS UNEVEN AND SAID SO. Measured 2026-08-26: Lime republishes every
 * ~50 s, Dott's median fix is 8 minutes old with a tail past 2 hours. The card
 * prints the age of the vehicle's own last report, never the age of the poll.

//
// TWO CHANNELS, TWO QUESTIONS. A viewport over Paris holds Lime, Dott and Voi
// in the same streets, publishing bikes, e-bikes, scooters and mopeds side by
// side. Those are independent facts, so they get independent channels:
//
//   SHAPE  — WHAT it is.  A vehicle wears its own silhouette
//            (`sharedMobilityIcons.js`); a station is a dot, because a place
//            is not a vehicle and should not be drawn as one.
//   COLOUR — WHO runs it. The operator's hue (`mobilityOperators.js`) is the
//            body of a vehicle and the RING of a station.
//
// A station keeps its FILL for availability, which is the reading someone acts
// on and which no vehicle has: how full it is. So the ring, not the fill,
// carries the operator there — the alternative was to spend the fill on the
// operator and lose the only actionable number the layer publishes.

 *
 * Cesium does NOT interpolate this linearly. `czm_nearFarScalar` works on
 * SQUARED distance and then takes `pow(t, 0.2)`, so the falloff is violently
 * front-loaded: on the old ramp a mark was already down to 15.9 px at 2 km and
 * to 19.5 px — its own maximum — only below ~600 m. Holding the plate at full
 * size across the whole street-level band costs nothing legible (it was already
 * at its maximum down there) and is what makes a badge band exist at all.
 *
 * The WIDE end is deliberately unchanged: 20 × 0.34 = 6.8 px is exactly what

 *
 * A city viewport holds bikes, e-bikes, trottinettes, scooters and shared cars
 * in the same streets, and the reader who came for one of those reads the
 * other four as noise. The shape channel already says which is which; these
 * two chips are what let someone act on it.
 *
 * A PARTITION, NOT TWO OVERLAPPING SETS. Every object belongs to exactly one
 * side, so pressing one chip and then the other shows the whole fleet with
 * nothing invisible under both. That is the property that makes the pair
 * trustworthy, and it is why `other` — a form factor GBFS declines to name —
 * sits with the rest rather than nowhere.
 *
 * A VAE IS A BIKE. `vehicleKindFromType()` splits `bicycle` by propulsion, so
 * `bike` and `ebike` are the same silhouette on two power sources; a chip
 * labelled "Vélos" that hid every Vélib' électrique would be lying about its
 * own name. The tooltip says both are in there.
 *
 * There is no third "everything" chip: pressing the lit one releases the
 * filter, and a row with neither lit already reads as unfiltered. The strip
 * this shares with the fusion chips is a control strip, not a second list of
 * names, and a third chip would have spent a quarter of it saying "no".
