/**
 * Le dossier de comparables — ce que le conseiller a choisi, et rien d'autre.
 *
 * WHAT THIS IS, AND WHY IT IS NOT A FEED. Every other layer in this repository
 * asks a public service a question. This one asks the reader. It holds one
 * property under study and the comparables retained against it, half of them
 * picked out of DVF and half of them keyed in from listings the advisor is
 * looking at — and it computes what a valuation note computes: a price per
 * square metre per comparable, a median, a spread, and the gap between what is
 * asked and what is paid.
 *
 * WHY A HUMAN SELECTION IS THE PRODUCT AND NOT A SHORTCUT. The Cityscan
 * teardown (#99) records the finding this module is built on: Cityscan's own public
 * translation file names the source of its comparables, and it is
 * « Sélection de votre conseiller(ère) parmi les portails d'annonces ». Their
 * comparables module holds no listing database. It holds a screen where the
 * advisor chooses. The state of the art of the competitor is a selection
 * interface, so a selection interface is what this is.
 *
 * THE ROUTE THIS MODULE REFUSES TO TAKE. Building a national listing base by
 * extraction is the one thing in that triage that is genuinely closed, and the
 * price of forcing it is published: Cass. 1re civ., 5 oct. 2022 n° 21-16.307
 * (leboncoin's listings are a protected sub-base in their own right),
 * Cass. 1re civ., 15 oct. 2025 n° 23-23.167 (verification investments count),
 * CA Versailles, 14 avr. 2026 n° 24/05370 (200 000 €, plus 500 € per listing
 * under penalty). The text-and-data-mining exception does not cover it either:
 * L122-5-3 and L342-3 CPI permit copies made FOR mining, subject to the
 * rightsholder's opt-out, and never the reuse of a substantial part.
 *
 * The consequence is written into the code and not only into a document:
 * {@link safeListingUrl} keeps a listing's address as a LINK, and nothing in
 * this repository ever requests it. The URL is there so a reader can open the
 * page they already had open; it is never a fetch target, and the panel says so
 * out loud.
 *
 * ── THE ONE THING THIS DOES THAT THE COMPETITOR DOES NOT ───────────────────
 *
 * A listing price and a transaction price are not the same measurement, and a
 * valuation note that medians them together says so nowhere. Doctrine A1 —
 * never the same sign for a measured value and a default — extends to this
 * cleanly: an asking price is an INTENTION and a mutation is an OBSERVATION,
 * so they are counted apart, drawn apart, and the difference between the two
 * medians is printed as its own line — with both sample sizes beside it, and
 * with the sentence that refuses the words a reader would otherwise supply:
 * it is not a negotiation margin. It is the distance between what is being
 * asked for one set of properties and what was paid for another, at another
 * time, with no temporal adjustment applied to either.
 *
 * WHAT IS REFUSED, AND COUNTED WHILE BEING REFUSED (A5). No ratio without a
 * surface. No ratio recomputed for a DVF mutation that bought more than one
 * dwelling — `dvfFeed.js` already measured what that arithmetic produces
 * (€1.28 million per square metre for a 179-lot building), so the register's
 * own null is carried through rather than second-guessed. No ratio outside
 * {@link PRIX_M2_BOUNDS}, because the failure mode of typing is a keystroke,
 * and one 20 000 000 €/m² typo moves a median more than every honest entry in
 * the dossier. Every one of those exclusions is counted and printed.
 *
 * WHAT LEAVES THE BROWSER, EXACTLY. The dossier does not: it lives in
 * `localStorage`, moves by file, and there is no account, no backend and no
 * upload — which is why the share link carries the layer's on/off state and
 * nothing else (see `layerState.js`). But « rien ne quitte le navigateur » was
 * too round a sentence to be true, and an adversarial pass said so: THREE
 * things do go out, and each is named on screen rather than in a comment.
 * The ADDRESS a reader types goes to `/api/geocode` and to the BAN reverse
 * endpoint, because turning an address into a coordinate is what those are
 * for. The SCAN POINT goes to `/api/dvf`. No price, no surface, no listing
 * link and no dossier ever does. The distinction matters: an address is the
 * one field a client would recognise, and a reader deserves the precise
 * sentence rather than the flattering one.
