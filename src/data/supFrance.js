/**
 * @module supFrance
 *
 * Where France's 2.96 million students actually are — the layer that starts
 * where `schoolsFrance.js` stops.
 *
 * The source is the MESR's *Effectifs d'étudiants inscrits — détail par
 * établissements* (Licence Ouverte 2.0), completed with the ministry's
 * geolocated Parcoursup cartography for the establishments the register cannot
 * place. `supFeed.js` holds the reading of both files and every trap in them;
 * `supDepartements.js` holds the national fold; this file is the rendering.
 *
 * ── Two regimes, not three, and that is the interesting part ────────────────
 * `schools-fr` and `irve-fr` both need a middle "maillage" regime, because
 * 68 158 schools and 39 579 charge points cannot be sent to a browser with
 * their names on and cannot be drawn at once if they were. This register is
 * 6 914 sites. The complete pack — every site with its name, band, enrolment,
 * cycle mix, campus count, formation offer and website — measures **0.62 MB
 * gzipped**, which is what the `schools-fr` maillage costs (0.63 MB) while
 * carrying no names at all.
 *
 * So there is no spatial thinning here, no bbox ceiling, and no per-viewport
 * proxy call. The browser is handed the register once and answers every zoom
 * from it, which removes the one caveat those layers can never remove: nothing
 * on this map is a sample. What is drawn is what is there.
 *
 *   national — 96 département PRISMS: height = students, hue = the share at
 *              bac+4 and beyond. Entered on the view's LATITUDE span (≥ 9.5°,
 *              metropolitan France being 9.8° tall), never on the larger of
 *              the two spans, which on a 16:10 viewport is mostly a statement
 *              about the window's shape.
 *   sites    — every site in view, from the pack, with its card.
 *
 * ── The national regime was a flat count fill, and that was the worst one ───
 * Until this pass the national view painted 2.96 million students as SIX
 * QUANTILE COLOURS over the 96 département polygons. That is the figure the
 * corpus names in capitals — « Représentation d'une variable quantitative
 * absolue en aplats de couleur — NOP !!!! » — and of the three layers that
 * committed it, this one committed it hardest: the students sit in about
 * thirty cities, and the polygon they were painted on has no relation to them
 * at all. Paris is 104 km² and holds 394 788 of them; the Gironde is 10 077 km²
 * — ninety-seven times the area — and holds 107 022.
 *
 * The header used to argue that choice by comparing "count fill" with "density
 * fill" and picking the count. The argument is retired: on a globe the choice
 * was never between those two, because the height axis was empty. It now
 * carries the count, and the fill carries a rate, which is the one thing a
 * fill is allowed to say. `choroplethPrism.js` holds the shared grammar and
 * every calibration figure; what follows is only what is specific to sup-fr.
 *
 * ── A3 · what each channel carried, and what it carries now ─────────────────
 *   HUE    before: the student count, in six quantile bins recomputed from the
 *          rows in hand at every load (a B1 fault, and a C1 one).
 *          now: `advancedShare` — the share of a département's graded students
 *          at bac+4 and beyond, against FROZEN breaks published below.
 *   HEIGHT before: nothing. The axis existed and no layer of this repo used it.
 *          now: the student count, on a square-root ruler — see below for the
 *          measurement that forced the square root on this layer alone.
 *   ALPHA  before: `choroplethAlpha.js`'s DESCENDING ladder, a compositing
 *          correction so that six fills stayed six ordered fills over live
 *          imagery. now: nothing. A prism body composites over the sky and
 *          over other prisms, not over the basemap, so that correction has no
 *          object here; the body is a constant {@link PRISM_BODY_ALPHA}, and
 *          the ladder is deliberately NOT imported (it would put a second,
 *          mismatched ordering on a channel that carries none).
 *
 * ── Why this layer declares `sqrt`, and it is the layer that must ───────────
 * The prism default is linear, because a length is judged directly and a
 * uniform ruler is what makes the legend readable with the map. sup-fr is the
 * declared exception, and the measurement is unambiguous. The domain runs from
 * Corse-du-Sud (738 students) to Paris (394 788) — 1 : 535, where the shared
 * grammar puts the threshold at about 1 : 30. On a linear ruler the 4 km floor
 * lands at 3.33 % of the domain, i.e. 13 333 students, and **51 of the 96
 * départements — the median is 9 109 — would be drawn at the same floored
 * height**. Half of France flattened is not a scale, it is a lie by flooring.
 * On the square-root ruler the floor lands at 444 students, below the smallest
 * département, so nothing is floored at all and every value is a height.
 *
 * The price is stated in the legend by `prismLegend`, unprompted and in
 * French: a prism twice as tall is four times as many. Measured heights at the
 * ~1 500 km national altitude, side-on: Paris 119.2 km (114.7 px), Rhône
 * 83.3 km (80.2 px), the median département 18.1 km (17.4 px), Corse-du-Sud
 * 5.2 km (5.0 px). The same values on a linear ruler: 118.4, 57.9, 4.0 and
 * 4.0 km — the last two identical, which is the defect in one line.
 *
 * ── What the hue is, and the two candidates that lost ───────────────────────
 * `supDepartements.js` carries the measurement in full. In short: students per
 * 1 000 km² ranks the same as the height (Spearman ρ = 0.974, mean displacement
 * 4.3 places out of 96) and would spend the second channel restating the
 * first; students per 1 000 inhabitants is the rate a reader would want and
 * needs a population source this layer does not have. What ships is the share
 * at bac+4 and beyond — ρ = 0.880, mean displacement 10.4 places — because it
 * answers the question the height cannot: the Nord and the Haute-Garonne are
 * both tall, and 2 800 of this register's sites are lycées running a BTS, so
 * "many students" and "a full university system" are two different facts.
 *
 * WHAT THE HUE DOES NOT DO, and the shared grammar expects it to: it does not
 * audit the prism's areal bias. A reader who reads the VOLUME rather than the
 * top edge over-reads wide rural départements, and here the colour does not
 * catch that, because the rate chosen is not area-normalised. Two mitigations,
 * both declared rather than hidden: the height legend says in French that the
 * base is the département and that its area is not neutralised, and every
 * département card still prints its students per 1 000 km². It is a stated
 * limit, not a corrected one.
 *
 * ── Rendering notes specific to this layer ──────────────────────────────────
 * · `polygon.classificationType` is CLEARED on every prism and kept on the two
 *   FLAT marks, which is the whole of the nuance. Verified in the bundled
 *   Cesium: `GroundGeometryUpdater._isOnTerrain` returns false as soon as
 *   `extrudedHeight` is defined (`index.js:148334-148336`), so on a prism the
 *   property is read into `_classificationTypeProperty` and then never used —
 *   leaving it set would be a property that lies to the next reader. A flat
 *   footprint, on the other hand, still has to drape, or a département with no
 *   published enrolment would be buried under 2 km of Alpine terrain and its
 *   absence mark would be invisible. `BOTH` covers terrain and the
 *   photorealistic mesh alike, which is why this layer never needed a
 *   per-stack switch and still does not.
 * · `surfaceFill` is therefore declared CONDITIONALLY, and it was declared not
 *   at all before: the shared "your fill is climbing the façades" notice is
 *   true only while at least one flat footprint is drawn, and false for every
 *   prism, which drapes on nothing.
 * · The base sits on the ELLIPSOID (`height = 0`), never on terrain: clamping
 *   would start the Savoie prism 2 km higher than the Landes one and so put
 *   its TOP 2 km higher at equal enrolment, which is a bias correlated with
 *   relief. The whole relief of France is 4.8 km against a 120 km prism.
 * · A MultiPolygon département raises ONE PRISM PER DRAWN PART, all at the
 *   same height, because the height is the département's value and not the
 *   part's. Corsica's two prisms are two views of one number; they are never
 *   to be added.
 * · The ambient département label rides at the TOP of its prism rather than on
 *   the ground, because the top edge is where the reading happens — and a
 *   label left at the base would be occluded by the very prism it names.
 *
 * ── Not in this pass ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * `REPRESENTATION.md` proposes a Dorling cartogram for this layer, and it is
 * the dataset in the repo where an anamorphosis is most justified: 2.96 M
 * students in ~30 cities is a distribution the map of France is a poor support
 * for. That is a different piece of work — it replaces the geometry, where
 * this replaces the sign — and it is not started here.
 *
 * ── What a dot means in the sites regime (unchanged) ────────────────────────
 * Colour is the establishment BAND — seven of them, folded from the register's
 * 14 published categories on the rules in `supFeed.js`. Size is the enrolment
 * AT THAT SITE, and unlike `schools-fr` there is no unpublished case to draw
 * around: the register is an enrolment file, so a site exists only because
 * students are counted there.
 *
 * ── Why the palette is deliberately not the schools palette ─────────────────
 * 2 800 of these 6 914 sites are lycées running a BTS or a CPGE, and
 * `schools-fr` draws every one of them too, at the same coordinate. An
 * operator with both layers on is looking at stacked dots by design. So this
 * layer's hues are DEEP and saturated where the schools ladder is pastel, and
 * its dots carry a white outline where the schools dots carry a black one —
 * two signatures that survive being overlapped, so a reader can always tell
 * which map they are reading.
