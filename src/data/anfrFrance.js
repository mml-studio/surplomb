/**
 * @module anfrFrance
 *
 * Every mast in France, drawn by WHICH GENERATION ACTUALLY TRANSMITS FROM IT.
 *
 * `anfrFeed.js` holds the reading of the 826 418-row observatoire and every
 * trap in it; `anfrMesh.js` holds the thinning policy for the middle zooms;
 * this file is the drawing.
 *
 * ── NAME COLLISION, NOT DATA COLLISION ──────────────────────────────────────
 * This repo already ships a layer called `radio`. That one is
 * radio-browser.info — internet AUDIO streams, keyed by a station UUID, played
 * through an `HTMLAudioElement`, ids prefixed `radio:`. This one is physical
 * masts keyed by ANFR's `SUP_ID`, ids prefixed `anfr-fr:`. The two share a
 * panel shelf (RÉSEAUX & CAPTEURS) and nothing else: no field, no identifier,
 * no upstream, no pick id. Anyone reading `radio` in this directory expecting
 * antennas is reading the wrong file.
 *
 * ── Two regimes, and why there is no choropleth ─────────────────────────────
 * `schools-fr`, `irve-fr` and `sup-fr` all open on 96 painted départements.
 * This layer deliberately does not, and the reason is a measurement rather
 * than a preference.
 *
 * The bundled outlines are METROPOLITAN: 96 features, no overseas geometry
 * (counted in `local_data/france_departements/departements.geojson`). Measured
 * over the whole register on 2026-09-02, the share of supports whose newest
 * radiating generation is 5G runs **59.7 % → 75.5 % across the metropolitan
 * interquartile range** — a nearly flat map — while the territories a
 * metropolitan choropleth cannot draw are the entire story: Nouvelle-Calédonie
 * **1.0 %** (611 supports), Polynésie française **8.7 %** (644),
 * Guadeloupe 29.8 %, Martinique 28.8 %, against Val-d'Oise's **84.1 %**. A
 * département choropleth here would spend the whole national view painting the
 * 59–76 % band and would silently drop the 3 822 supports where the finding
 * is. So the national view is the maillage: real mast positions, thinned, in
 * every French territory, coloured by the same channel as every other zoom.
 *
 *   maillage — real positions, spatially thinned to 1 100–2 200 dots. Measured
 *              on the real 72 700 tuples: a whole-France box (10.4° of
 *              latitude) holds **68 878** supports and 305 occupied cells, and
 *              the pick costs 15.3 ms — well inside one camera settle.
 *   supports — every support in the box, with its card. Entered at ≤ 0.32° of
 *              view span and capped by the proxy at 0.35°, because the
 *              worst-placed 0.35° box in France (anchored at 48.6725 N,
 *              2.19556 E — Paris and the inner suburbs) holds **6 462**
 *              supports, which the proxy serves as 112 831 bytes gzipped and
 *              which is one PointPrimitiveCollection.
 *
 * ── What the fill claims, what the size claims, what the RING claims ────────
 * FILL is the newest generation that RADIATES — `anfrBand(live)`, which reads
 * the in-service and technically-operational systems and never the approved
 * projects. Measured over the 72 700: **5G 50 148 · 4G 18 698 · 3G 127 ·
 * 2G 89 · rien 3 638**.
 *
 * That distribution is why the palette has two anchors and not five steps.
 * Three quarters of a five-step ramp would be spent on 216 masts — 0.30 % of
 * the country. So 5G is the one saturated colour on this layer (amber) and
 * everything older is one low-chroma steel family at three luminances. The map
 * reads "amber where 5G is, quiet where it is not", which is what the data
 * says. Nothing else on this globe uses a low-chroma steel as a categorical
 * dot fill: the greys in `schools-fr`, `irve-fr` and `radio` are all
 * *unknown-value* catch-alls, and this is a measured value.
 *
 * SIZE is the number of distinct operators on the mast, which is the only
 * "how big" this register publishes and is never missing — every row names its
 * operator. Measured: **36 671 supports carry one operator, 16 786 two,
 * 8 230 three, 11 012 four, and exactly one carries five** (SUP_ID 506104,
 * Saint-Barthélemy).
 *
 * THE PALE RING IS THE HONEST HALF, and it means one thing everywhere:
 * *an approved project is on file at this position*. **`Projet approuvé` is
 * 66 508 of the 826 418 rows — 8.05 %**, re-counted from the portal's own
 * `refine.statut` on 2026-09-02, not sampled. Two shapes carry it:
 *
 *   hollow ring   — 3 638 supports (5.00 %) where NOTHING radiates. A file at
 *                   ANFR, not a mast. Never drawn as a generation.
 *   ring on a dot — 3 776 supports that radiate today and whose approved
 *                   project would ADD a generation they do not have. Counted
 *                   with the feed's own rule: an operator re-filing for a band
 *                   already on the air is paperwork, not an upgrade, and
 *                   11 830 of the 15 606 live supports with a project on file
 *                   are exactly that.
 *
 * ── The MAST: the support drawn at its real height, in world metres ─────────
 * The register publishes `sup_nm_haut` and this layer read it, printed it on a
 * card, and drew a flat dot. A 343 m guyed mast and a 12 m rooftop pole were
 * the same mark on a 3D globe.
 *
 * The coverage was measured before anything was drawn (the count is in
 * `anfrFeed.js`, Trap 3): **72 149 of the 72 700 supports publish a usable
 * height — 99.24 %**. Median 30 m, p95 48 m, max 343.3 m. That is dense enough
 * to extrude, so the support is extruded.
 *
 * **IN WORLD UNITS, NOT IN PIXELS, and that is the whole B2 decision.** A
 * support is a physical object with a real height; drawing it at 1 m of shaft
 * per 1 m of mast means the mark shrinks with distance exactly as the mast
 * itself does, which is the branch of B2 that is legitimate — the forbidden one
 * is a thematic size composed with `scaleByDistance`, and there is none here.
 * The dot keeps its own channel unchanged: pixel size is still the operator
 * count, and it is NOT multiplied by anything. Two orthogonal channels, one
 * screen-space and one world-space.
 *
 * The dot is seated on TOP of the shaft, at the height the register gives,
 * because that is where the antennas are. It is lifted in the exact regime at
 * every span, not only where the shaft is drawn, so that crossing the shaft
 * threshold never makes a dot jump: at 0.32° of span a 30 m lift is about one
 * pixel.
 *
 * WHEN. Shafts are drawn only under **0.06° of view span** (about 6.7 km
 * across), with the exit at 0.09°. That is not a taste: at 0.32° — the top of
 * the exact regime — a median 30 m mast is about one screen pixel and a shaft
 * would be noise that changes nothing. The cost of the closest regime is
 * measured on the real positions: the fullest possible 0.06° box in France
 * holds **1 063 supports** (48.83278 N, 2.31639 E, central Paris) and the
 * fullest 0.09° box holds **1 913**, against a ceiling of 2 400 polylines that
 * therefore never bites.
 *
 * WHERE THE HEIGHT IS MISSING, THERE IS NO SHAFT — and that is the A1 half.
 * The 551 supports without one keep their dot on the ground and get no mast at
 * all, because the fallback here is the ABSENCE of the mark and never a
 * default value of it. It costs nothing to be right about, since the 551 are
 * not a random hole: **all 551 are `Intérieur sous-terrain` (506), `Tunnel`
 * (38) or `Intérieur galerie` (7)** — the register omits the height because
 * the equipment is underground and there is no mast to measure. A shaft there
 * would be an invention twice over. The count travels with the row label and
 * the legend.
 *
 * A support that radiates nothing gets a DASHED shaft. Its height is a
 * declared figure on an authorised file, not a measurement of something built,
 * and the dash is the same statement the hollow ring already makes on the dot.
 * A motif rather than a tint, per D3, because it survives the FLIR and NVG
 * passes that would flatten a colour difference.
 *
 * OCCLUSION, declared per F1: the shaft is world geometry and is depth-tested,
 * so a building in front of it hides it — which is information. The dot keeps
 * `disableDepthTestDistance` as it always had, so a mast in a dense city stays
 * clickable. The two marks are not the same sign and do not claim to be.
 *
 * ── The AZIMUTHS: one mast at a time, because that is where they exist ──────
 * A mobile antenna is not omnidirectional and the direction it faces is the
 * field a map of masts most obviously wants. **It is not in the observatoire**
 * — the CSV is 22 columns and none of them is a bearing, re-verified against
 * the live file on 2026-09-03 (the header is quoted in `anfrFeed.js`). It IS
 * in Cartoradio, per antenna, on the same on-demand call this layer already
 * makes for a clicked mast: measured over 40 supports spread through the
 * register, **324 of 328 antennas publish an orientation, 98.8 %**.
 *
 * So the sectors are drawn for the SELECTED support and for nothing else. That
 * is a limit of the transport, not a design flourish: one Cartoradio call per
 * mast is what this layer is allowed to make, and a viewport of sectors would
 * mean thousands. Saying so is the honest form; drawing a default fan on every
 * dot would be the dishonest one.
 *
 * RAYS, NOT WEDGES. ANFR publishes the bearing and publishes neither a
 * beamwidth nor a range, so a wedge would have to invent an aperture and a
 * distance. The ray is drawn at a declared **60 m** — twice the national
 * median mast height, chosen so it reads against the shaft it springs from —
 * and the card says in French that this length is a convention and not a
 * coverage claim. `orientation: 0` is drawn as due north, because it was
 * checked and it is one: 26 of 138 measured installations carry a 0, none
 * carries it alone, and 18 of the 26 are the three-sector `0/120/240`.
 *
 * An antenna whose bearing is not filed gets no ray and is counted on the
 * card. That is the same case `cctv.js` meets with an unsurveyed camera
 * heading and answers with a dashed cone — the difference is that `cctv.js`
 * has a placeholder bearing to disown, and this layer has none to draw, so the
 * stricter answer is available and is taken.
 *
 * ── The register's status field is about 5G, not about maturity ─────────────
 * Cross-tabulated over all 826 418 rows on 2026-09-02: `Techniquement
 * opérationnel` appears on **5G rows and nothing else** — all 120 891 of them —
 * and **no 5G row in this edition is ever `En service`**. The 2G/3G/4G rows
 * are `En service` (639 019) or `Projet approuvé`. So "technically operational"
 * is not a fact about one operator's rollout at one mast; it is how ANFR files
 * 5G as a whole.
 *
 * The card USED to print it, per mast, as "la 5G est allumée ici mais pas
 * encore déclarée ouverte au public". It no longer does, and the reason is
 * the sentence above: a status that is true of all 120 891 5G rows in the
 * edition is not news about the mast under the cursor, and a caveat that
 * fires on every 5G mast in France reads as a caveat about THAT mast. The
 * distinction is kept in the data — `svc` and `live` are still separate masks
 * and colour still reads `live` — and it is documented here, where a
 * register-wide convention belongs.
 *
 * ── What this map cannot show, by statute ───────────────────────────────────
 * Quoted from the canonical dataset: *"Installations radioélectriques de plus
 * de 5 watts, hormis celles de l'Aviation Civile et des ministères de la
 * Défense et de l'Intérieur."* Blank ground beside a base or an airport is
 * policy, not a gap in the data. And the observatoire is PUBLIC MOBILE only:
 * a support that also carries a microwave link, TNT or PMR is drawn here as a
 * mobile mast and its card names the rest from Cartoradio rather than letting
 * the dot imply the whole installation.

// ── ONE `Material` PER POLYLINE, AND NEVER A SHARED ONE ──────────────────────
//
// This file used to memoize five materials and hand the same instance to every
// shaft that wanted that appearance, on the stated ground that a
// `PolylineCollection` buckets by material INSTANCE. Both halves of that were
// wrong, and the first half was a latent crash.
//
// `Polyline._destroy()` calls `this._material.destroy()` unconditionally, and
// Cesium's `destroyObject` replaces every method with a thrower rather than
// making the object inert. So the FIRST shaft destroys the shared material and
// the SECOND throws `DeveloperError: This object was destroyed`. Reproduced on
// this Cesium build for `destroy()` and for `removeAll()`, solid and dashed
// alike: two polylines, one material, one throw. Both are live paths here —
// `disable()` calls `removeAll()`, `destroy()` calls `primitives.remove()`,
// which destroys — so the layer threw on teardown with two shafts up.
//
// And the bucketing claim is false. `sortPolylinesIntoBuckets` keys on
// `material.type` (`polylineBuckets[material.type]`), and the draw pass then
// splits commands on `createMaterialId(polyline._material)`, which is
// `type + JSON(uniform values)`. Both are VALUE keys: two `Color` materials
// carrying the same colour batch into ONE command however many instances they
// are. What costs a draw call is a change of appearance between two
// CONSECUTIVE polylines — a question of ORDER, which `reconcileMasts` now
// answers, not of allocation.
//
// Measured price of the fix: 3.5 KiB per material, so 8.2 MiB at the 2 400
// shaft cap — against a throw on every teardown.
//
// Each pooled polyline owns its materials on these two slots. A shaft may wear
// either regime over its life, so it keeps one of each rather than swapping
// instances: an orphaned instance is one Cesium will never destroy, and a
// re-shared one is the bug above coming back.

/**
 * WHAT THE MAST CHANNEL STILL OWES THE READER — which is the ABSENCES, and
 * nothing else.
 *
 * This used to print five rows: a `Fût` explainer, three numbered height marks
 * (p05, median, p95 of the register, drawn as graphite bars), and the two
 * absence rows below. Four of them are gone, under the house rule that
 * `#map-legend` carries the COLOUR channel and not the FORM channel (PR #138,
 * which deleted `sizeFootprintGlyph` for the same reason and cut the two mark
 * rows off `local-airports`).
 *
 * The three height marks were a SIZE ladder in one flat graphite. Their scale
 * is 1:1 — one drawn metre is one metre of support — so what they positioned a
 * reader inside was the national distribution, which is a statistician's
 * question and not a map reader's: somebody looking at a street compares the
 * two masts in front of them to each other and to the buildings, and the globe
 * answers that unaided. The distribution stays measured and quoted in this
 * module's header, where the next person to touch the channel will look.
 *
 * The `Fût` row said a shaft is a shaft. A shaft under a dot decodes right
 * without a key.
 *
 * What is left is the pair no shape can state, because they are marks that are
 * NOT THERE: a mast drawn with no shaft reads as a short mast, and a ceiling
 * that withholds a shaft reads as a missing measurement. Both are decoded
 * WRONG unaided, which is the one case the rule keeps a form row for. The
 * selected support's azimuths join them when there are any, for the same
 * reason — a 60 m ray is a drawing convention and reads as a coverage claim.
 *
 * The rows only appear where the channel does. Publishing a mast key beside a
 * maillage that draws no shafts would be a legend for a mark that is not on
 * the screen.
 *
 * @param {object} [state] Injected for tests.
 * @returns {Array<object>}
