/**
 * The render profile: `full` or `lite`, decided before the Viewer exists.
 *
 * ── WHY A PROFILE AND NOT A SETTING ─────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Two of the four fixed render costs — `msaaSamples` and
 * `preserveDrawingBuffer` — are Viewer construction arguments. They cannot be
 * changed afterwards, so a decision taken after the globe is up is a decision
 * taken too late for half of what it governs. This module therefore runs from
 * static signals available on the first line of `main.js`, and every consumer
 * reads it rather than guessing again.
 *
 * ── WHAT IT MAY AND MAY NOT CHANGE ──────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `lite` never changes WHAT is on screen: not a layer, not a datum, not a
 * label's text. It changes how many samples a pixel gets, how many pixels a
 * frame has, and how hard the globe refines. A reader on a 2018 laptop and a
 * reader on a workstation see the same France; one of them sees it with softer
 * edges while the camera moves.
 *
 * ── THE TWO-PHASE DECISION, AND WHY THE SECOND PHASE IS PERSISTED ───────────
 *
 * The static signals (`hardwareConcurrency`, `deviceMemory`, the GPU's
 * unmasked renderer string, `prefers-reduced-motion`) are cheap and available
 * immediately, and they are also guesses: a renderer string is a marketing
 * name, and `deviceMemory` is capped at 8 by every browser that ships it.
 * The only honest measure is how long this machine actually takes to draw this
 * scene — the p90 of its first `FRAME_SAMPLE_COUNT` frames.
 *
 * That measure arrives seconds after the Viewer was constructed, which is too
 * late for MSAA and `preserveDrawingBuffer` on THIS visit — so it does not try
 * to rescue this visit at all. It writes the verdict to `localStorage` and the
 * NEXT visit opens with it, complete. A slow machine pays full price once and
 * never again.
 *
 * Applying it live was the first design and it was wrong twice over: turning
 * sharpening off and MSAA down four seconds into a page load reads as a
 * glitch, and those particular sixty frames — measured during the intro
 * flight, while tiles decode — are the least representative sixty of the
 * session. Measured on this repo's own bench, counting them naively put an
 * Apple M5 at a p90 of 33.9 ms.
 *
 * ── WHY `?perf=` DOES NOT PERSIST ───────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `?perf=lite` is a debugging and A/B instrument, and links get shared. A
 * parameter someone pastes into a chat must not silently rewrite the render
 * profile of everyone who clicks it — so the URL forces the CURRENT SESSION
 * only. The DISPLAY-rail switch is the operator's own choice, and that one
 * persists. Neither is ever written into a share link (`src/sharelink.js`
 * serializes an explicit field list; the profile is not in it, and must not
 * be added: a link records what someone is looking at, not the machine they
 * looked at it on).

 * Cesium's vocabulary, not "no antialiasing at all" — the FXAA stage is a
 * separate pass and still runs, which is why thin geometry survives the trade.
 *
 * `src/data/vigicrues.js` and `src/data/gasFrance.js` both document their
 * stroke widths against `msaaSamples: 4`. Checked when this landed: the
 * narrowest polyline either of them draws is 2.2 px (Vigicrues UNKNOWN) and

 * of `geoMeshThinning`'s grid even at 60 % (the lowest tier, 1 100, becomes
 * 660), so `lite` spends its cut on the SECOND dot in a crowded cell and never

 * outranks it, and the two things a PERSON can say — `?perf=full` and the
