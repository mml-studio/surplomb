/**
 * @module layerCoverage
 *
 * WHERE a layer has data, as a table the panel can read — so a control can say
 * "not here" instead of looking broken.
 *
 * ── The defect this exists to close ─────────────────────────────────────────
 * `comptages-fr` draws 2 946 arcs of Paris street and nothing else on Earth:
 * its whole extent is 12,6 km by 10,0 km. It was a companion of the `traffic`
 * row WITHOUT `optIn`, so switching road traffic on over Tokyo switched it on
 * too — and `getRowControls()` then contributed SEVEN hour chips (`Moyenne
 * ouvrée` … `W-E 18 h`) to a strip of fifteen. Seven of fifteen controls, on
 * every view of the planet, steering a layer with no payload.
 *
 * The obvious repair — hide the control outside Paris — is the wrong one, and
 * the reason is discoverability: a chip that only exists over Paris is a chip
 * nobody ever learns about, because you have to already know it exists to go
 * and look for it. So the rule here is DECLARE, NEVER HIDE. The control stays
 * visible everywhere, it states its own territory, and it offers the flight.
 *
 * ── Three states, and they are not the same statement ───────────────────────
 *   • `in`    — the camera intersects an area the layer holds data for.
 *   • `out`   — it does not. The layer would draw nothing here, and saying so
 *               is not an error message: it is the layer's territory.
 *   • `dark`  — inside the coverage, inside a documented HOLE. `road-status-fr`
 *               covers the non-conceded national road network and Île-de-France
 *               has no publisher at all, so Paris is black on a layer that is
 *               otherwise national. That is not "out of coverage", it is
 *               "covered and empty, and here is who does not publish".
 *
 * A layer with no row in this table returns `null`, which means "no territorial
 * claim recorded" — never "everywhere". The panel treats `null` exactly as it
 * treated every layer before this module existed, so adding a row is opt-in and
 * a missing row costs nothing.
 *
 * ── Why the boxes are restated here rather than imported ────────────────────
 * `comptagesParis.js` exports `COMPTAGES_PARIS_BOX` and `fraicheurParis.js`
 * exports `FRAICHEUR_PARIS_BOX`, and importing them would be the DRY move. It
 * is also the move that would undo the fix: both modules import Cesium and both
 * are lazy chunks, so an import here — in a module the panel loads at boot —
 * would pull the Paris layers into the entry bundle for every visitor on Earth,
 * which is the exact cost `optIn` was added to stop paying.
 *
 * So the numbers are restated, and `layerCoverage.test.mjs` asserts they equal
 * the layers' own exported boxes. Drift is a test failure, not a silent lie.
 *
 * The dark areas ARE imported: `roadStatusCoverage.js` is pure (it imports only
 * `viewportBox.js`), it is already the measured source of truth for where the
 * DIR feeds are black, and a second copy of that table is the one thing worse
 * than a restated box.
