/**
 * @module anfrMesh
 *
 * The middle regime of the ANFR layer: the zooms between "all of France" and
 * "one street", where neither 96 painted départements nor 68 852 overlapping
 * masts is the honest answer.
 *
 * The policy and its justification live in `geoMeshThinning.js`, which the
 * charge-point layer worked out first (`irveMesh.js` carries the measurements
 * that argue for it) and the schools layer adopted second. This file is the
 * ANTENNA adapter: it names the tuple in this domain, sets the budgets, and
 * picks the world-locked variant of the policy (`selectGeoMeshWorld`, see
 * {@link selectAnfrMesh}) so that a pan does not re-elect the dots.
 *
 * ── Why this layer needs the middle regime at all ───────────────────────────
 * `sup-fr` deliberately has no maillage, and its argument is a byte count: its
 * whole register is 0.62 MB gzipped, so the browser is handed it once. That
 * argument does not survive here, and both halves of it fail.
 *
 * The pack is too big. Measured on the real payload: the 72 700 supports with
 * their three generation masks, their operator and system masks, their nature
 * and their height are 3 553 551 bytes and **1 046 345 gzipped** — 1.7× the
 * `sup-fr` register and 1.7× the schools maillage. The mesh tuple below is
 * **392 035 bytes gzipped**, a third of that.
 *
 * And even if it were free, it would be unreadable. Measured against the real
 * coordinates on a 16:10 viewport: a view one notch under the national
 * threshold (9.4° of latitude) centred on Lyon contains **66 769 supports** —
 * 92% of the country in one screen. Drawing them is not a map of the network,
 * it is a silhouette of France in dots.
 *
 * ── What the tuple carries ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * `[lat, lon, operators, band]`.
 *
 * The WEIGHT is the number of distinct operators on the mast, which is what
 * "biggest" means for a support: measured over the 72 700, **36 671 carry one
 * operator, 16 786 two, 8 230 three, 11 012 four, and exactly one carries
 * five** (Saint-Barthélemy, SUP_ID 506104 — Orange, Digicel, Dauphin Telecom,
 * Free Caraïbes and UTS Caraïbes on one 30 m pylon). A four-operator macro site
 * genuinely is the structure a cell should be represented by, and unlike a
 * roll or a charging power it is never missing: every row in the register names
 * its operator, so the weight is 0 for nothing.
 *
 * The CATEGORY is `ANFR_BAND_INDEX` — the newest generation that actually
 * radiates. Its ordering is what makes `cellRepresentative` safe: a tie between
 * two equally common bands in a cell resolves to the LOWER index, so a cell
 * that is half approved-project and half 5G is drawn as the project. The
 * modal-category rule matters more here than it did for schools, because the
 * distribution is so lopsided — 50 148 of 72 700 supports are `5g` — that
 * representing a cell by its largest member would paint rural France 5G on the
 * strength of one upgraded mast per cell.
 *
 * ── Why the tuple does NOT carry the support height ─────────────────────────
 * The drawing extrudes each support to its real height in the closest regime,
 * and the obvious next thought is to put the height in the tuple so the
 * maillage could do it too. It is refused, and on two measurements rather than
 * on taste.
 *
 * The first is the wire. `sup_nm_haut` is one decimal place over a 0.6–343.3 m
 * range, so it is three to five characters a row across 72 700 rows in a
 * document that gzips to 392 035 bytes precisely BECAUSE its four columns sort
 * together and share leading digits. A fifth column with no spatial
 * autocorrelation to exploit is the one that does not compress.
 *
 * The second is that nobody could see it. The shafts are drawn under 0.06° of
 * view span — about 6.7 km across — because at the top of the exact regime a
 * median 30 m mast is already about one screen pixel. The maillage answers
 * from 0.32° upward, where the same mast is a fifth of a pixel. A height in
 * this tuple would be a field that is paid for on every load and drawn at no
 * zoom this file serves.
 *
 * And a cell REPRESENTATIVE's height would be a lie of a third kind: the
 * thinning already speaks for a cell through one member, which is defensible
 * for a modal band and for an operator count, and is not defensible for a
 * length that the eye would read as a measurement of the ground it stands on.
 *
 * ── What the maillage cannot say, and what it can ───────────────────────────
 * `schools-fr`'s maillage carries no names, so a mesh dot's card says
 * "Établissement" until a click fetches the real one. This one has no such
 * hole: a support has no name to lose. Both channels the map uses — the band
 * and the operator count — are IN the tuple, so a mesh dot already says
 * "4 opérateurs · 5G en service" truthfully. What the click adds is the exact
 * operators, the frequency bands, the mast's nature and height, and the nearest
 * published exposure measurement.
 *
 * Dependency-free and side-effect-free (no Cesium, no DOM) so it runs
 * identically in the browser, in the Vite dev-server proxy, and under
 * `node --test`.
