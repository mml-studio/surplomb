/**
 * NOAA NDBC marine observation buoys — latest report per station.
 *
 * Fetched live through the keyless `/api/ndbc` proxy (10-minute TTL, disk
 * cache, serve-stale). Stations are FIXED points, so unlike vessels or
 * aircraft nothing here interpolates or animates: a poll replaces values in
 * place and the render governor is only nudged on that discrete change.
 *
 * NOAA IS THE OPERATOR, NOT THE EXTENT
 * ------------------------------------
 * `latest_obs` republishes international partner moorings beside NOAA's own,
 * so this layer is not a map of American waters. Counted on the 2026-09-01
 * report: 882 stations, 38 in the eastern hemisphere — 28 in the North Sea
 * and north-east Atlantic, 19 in the western Pacific, 2 in the Indian Ocean.
 * The network is DENSEST over the Americas, which the map shows for itself;
 * that density is why the layer used to carry a `US` scope chip, and why it
 * no longer does — see the `marine-buoys` entry in `layerTaxonomy.js`.
 *
 * WHY MOST BUOYS SHOW NO WAVE HEIGHT
 * ----------------------------------
 * The network is not homogeneous. Measured over the full 892-station report on
 * 2026-08-26: 21% carry wave height, 57% sea temperature, 72% wind. Only 533
 * of 892 report wave height OR sea temperature at all. A station with no wave
 * sensor is not a station reporting a flat sea, so a missing value renders as
 * an omitted line — never as `0.0 m` and never as `—` styled like a reading.
 * The layer's status line carries the measured/total split so the sparseness
 * is visible rather than inferred from gaps. Re-counted on the 2026-09-03
 * report: 266 of 898 (30%) carry wave height. The coverage MOVES, which is why
 * neither the tally nor the legend below is hard-coded from one day's count.
 *
 * COLOR ENCODES SEA STATE, AND ONLY WHERE SEA STATE IS KNOWN
 * ----------------------------------------------------------
 * Buoys reporting wave height are colored on the WMO sea-state ladder. Buoys
 * that report nothing marine stay neutral grey: coloring them by their air
 * temperature or wind would imply a sea reading they never took.
 *
 * HEIGHT ENCODES THE SWELL — IN WORLD UNITS, NOT IN PIXELS
 * --------------------------------------------------------
 * Significant wave height is the reason anyone looks at a buoy, it is a
 * continuous physical LENGTH in metres, and it used to be locked inside a
 * nine-step hue. It now also drives a vertical STEM rising from the station.
 *
 * B2 allows a quantity on a globe through exactly two channels: constant
 * screen pixels, or world units. This layer takes WORLD UNITS.
 *
 *  1. Hs *is* a length. A stem in metres is that same length magnified, which
 *     is what lets the exaggeration be inverted by eye — "30 km of stem,
 *     therefore 3 m of swell". A bar measured in pixels supports no such
 *     sentence; it is a chart glued to the sea.
 *  2. Nothing here composes with a `scaleByDistance` — the layer has none, and
 *     the dot's `pixelSize` is now CONSTANT (see the next section), so the two
 *     size channels cannot multiply into the inversion B2 warns about. A stem
 *     that shrinks with distance shrinks because it is far away, not because
 *     its value fell, and that is the reading a relief map wants.
 *  3. 266 constant-pixel bars over the western Atlantic would fuse into a
 *     picket fence at every zoom. World-unit stems thin out with the view.
 *
 * THE EXAGGERATION, AND WHERE IT IS PUBLISHED
 * -------------------------------------------
 * ×10 000 — one metre of swell draws ten kilometres of stem. At true scale an
 * 8 m sea on a 6 371 km globe is 1.3 millionths of the radius, i.e. nothing;
 * so the factor is a READING SCALE rather than a measurement, and it is
 * LINEAR, so a stem twice as tall is twice the swell.
 *
 * THE FACTOR IS ON THE GLOBE; THE ARGUMENT FOR IT IS HERE. `CARTOGRAPHY.md`
 * F7(a) is P0 and requires the REGISTER to be named in the legend in full
 * words, so the stem row reads "Échelle de lecture, pas une hauteur réelle :
 * 1 m de houle dessine 10 km de tige" — fourteen words. What went is the
 * hundred that followed it, and the three ruler marks and the floor row below:
 * 99 words teaching an inversion no reader performs, because the card on the
 * buoy already prints `1.0 m` and the cohort that gets a card is sorted by Hs
 * (`selectBuoyOverlayCohort`). What the stem carries on screen is the relief
 * and the order; why the scale is shaped this way is for whoever changes it.
 * Apparent heights,
 * computed with `choroplethPrism.prismApparentPx()` (viewport 1000 px, aspect
 * 1.6, fov π/3), for a stem seen side-on:
 *
 *     camera →     200 km   500 km   1 500 km   3 000 km   8 000 km
 *     Hs  8 m      570 px   231 px      77 px      38 px      14 px
 *     Hs  2 m      144 px    58 px      19 px      10 px       4 px
 *     Hs  0.8 m     58 px    23 px       8 px       4 px       1 px
 *
 * Linear was preferred to the sqrt mode `choroplethPrism.js` offers, and the
 * price is stated rather than hidden. On the report of 2026-09-03 — 898
 * stations, 266 with a wave sensor, median Hs 0.8 m, tallest 4.1 m — most
 * stems are under 10 px at ocean-basin range and the map looks flat. THE SEA
 * WAS FLAT. A scale that made a calm day look eventful would be the defect.
 * The same scale puts a Biscay storm at 8 m on 80 km of stem, readable from
 * 3 000 km out, which is the whole point of the channel.
 *
 * The stem does NOT disable the depth test, unlike the dot above it. A relief
 * has to be hidden by the Earth's limb, or a Pacific swell would draw across
 * Europe. The dot keeps `disableDepthTestDistance` because a station marker is
 * a locator, not a relief — two marks, two policies, on purpose.
 *
 * WHY THE BUOYS LOOKED LIKE THEY DRIFTED, AND WHAT ACTUALLY MOVES
 * --------------------------------------------------------------
 * Field report, 2026-09-03: the buoys "drift and cross the globe". Nothing
 * here animates — positions come from one `Cartesian3.fromDegrees` per poll,
 * the parser is positionally correct, and no property is a callback. The
 * motion was an ASYMMETRY between the layer's three marks, all on the same
 * station: the dot ignored depth AND was never culled, so a Pacific station
 * painted straight through the planet; its own stem was depth-tested and so
 * disappeared behind the limb; and its card was already horizon-culled by the
 * overlay host (`horizonCull: true`). A dot with no stem and no card, sliding
 * across the disc of the globe as the camera turned, is what "drift" was.
 *
 * THE FIX IS THE CULL, NOT THE DEPTH TEST. The dot keeps
 * `disableDepthTestDistance: POSITIVE_INFINITY`, and the far side is removed
 * by an `EllipsoidalOccluder` instead — the settled convention of this repo,
 * reached twice from bug reports. `flights.js` states it at
 * `_groundDepthDistance()` ("far-side planes are still removed by the fleet
 * tick's horizon occluder, which never depended on depth") and
 * `aisLiveVessels.js` states it again at its billboard ("the tile sea mesh is
 * not the geoid exactly, so a depth-tested chevron at the geoid still clips
 * out behind local tide/mesh noise"). A finite depth distance here would buy
 * the same far-side hiding at the price of buoys that blink out over photoreal
 * water, and would not help at all when Google 3D tiles own the planet and
 * nothing writes far-side depth.
 *
 * WHAT IS DRAWN IS WHAT IS IN FRAME
 * ---------------------------------
 * Beyond the limb test, a station outside the camera's own view rectangle is
 * hidden too, and the card cohort is re-picked from the survivors. Both marks
 * and the card now agree on one visibility for one station, which is the
 * property that was missing. The pass runs on `camera.changed` at the shared
 * 5 % sensitivity (`cameraSensitivity.js`, ref-counted — this layer claims and
 * releases like the other eleven), costs one occluder test and one box test
 * per station over ~900 stations, and republishes cards ONLY when some
 * station's visibility actually flipped.
 *
 * A station's position is on the SEA SURFACE — the geoid, `h = N` — not on the
 * ellipsoid. `heightReference: NONE` was pinning every dot to h = 0 while the
 * EGM96 undulation runs -106..+85 m; the AIS layer already anchors its vessels
 * this way, and two maritime layers disagreeing about where the sea is would
 * show as buoys floating above or under the ships beside them.
 *
 * A1 · NO SENSOR MEANS NO STEM, AND THE DOT SAYS SO TOO
 * ----------------------------------------------------
 * A station with no wave sensor gets NO STEM — not a stem of height zero. And
 * because a vertical mark has zero apparent length when viewed from directly
 * overhead, the absence cannot rest on the stem alone: the dot itself changes
 * SHAPE. A measured station is a filled disc on the WMO ladder; an unmeasured
 * one is a hollow grey ring (15 % fill, 2 px outline). Shape, not size, and a
 * ring survives the NVG and FLIR passes that flatten a tint (D3).
 *
 * A measured 0.0 m is the opposite case and is drawn as a measurement: it gets
 * the floor stem below, because a flat sea was observed. That pair — 0.0 m
 * with a stem, no-sensor with none — is A1 in one image.
 *
 * A3 · WHAT EACH CHANNEL CARRIED, AND WHAT IT CARRIES NOW
 * ------------------------------------------------------
 *   DOT SIZE   before: 9 px measured / 6 px unmeasured — the size channel,
 *              the only one Bertin gives to an absolute quantity, spent on a
 *              two-state qualitative flag.
 *              now:    CONSTANT for every station. It carries nothing.
 *   DOT SHAPE  before: nothing.
 *              now:    filled disc = wave sensor, hollow ring = none.
 *   HEIGHT     before: unused. `extrudedHeight`/vertical marks appeared in one
 *              data layer in the whole repo.
 *              now:    Hs in metres, ×10 000, linear, floored and clipped.
 *   HUE        before: the WMO sea-state class. Unchanged.
 *              now:    the WMO sea-state class. Unchanged.
 *
 * DECLARED REDUNDANCY: hue and height both carry Hs, and that is deliberate.
 * Two reasons, both specific to a globe. (a) A vertical stem seen from the
 * nadir has no apparent length at all — its projected length goes as the sine
 * of the angle between the stem and the view ray — so at top-down framing the
 * colour is the ONLY surviving reading. (b) They are not the same statement:
 * the height is the continuous metre value, the hue is the named WMO class a
 * mariner actually speaks ("mer forte"). The legend no longer says this out
 * loud — a reader who sees one colour per stem is not harmed by not being told
 * it is deliberate, and the sentence cost 83 words of the right-hand rail. It
 * is a claim about the DESIGN, addressed to whoever changes the design, so it
 * is stated here.
 *
 * A5 · THE FLOOR AND THE CEILING, BOTH COUNTED
 * --------------------------------------------
 * FLOOR — a stem shorter than 2 km is invisible at any useful range, so a
 * measured value below 0.2 m is drawn at 2 km and says "measured", not "how
 * much". The NDBC field is quantised to the decimetre, so the floor covers
 * exactly the 0.0 and 0.1 m readings: 24 of 266 wave stations on 2026-09-03
 * (9 %). It costs 1.4 % of the scale. The floor has NO legend row — it is a
 * 1.4 % distortion at the bottom of a channel whose whole job is the order of
 * the big values — but it is still counted, in `getStats().swell.floored`.
 * CEILING — the domain is frozen at 14 m, the top of the last NAMED band of
 * the WMO ladder, so the two channels clip at the same place for the same
 * published reason. Above it the stem stays at 140 km and switches to DASHES,
 * the repo's existing sign for "this attribute is not being asserted". That
 * one DOES keep a legend row, with a dashed swatch to match, because dashes on
 * a stem are a mark a reader can see and cannot decode — and the row appears
 * only when a station is actually clipped. The frozen bound is never
 * re-derived from a poll (C1): the same buoy is the same height in every
 * share link.
 *
 * PERF
 * ----
 * One entity per station, as before — the stem is a second graphic on the SAME
 * entity, so the entity count and the QA harness's station tally are unchanged.
 * Only the ~21–30 % of stations with a wave sensor get a polyline (266 of 898
 * on 2026-09-03), each two vertices with `arcType: NONE` so Cesium subdivides
 * nothing. Every property is a constant, so the stems are static geometry: no
 * per-frame callback, no `CallbackProperty`, nothing to re-evaluate between
 * the five-minute polls.

 * The key this layer publishes through `getRowControls().legend`, which

 * since the panel ships collapsed and a share link ignores the recipient's
 * stored panel preference.
 *
 * ── WHAT THIS BLOCK USED TO BE ──────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Eleven rows and 388 words on a calm report; seventeen rows on a rough one,
 * enough to overflow the rail and push the layer's own name off the top. Four
 * of those rows were a graduated RULER — 8 m, 2 m, 0,5 m, and the floor — 99
 * words spent teaching a reader to invert ×10 000 by eye. Three more carried
 * this layer's design defence: `ÉCHELLE DE LECTURE`, `REDONDANCE DÉLIBÉRÉE`,
 * `Domaine gelé`, `Coût : 1,4 % de l'échelle`.
 *
 * THE RULER WENT BECAUSE THE MAP ALREADY PRINTS THE METRES. Up to
 * {@link BUOY_OVERLAY_COHORT_LIMIT} = 96 stations carry a card, and
 * {@link selectBuoyOverlayCohort} sorts that cohort by `priority`, which is Hs
 * — so the tallest stems on screen are precisely the ones with their exact
 * reading written beside them, `1.0 m · Slight`. A scale nobody has to invert
 * needs no marks. What the stem still carries is the RELIEF and the ORDER, and
 * an order is decoded off the marks themselves: the Biscay storm towers over
 * the Channel beside it whether or not a key prints "8 m". That is the
 * argument `airportsPack.airportMarkLegend` makes for the disc diameters, in
 * the one other place this repo spent a legend on a size ladder.
 *
 * THE DEFENCE WENT BECAUSE IT WAS NEVER ADDRESSED TO THE READER. Every one of
 * those statements is still true and still frozen (C1); they are argued at
 * length in this module's header, where the person who can act on them reads.
 * The counts they came with are not lost either — `getStats().swell` publishes
 * the whole tally, `floored` and `atOrAbove` included, which is where A5's
 * "countable" belongs. Printed on the globe, they were answering a question
 * the reader had not asked. The reader needs to know that a stick means waves.
 *
 * ── WHAT SURVIVES, AND WHY EACH ONE HAD TO ──────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Three drawn marks no reader can decode unaided, and the colour ladder:
 *
 *   the STEM    a vertical bar rising out of the sea is not self-evident on a
 *               globe; nothing else on screen says it means waves.
 *   the RING    hollow = no wave sensor. A shape, per A1 — the only channel
 *               separating "measured a flat sea" from "never measured", and
 *               the one that survives the NVG and FLIR passes (D3).
 *   the DASHES  off the top of the frozen domain. A shape again, and a row
 *               that appears only when a station is actually in that state.
 * AND WHY THE TWO SHAPE ROWS SURVIVED WHERE THE AIRPORTS' DID NOT. #138 struck
 * "Piste tracée" and "Emprise au sol" on the grounds that a shape is decoded
 * without a key — "a line laid along a runway IS a runway". That test is about
 * ICONICITY, and it is the right one: those marks resemble what they name.
 * Neither of these does. Nothing about a hollow ring says "no wave sensor", and
 * nothing about a dash says "past 14 metres"; both are arbitrary signs, and an
 * arbitrary sign is exactly the case D1 reserves a key for. A future pass
 * tidying legends by symmetry with the airports would be removing the rows that
 * carry the layer's two silent failure modes.
 *
 *   the HUE     the WMO ladder, with its counts — which are the reading of the
 *               day ("144 buoys in a slight sea, 12 in a moderate one") and
 *               the reason the bands stay one row each rather than collapsing
 *               into a gradient strip that could carry no tally.
 *
 * ── ONE ROW KEEPS A `blurb`, AND IT IS NOT OPTIONAL ────────────────────────
 *
 * `CARTOGRAPHY.md` F7(a), P0: a vertical length belongs to one of four
 * REGISTERS, nothing on screen distinguishes them, and the register is to be
 * named "in full words, in the module header AND in the legend" — the document
 * says "ÉCHELLE DE LECTURE" and "hauteur réelle" must never be left to be
 * guessed. This layer is register (3), a published convention, and it shares
 * the globe with register (1) layers that draw metres at 1:1.
 *
 * So the stem row carries fourteen words. Not the hundred and one it used to:
 * F7(a) asks for the register to be NAMED, and the argument for the register —
 * why ×10 000, why linear, why 14 m — is what belongs to this header. The
 * factor rides along because it is the shortest thing that makes "échelle de
 * lecture" concrete, and because F7(b) does the real work here anyway: the
 * shortest stem is 2 km, above every world height in the repo, so the two
 * registers cannot be confused by amplitude even before a word is read.
 *
 * Every other row is its own whole message, which is what lets it survive at
 * any rail width and reach a screen reader as one string rather than as a
 * heading trailed by a paragraph.
 *
 * Every entry still carries a finite `count` ON PURPOSE. The panel-row
 * renderer appends `_formatCount(item.count)` unconditionally and
 * `_formatCount(undefined)` renders the string "undefined" (`manager.js`, a
 * known pre-existing defect that `choroplethPrism.prismLegend` documents and
 * lives with). Giving every row a real tally sidesteps it here without
 * touching a file this layer does not own.
 *
 * @param {ReturnType<typeof summarizeSwellStems>} summary Render tally.
 * @returns {Array<{label:string, color:?string, count:number, glyph?:string}>}
