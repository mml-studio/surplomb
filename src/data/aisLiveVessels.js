/**
 * @module aisLiveVessels
 * @description Live AIS contacts: a heading-oriented chevron per vessel, a
 * decluttered card cohort, a selected-vessel trail, and — since the size pass —
 * the hull, drawn at its real length and beam when the camera is low enough to
 * read it.
 *
 * ══ THE SIZE CHANNEL ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * ── What was wrong ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Every chevron was 32 px of artwork at one of three scales — 0.60, 0.68, 0.78
 * — chosen by SPEED: under 8 knots, under 18, above. So a 400 m container ship
 * and a 12 m harbour tug drew the same mark unless one of them happened to be
 * moving faster, and the one channel Bertin reserves for an absolute quantity
 * was spent on a three-step classification of a variable that is already
 * legible twice over (the card prints `12.4KT`, and `labelPriority` ranks by
 * it). Nothing on screen could have told the reader, either.
 *
 * Meanwhile the length was IN THE FEED and being deleted. AIS message 5 and
 * message 24 part B carry A/B/C/D — antenna to bow, stern, port, starboard —
 * and `vite.config.js`'s ingest kept the name, the type, the destination and
 * the IMO out of exactly that message, and dropped the four numbers that
 * describe the ship.
 *
 * ── What was measured before choosing anything ─────────────────────────────
 *
 * Live AISStream feed, world bounding box, two independent runs on 2026-09-03
 * (5 min and 4 min):
 *
 *   · 18 308 / 15 982 distinct MMSIs carried a position;
 *   · **16.2 % of them publish a usable hull** (length AND beam). Over the
 *     French bounding box specifically: 666 of 3 756 contacts, **17.7 %**;
 *   · 1 709 of 4 307 static dimension blocks were ALL ZEROS — the "not
 *     available" default of an unconfigured transponder, and the single most
 *     common shape on the wire;
 *   · length distribution over the measured hulls (m): min 4 · p05 12 ·
 *     p10 15 · p25 22 · **median 40** · p75 105 · p90 183 · p99 332 · max 400.
 *     Beam: median 10 · p90 30 · max 80.
 *
 * Four contacts in five publish nothing. That single number is why this pass
 * refuses to give them a default size: it would be inventing the size of 82 %
 * of the map, which is the aircraft defect this repo has just corrected ("97 %
 * de la flotte visible portait une silhouette inventée",
 * docs/PLAN-CARTOGRAPHIE.md § 1.4).
 *
 * ── What is drawn now, in two regimes ──────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * ABOVE the hull altitude — the chevron, in CONSTANT PIXELS, area ∝ length
 * overall (`vesselArrowScale`, `vesselLabels.js`). This is the first branch of
 * rule B2, and it is legal here for one verifiable reason: this layer sets no
 * `scaleByDistance` on its billboards, so nothing composes with the thematic
 * size. Checked, not assumed.
 *
 * BELOW it — the same chevron PLUS the hull as a five-vertex polygon in WORLD
 * UNITS, at true length and beam, oriented to the vessel's heading. That is
 * B2's second branch and it is the right one for a physical object: the hull
 * shrinks with distance because the ship does. The threshold is derived from
 * the scene's own optics rather than picked (`hullAltitudeM`): 15.6 km on a
 * 900 px canvas at Cesium's default 60° fovy, the height at which a 200 m hull
 * still spans 10 px.
 *
 * The chevron never leaves, and that is deliberate — there is no altitude at
 * which every hull is legible (a 40 m median contact needs 3 km), so the
 * chevron stays the contact marker and the hull is the measurement.
 *
 * ── What refuses to be drawn, and is counted ───────────────────────────────
 *
 * · No published dimensions → a HOLLOW, DASHED chevron at a fixed size, off
 *   the scale by its SHAPE. Not a small solid chevron, which would read as a
 *   small ship (A1, and B5 on the shape channel).
 * · Length but no beam → the chevron gets its area, the hull does not exist. A
 *   width is not derivable from a length.
 * · No heading and no course over ground → no hull. Drawn pointing north by
 *   default it would assert an orientation nobody measured.
 * · Beyond {@link HULL_RENDER_CAP} → not drawn. The `n / N` and the criterion
 *   (nearest to the camera first) ride in the layer's stats — rule A5.
 *
 * ── Cost, measured ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Building 400 hulls costs 2.7 ms median on this machine (min 2.15, max 3.34
 * over seven warm runs; 200 → 1.8 ms, 800 → 4.5 ms) for 2 000 vertices and
 * 3 600 indices in ONE batched primitive. It is gated three ways: the geometry
 * only exists under the altitude threshold, it is rebuilt only on the existing
 * 800 ms visibility pass, and only when {@link hullSetSignature} changes —
 * which it does not while orbiting a moored harbour, because heading is
 * quantised and positions move only on a poll. Above the threshold the whole
 * pass is one cartographic conversion and an early return.

 * The hull a row published, in the shape the render pass needs.

 * exist and none of them is wrong:
 *
 *  1. `row.hull` — an ALREADY-REDUCED block, the shape this function itself
 *     returns. This is what the bundled dev proxy emits: `vite.config.js`
 *     calls `aisStaticDimensions()` on the AISStream static message and stores
 *     the result whole. Reading it first is not an optimisation, it is the
 *     only lossless path — the alternative was to re-expand the block into
 *     four offsets in the proxy and re-collapse it here, which invents a
 *     `to_stern` the reducer had already consumed. Accepting it costs one
 *     branch; NOT accepting it is a silent total failure, because a row that
 *     carries `hull` carries neither `to_bow` nor `length`, so every contact
 *     falls through to the unmeasured chevron while the proxy is doing its job
 *     correctly. (That is exactly what happened between the proxy landing and
 *     this branch: 100 % hollow arrows, and an honest shape saying so.)
 *  2. the four AIS offsets, the primary WIRE form.
 *  3. `length` / `beam`, read as a fallback because `VITE_AIS_LIVE_API_URL` can
 *     point at a proxy that has already reduced them, and a proxy that hands
 *     over a derived length has still MEASURED it. The antenna offsets stay
 *     null in that case — a centred hull is an approximation the outline
 *     builder already documents, whereas a fabricated antenna position would
 *     be a claim.
 *
 * The block in (1) is re-validated rather than trusted: a proxy is allowed to
 * be wrong, and a non-finite or non-positive length must reach the render pass
 * as "not reported" and not as a zero-length ship.

 *
 * ── The B2 choice, stated ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * B2 offers two legal ways to put a quantity on the size channel of a globe:
 * constant pixels, or world units. This regime takes **world units**, and it is
 * the case the rule calls legitimate: a ship is a physical object, so drawing
 * it at its physical length means it shrinks with distance exactly as the thing
 * itself does. Nothing is composed on top — no `scaleByDistance`, no thematic
 * multiplier. The chevron above it takes the other branch (constant pixels),
 * and the two never overlap in what they claim: the hull says *how big*, the
 * chevron says *where and which family*.
 *
 * ── What is refused, and why each refusal is counted ────────────────────────
 *
 * · No published length or no published beam → no hull. A hull needs both, and
 *   a fabricated width on a published length is rule A1 in geometry.
 * · No published heading and no course over ground → no hull. A hull is a
 *   directional object; drawn pointing north by default it would assert an
 *   orientation nobody measured. These are counted separately in the stats
 *   because "we know its size but not which way it points" is a distinct fact
 *   from "we know nothing".
 * · Beyond the cap → not drawn, and declared as `n / N` (rule A5). The
 *   selection criterion is DISTANCE TO THE CAMERA, nearest first, which is the
 *   only criterion a reader of a port view can predict.
