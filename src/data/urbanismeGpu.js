/**
 * Géoportail de l'urbanisme — what may legally be built here, and what the
 * state has already encumbered this ground with.
 *
 * THE MOST DECISION-CHANGING LAYER OF THE SIX, AND THE LEAST LOOKED AT. A
 * listing shows the flat. It does not show that the car park opposite is zoned
 * for construction, that an airport noise-exposure plan covers the address, or
 * that a railway protection strip runs under the balcony. All three are
 * public, drawable, and read today — if at all — one PDF at a time.
 *
 * IT DRAWS THE BLOCK, NOT THE DOT. Below {@link GPU_BOX_MAX_ALTITUDE_M} the
 * zoning half is asked for over a BOX around what the camera is looking at, so
 * the answer on screen is the neighbourhood's zoning rather than one polygon
 * under the operator's feet. That is the layer's actual question — "could the
 * car park opposite become twenty-five metres of construction?" is about the
 * plot OPPOSITE — and a point query cannot answer it. Higher up it falls back
 * to the point, which is still correct and much cheaper. Measured on
 * 2026-09-01 at the 0.02° ceiling: Paris 52 zones and 221 KB against 122 KB
 * for the point, Ustaritz 55 zones and 170 KB against 17 KB.
 *
 * THE SERVITUDE HALF STAYS A POINT IN BOTH REGIMES, and the measurement is
 * why: one 390 m box over Lyon's Presqu'île answers 210 easement features and
 * 2.3 MB. At the zoning ceiling the full-box regime cost 4 MB upstream, 1.8 MB
 * on the wire and 1 182 entities against the hybrid's 888 KB, 506 KB and 218 —
 * four times the payload for the half of the answer a point already gets
 * right. "What reaches this address" is the right question for an easement.
 *
 * THE ZONE IS FILLED, AND THAT IS NOT DECORATION. It was drawn as a bare
 * outline until an operator looked at Ustaritz and asked how one house could
 * be in two PLU zones at once. An outline has no inside: nothing on screen
 * says which side of the line the rule applies to, and when two lines run near
 * each other a building between them belongs to both as far as the eye can
 * tell. A translucent wash answers the question the line only posed, and it
 * answers it in the one place a reader is looking — the ground under the
 * house. The stroke stays on top, because the wash says WHERE and the stroke
 * says EXACTLY WHERE.
 *
 * AND THE ENCLAVES ARE CUT OUT OF IT. `gpuFeed.js` kept outer rings only until
 * this branch, on the reasoning that a hole in an outline is invisible. It is
 * invisible; a hole in a FILL is the whole point. Measured at Ustaritz on
 * 2026-09-01: the `UB` zone returned for the village centre is one polygon
 * with two interior rings — the school (`UE`, 6 646 m²) and the industrial
 * estate (`UYc`, 50 686 m²). Filled without its holes, UB is a solid blob that
 * paints 57 332 m² of ground with a rule that does not apply to it. That is
 * how a house ends up in two zones, and it was ours, not the register's.
 *
 * THE FILL IS WEIGHTED BY WHAT THE FAMILY DOES TO A VIEW, see
 * {@link zoneFillAlpha}. Never above a third: an orthophoto that cannot be
 * read under the rule is not a map of the rule.
 *
 * SERVITUDES STAY LINES, AND THE LINES ARE DASHED. They are not zoning, and a
 * solid stroke would say they were. They are also the wrong size to fill:
 * measured, one `pm1` technological-risk envelope is 759 polygons and 50 669
 * vertices spanning kilometres, so a wash of it tints the entire view rather
 * than a plot. Dashed is the ordinary cartographic convention for a rule laid
 * OVER ground rather than a property of the ground, and it survives being
 * drawn on top of the zone fill.
 *
 * WHY THERE IS A MARKER AT THE SCAN POINT. Clamped polylines are drawn as
 * ground primitives and are NOT pickable in this scene — measured: 62 vertices
 * of one servitude ring on screen, `scene.pick` returning null at every one of
 * them. Widening the stroke did not change it. But aiming at a hairline was
 * always the wrong interaction anyway: a zoning rule and an easement describe
 * the GROUND UNDER THE ADDRESS, not a particular line on a map. So the layer
 * plants one marker at the point it scanned, carrying the whole answer, and the
 * outlines stay as the context that shows how far each rule reaches.
 *
 * AND THEN THE WHOLE GROUND IS THE ANSWER, NOT THE MARKER. One marker per scan
 * makes the map's own colours ornamental: the reader can see that the plot
 * opposite is magenta and still has to fly the camera over it to be told what
 * magenta means there, because the only thing carrying words is a 26-pixel
 * glyph somewhere else. So a click ANYWHERE on this layer's ground — the wash,
 * the outlines, the bare globe between them — is read as a question about that
 * spot and answered from the map already in hand: see {@link gpuAnswerAt}. No
 * request, no wait, and it works on the plot opposite, which is the plot this
 * layer exists for.
 *
 * THE ANSWER IS READ OFF THE DRAWN SHAPES, AND WITHIN 30 M OF THE MARKER IT IS
 * NOT. Those shapes are decimated by up to 96%, and the module's own rule is
 * that a simplified outline must never be what decides which rule applies to a
 * house: measured at Ustaritz, the scan point APIcarto itself answers `UB` for
 * falls OUTSIDE the decimated `UB` ring. At the scan point the register has
 * already answered — `atPoint` for the zoning, and every servitude returned by
 * construction, since that half is always a point query — so within
 * {@link GPU_REGISTER_RADIUS_M} the register's answer is used and the geometry
 * is not consulted. Further out the drawn map answers, and the card says that
 * the outline it answered from is simplified.
 *
 * DRAWN AS SIMPLIFIED SHAPES, AND SAYING SO. The measured upstream is
 * 1,396,720 bytes for one point, one feature of which is 759 polygons and
 * 50,669 vertices published to the millimetre. `gpuFeed.js` decimates that by
 * 96%, and every shape carries `simplified` so nothing here is mistaken for a
 * surveyed limit. The regulation URL rides along on each servitude: this layer
 * points at the legal document, it is not one.
