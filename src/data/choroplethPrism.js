// src/data/choroplethPrism.js
/**
 * The départemental PRISM — the shared grammar that replaces a flat count
 * choropleth with a two-variable volume: HEIGHT carries the absolute count,
 * HUE carries the rate.
 *
 * This module is pure arithmetic and strings. No Cesium, no DOM, no fetch, so
 * it runs identically in the browser, in the Vite proxy and under
 * `node --test`. It draws nothing: it is the SPECIFICATION four layers
 * (`irve-fr`, `schools-fr`, `sup-fr`, `franceEnergy`) implement, and the place
 * where the arbitrations below are written down once instead of four times.
 *
 * ── The defect this replaces ────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Three layers paint an ABSOLUTE COUNT as a colour fill on the same 96
 * département polygons: charge points (`irve-fr`, 227 → 10 539), schools
 * (`schools-fr`), students (`sup-fr`, 2.96 M over ~30 cities). The corpus names
 * this exact figure twice, in capitals:
 *
 *   « Représentation d'une variable quantitative absolue en aplats de couleur
 *     — NOP !!!! »
 *   « L'une des erreurs sémiologiques les plus courantes que l'on peut
 *     rencontrer sur le géoweb. »
 *
 * Each of the three headers argues its choice, and the argument is real: the
 * density alternative covers a factor of 2 300 and leaves 95 départements
 * indistinguishable. But the alternative they compare against is always
 * "count fill vs. rate fill" — one channel, two candidates, one loser. On a
 * globe there is a second channel and it is empty.
 *
 * ── The channel that was empty ──────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `extrudedHeight` appeared ONCE in the whole of `src/data` when this module was
 * written — `bdtopoBuildings.js:637`, and there it is a building's real height,
 * not a thematic variable. (Recounted 2026-09-03 after the four prism layers
 * landed: seven writes and five clears across `bdtopoBuildings`, `sitadelFrance`,
 * `localGeojson` and the four consumers of this module. The sentence above is
 * kept in the past tense because it is the argument for this file existing, not
 * a live census — `docs/REPRESENTATION.md` holds the current one.)
 * CARTOGRAPHY B2 already prescribes the fix and nobody had read it as one:
 *
 *   « Le quantitatif doit migrer sur un canal orthogonal à la profondeur :
 *     anneau de rayon fixe en pixels, valeur/luminance, ou HAUTEUR
 *     D'EXTRUSION lue contre un guide vertical. »
 *
 * ── A3 · what each channel carried, and what it carries now ─────────────────
 *
 *   FILL HUE   before: the absolute count, in quantile bins (B1 violation).
 *              now:    the RATE — density, share, per-capita — a ratio, which
 *                      is the one thing a colour fill is allowed to say.
 *   HEIGHT     before: nothing. The axis existed and was unused.
 *              now:    the absolute count, linearly, against a common datum.
 *   FILL ALPHA before: a compositing correction. `choroplethAlpha.js` runs a
 *              DESCENDING ladder so that the ramp's own lightness ordering
 *              survives being blended over unknown imagery.
 *              now:    CONSTANT — see {@link PRISM_BODY_ALPHA}. A prism body is
 *                      composited over the sky and over other prisms, not over
 *                      the basemap, so the correction has no object here and
 *                      alpha stops encoding anything. Do NOT import the
 *                      `choroplethAlpha` ladder into a prism: it would put a
 *                      second, mismatched ordering on a channel that now
 *                      carries none.
 *
 * ── C1 · the domain is frozen, and it is not the sample ─────────────────────
 *
 * {@link createPrismScale} takes `domainMax` as a literal the layer measured
 * ONCE and published in its own header. It is never re-derived from what is on
 * screen and never from what a poll happened to return, so the same
 * département is the same height in every session and every share link. The
 * price is stated rather than hidden: a value above the frozen domain is
 * CLIPPED to the top of the scale, {@link prismRow} flags it, and
 * {@link prismLegend} publishes the count of clipped units — A5.
 *
 * Note what freezing the domain removes. `franceDepartements.countBins()`
 * recomputes quantiles from the rows in hand on every load; a poll that lost a
 * stripe silently moves every boundary. A frozen `domainMax` cannot do that.
 *
 * ── The height scale: linear, and why not sqrt by default ───────────────────
 *
 * The default mode is `'linear'`. Three reasons, in order of weight:
 *
 * 1. The mark is a LENGTH, not an area. The square-root correction belongs to
 *    proportional CIRCLES, where the mark grows in two dimensions and the eye
 *    judges area — which is why `edfPowerPlants.js` is right to write "l'aire
 *    plutôt que le rayon porte les mégawatts". A prism's base is fixed by the
 *    département; only the height moves; the height grows in one dimension.
 *    Applying the circle correction here corrects a bias that is not present,
 *    and it under-states every ratio in the data.
 * 2. Length is the visual variable the eye judges best — the top of Cleveland
 *    & McGill's ranking, above angle, area and colour — but only if the ruler
 *    is uniform. A square-root ruler puts its ticks at 100 %, 25 % and 1 % of
 *    the domain for the tops at 100 %, 50 % and 10 % of the height. Nobody
 *    reads that off a map without the legend in hand, which defeats D1's whole
 *    point (a legend one can decode WITH the map, not instead of it).
 * 3. It is the mode that survives a screenshot. Linear heights can be compared
 *    with a ruler on a printed frame; a compressed scale cannot.
 *
 * `'sqrt'` is provided and must be DECLARED, because there is one case where
 * linear stops saying anything: a domain whose dynamic range exceeds roughly
 * 1 : 30, at which point the bottom of the distribution sits under the visible
 * floor and {@link PRISM_MIN_HEIGHT_M} does all the work — which is a lie by
 * flooring, not a scale. `irve-fr` runs 227 → 10 539 (1 : 46; Lozère lands at
 * 2.6 km linear, under the 4 km floor). `sup-fr` is worse by an order of
 * magnitude. A layer that chooses `'sqrt'` gets {@link prismLegend} to say so
 * in the height blurb, in French, unprompted.
 *
 * ── The hard problem: same height, different base areas ─────────────────────
 *
 * A prism is a VOLUME, and volume = base × height. Measured on this repo's own
 * bundled geometry (`local_data/france_departements/departements.geojson`, 96
 * features, spherical area per ring): Paris is 104 km², Gironde is 10 077 km²
 * — a factor of 97. At equal count and equal height, the Gironde prism has
 * ninety-seven times the Paris prism's mass. If the eye reads mass, it reads
 * the count wrong, and it reads it wrong in a direction correlated with
 * rurality. This is a real semiological defect and it is not solved by
 * pretending the reader looks only at the top face.
 *
 * Three ways out were weighed:
 *
 * (a) NORMALISE THE HEIGHT by the base area, so volume ∝ count. Rejected, and
 *     not narrowly: h ∝ count / area IS the density. It does not fix the
 *     misreading, it silently changes which variable is drawn, and it puts a
 *     ratio back on the size channel that B1 reserves for the absolute.
 *
 * (b) NORMALISE THE BASE — one fixed-radius column per département, at its
 *     centroid. Exact (volume ∝ count), and it is the honest 3D bar chart. It
 *     is rejected as the DEFAULT because it stops being a map: the polygon,
 *     the only thing that makes this a choropleth rather than a chart on a
 *     backdrop, disappears; and eight columns collide in Île-de-France, which
 *     is precisely where the values are. It stays on the table as the escape
 *     hatch for a domain concentrated in a few points — `sup-fr`, where
 *     REPRESENTATION.md already proposes a Dorling.
 *
 * (c) KEEP THE POLYGON BASE, KEEP THE HEIGHT LINEAR, AND MAKE THE MISREADING
 *     CHECKABLE. This is what ships, and it rests on the bivariate pairing:
 *     the single question a volume misreading produces — "is this pile big
 *     because the territory is big?" — is answered by the COLOUR of the same
 *     prism, because the colour is the rate. A wide rural département with a
 *     large count reads TALL AND PALE. Paris reads TALL AND SATURATED. The two
 *     variables are not decoration for each other; the second is the audit of
 *     the first.
 *
 *     Two rendering conventions carry the rest, and the four layers owe them:
 *     the reading instrument is the TOP EDGE against a common datum, so the
 *     body is translucent ({@link PRISM_BODY_ALPHA}) and the top face and
 *     silhouette are near-opaque ({@link PRISM_TOP_ALPHA}); and every prism
 *     starts at the SAME base ({@link PRISM_BASE_HEIGHT_M}), so tops are
 *     comparable.
 *
 *     WHAT THIS COSTS, stated plainly: a reader who reads mass rather than the
 *     top edge over-reads large rural départements. The prism does not remove
 *     the areal bias of a choropleth — it moves it from the fill to the volume
 *     — but unlike the flat fill it hands the reader a second channel with
 *     which to catch it, and {@link prismLegend} writes the caveat on the map.
 *
 * ── Calibration: how tall, and how that was computed ────────────────────────
 *
 * The frustum: Cesium's default `fov` is 60° and it is the HORIZONTAL angle
 * whenever aspect > 1 — verified in the bundled build, `fovy` is derived as
 * `2·atan(tan(fov/2) / aspect)` (`Build/CesiumUnminified/index.js:197525`) and
 * the 60° default is set at `:212101`. On a 1600 × 1000 viewport that gives
 * fovy = 39.68° = 0.6928 rad, i.e. 1 443.8 px per radian vertically.
 *
 * The altitude: the three count layers enter their national regime on a view
 * latitude span ≥ 9.5° (metropolitan France is 9.8° tall). A 9.5° span is
 * 1 057 km on the ground, and 2·d·tan(fovy/2) = 1 057 km solves to
 * d ≈ 1 465 km. So "national altitude" is ~1 500 km, and that is the distance
 * everything below is calibrated at. France is then 929 px wide in a 1600 px
 * frame — the whole country, filling the view.
 *
 * At d = 1 500 km, apparent height = 1 443.8 · 2·atan(h / 2d):
 *
 *     h = 120 km  →  115.4 px   the tallest prism
 *     h =  60 km  →   57.7 px   half the domain
 *     h =   4 km  →    3.9 px   the floor
 *     Mont Blanc (4 808 m)  →  4.6 px   ← the whole relief of France
 *
 * {@link PRISM_MAX_HEIGHT_M} = 120 km. Upper bound: 115 px is 11.5 % of the
 * frame height and 1.7× the on-screen width of an average département (70 km,
 * 67 px), which is a relief the eye sorts without effort; much taller and the
 * front row starts occluding the back row, which on a north-up oblique view
 * means Occitanie hiding Auvergne. Lower bound: below ~80 km the spread between
 * the median and the top of the domain falls under 40 px and the map is a flat
 * fill again. 120 km also sits just above the Kármán line, which is a feature
 * rather than an accident — 25× the highest ground in France means no reader
 * can mistake a thematic volume for terrain.
 *
 * {@link PRISM_MIN_HEIGHT_M} = 4 km, i.e. 3.9 px at national altitude and
 * 14.4 px at a regional 400 km. This is the A1 floor: a département measured
 * at 1 must not be confusable with a département measured at nothing. It costs
 * 3.3 % of the scale — every value under 3.3 % of `domainMax` is drawn at the
 * same height — and that is the sole reason `'sqrt'` exists.
 *
 * All of it is recomputable: {@link prismApparentPx} is the function these
 * figures came out of, and the test file re-derives every number above.
 *
 * ── Rendering notes for the four layers ─────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * ① AN EXTRUDED POLYGON CANNOT CLASSIFY. Verified in the bundled Cesium:
 *   `GroundGeometryUpdater.prototype._isOnTerrain` returns false as soon as
 *   `extrudedHeight` is defined (`index.js:148334-148336`). The entity is then
 *   built as an ordinary `Primitive`, and `polygon.classificationType` —
 *   which the three layers set today (`irveFrance.js:1117`) — is read into
 *   `_classificationTypeProperty` and never used. It does not throw. It stops
 *   mattering, SILENTLY. Do not keep setting it and assume it still works.
 *
 *   Consequence: the fill no longer drapes on terrain, nor on the
 *   photorealistic 3D tiles. That is ACCEPTABLE at national altitude, and it is
 *   more than acceptable — it is the correct behaviour:
 *
 *   · Scale. The whole relief of France is 4.8 km against a 120 km prism: 4 %
 *     of the mark's own height, 4.6 px against 115 px on screen.
 *   · Comparability, which is the real argument. Clamping the base to terrain
 *     would start the Savoie prism 2 km higher than the Landes prism, so its
 *     TOP would be 2 km higher at equal count. A height scale read against a
 *     common datum cannot afford a base that moves with the relief. Leaving
 *     the base on the ellipsoid ({@link PRISM_BASE_HEIGHT_M} = 0) is what makes
 *     the tops comparable at all. Terrain will poke through the bottom of an
 *     Alpine prism; that is the correct trade and it is visible, not hidden.
 *   · `perPositionHeight` MUST stay false, for the same reason.
 *
 * ② THE BATCHED-GROUNDPRIMITIVE COLOUR BUG DOES NOT FOLLOW US. A batched
 *   `GroundPrimitive` colours each instance by its bounding RECTANGLE, not by
 *   its polygon — documented in CARTOGRAPHY and paid for by this repo already.
 *   An extruded polygon classifies nothing, has its own geometry, and takes
 *   per-instance colour exactly. Going 3D REMOVES this constraint instead of
 *   inheriting it.
 *
 * ③ THE PRISM GETS AN OUTLINE, WHICH THE FLAT FILL COULD NEVER HAVE. Cesium
 *   force-disables `outline` with a one-time warning whenever a polygon is on
 *   terrain (`index.js:61110-61113`). Off terrain, the outline is legal — so
 *   the silhouette and the top edge that the reading depends on are drawable.
 *
 * ④ THE PRISM IS AN OBLIQUE SIGN. At nadir a vertical extrusion projects to
 *   nearly nothing but parallax, so the height is unreadable straight down. The
 *   fallback is not a failure: the colour is still exact at nadir, because hue
 *   is the one variable perspective does not distort (CARTOGRAPHY F4). A layer
 *   that wants the height read should say so — the same way `cctv.js` earns its
 *   oblique frusta.
 *
 * ⑤ FLAT CASES ARE STILL DRAWN, WITH THEIR OWN SIGNS. See {@link prismRow}:
 *   "no count" is an empty hatched footprint, "measured zero" is a filled flat
 *   footprint with a solid outline, and they must not look alike (A1/D3).
