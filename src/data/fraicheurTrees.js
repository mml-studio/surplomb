/**
 * @module fraicheurTrees
 *
 * The 219 432 trees of Paris, and the one regime that can honestly draw them.
 *
 * `les-arbres` is the other half of `fraicheur-fr`: the green-space register in
 * `fraicheurFeed.js` measures how much canopy each park has, and this file is
 * the canopy itself, tree by tree, with the species, the height, the girth, the
 * development stage and the 183 the city calls remarkable.
 *
 * ── The regime, and why it is a bbox query and not a mesh ──────────────────
 *
 * The obvious move is `geoMeshThinning.js`, which every other big French point
 * set in this repo uses. It is the wrong tool here and the measurement says so
 * plainly. Thinning selects a representative per grid cell **from rows the
 * client already holds**, and the client can never hold these: measured
 * 2026-09-01 through the portal's own `exports/geojson`, the whole file is
 * **18 611 450 B gzipped on the wire, 111 448 515 B decoded, 39.7 s**. Moving
 * the thinning into the proxy does not help — it would mean buying 111 MB on
 * every cold cache to publish six hundred dots. And the dots would say nothing:
 * one representative per cell across a city 105 km² wide is a picture of "Paris
 * has trees", which is not a finding.
 *
 * So the viewport asks, and it asks in the right order. `in_bbox(geo_point_2d,
 * S,W,N,E)` works on `records` AND on `exports/geojson`, and `exports/*` is
 * subject to NEITHER of the two caps that make `records` useless here — 100 rows
 * per page (`limit=101` → HTTP 400) and 10 000 rows of paging in total
 * (`limit=100&offset=9999` → HTTP 400, *"Invalid value for sum of offset + limit
 * API parameter: 10099 was found but <= 10000 is expected."*). Measured on a
 * 0.02° × 0.03° central box: 5 287 trees, **231 618 B on the wire, 1 690 170 B
 * decoded, 0.65 s**; projected by this module and re-served, **119 302 B
 * gzipped** — the register publishes 16 decimal places of longitude, and five
 * of them survive the projection.
 *
 * ── The probe is the gate, and it costs 55 bytes ───────────────────────────
 *
 * Before the download there is a question worth asking: how many trees are
 * actually in this box? `records?where=in_bbox(…)&limit=0&select=count(*) as n`
 * answers it in **55 bytes and 0.16 s**, measured. That is the difference
 * between this layer and its neighbour: `cadastre-fr` has to buy an Api Carto
 * answer to discover it was truncated, and this one knows the price before it
 * pays. Over budget, nothing is fetched and the true count is printed.
 *
 * ── Where the budget comes from ────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Every number in this chain was measured, and they chain:
 *   • the client asks for at most {@link FRAICHEUR_TREE_MAX_BOX_DEG} = 0.016°
 *     around the focus point, which is ~1.78 km of latitude and ~1.17 km of
 *     longitude at 48.86° N;
 *   • `snapBoxOutward` at a 0.002° cache grid moves each edge out by up to one
 *     step, so what reaches the portal is at most 0.020° on either axis;
 *   • the densest GRID-ALIGNED 0.020° × 0.020° window anywhere in the register
 *     holds **10 571 trees** — every aligned 10 × 10-cell window scored over
 *     all 219 432 published coordinates, downloaded whole through
 *     `exports/json?select=geo_point_2d` (15 737 120 B decoded), not sampled.
 *     It is 48.816,2.346 → 48.836,2.366, the 13e around the Parc de Choisy, and
 *     the live count probe on that exact box answers 10 571 to the tree. The
 *     proxy's own ceiling of {@link FRAICHEUR_TREE_REQUEST_MAX_BOX_DEG} = 0.022°
 *     admits an 11 × 11 window, whose worst case is **12 269**;
 *   • so {@link FRAICHEUR_TREE_BUDGET} is 12 500, just above the widest box the
 *     PROXY will accept rather than above the widest the client will ask for.
 *     A budget set on the client ceiling would have been 10 000 and would have
 *     refused the 13e — the one arrondissement with the most trees in it.
 *     Worst-case payload at the budget: about 282 KB gzipped, from the 22.57 B
 *     per tree measured on the 5 287-tree central box (1 071 812 B of JSON,
 *     119 316 B gzipped).
 *
 * For scale, the same probe over the whole city (48.815,2.25 → 48.905,2.42)
 * returns 183 025, and a 0.06° × 0.11° box measured **4 512 069 B on the wire /
 * 31 397 297 B decoded in 8.5 s**. That is the box this gate exists to refuse.
 *
 * ── What the drawing is careful about ──────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * • **`hauteurenm = 0` is "not measured", encoded as a number.** It is on
 *   19 407 of the 219 432 trees, and `circonferenceencm = 0` on 16 250 — the
 *   same trees, almost exactly: **16 123 carry both zeros**, so only 3 284 have
 *   a height without a girth and 127 the reverse. A layer that scaled a dot by
 *   height would draw 19 407 seedlings where the register meant silence. Here
 *   they get their own colour and the minimum size, and the legend says how
 *   many.
 * • **The top of the scale is 25 m, not 65 m.** The tallest tree published is
 *   65 m and there are exactly two over 40 m; the 99th percentile of the
 *   200 025 measured heights is 25 m and the median is 9 m. A ceiling at the
 *   maximum would spend the whole visible range on two dots.
 * • **`stadedeveloppement` contains a corrupt value and it is not rare.**
 *   `"Jeune (arbre)Adulte"` — two states concatenated upstream — is on **41 526
 *   trees, 18.9% of the register**, and it is on the very first row of the
 *   central bbox (idbase 216091). It is NOT silently mapped to either state; it
 *   gets its own label that says the register is broken here.
 * • **`remarquable` is three-state text.** `"NON"` 205 726, null 13 523,
 *   `"OUI"` 183. The null is not "no", and the 183 are the only trees the city
 *   itself singles out, so they are the one thing this layer draws bigger than
 *   the data alone would justify.
 * • **43 194 of these trees are not in a Paris arrondissement.** The
 *   `arrondissement` column has 25 values and five of them are not `PARIS NNE
 *   ARRDT`: SEINE-SAINT-DENIS 12 138, BOIS DE VINCENNES 11 755, VAL-DE-MARNE
 *   7 600, BOIS DE BOULOGNE 6 394, HAUTS-DE-SEINE 5 307. The two bois ARE Paris;
 *   the other three are the city's cemeteries beyond the périphérique. A "trees
 *   in Paris" count that trusts this column is wrong by 11%.
 * • **Half of Paris's trees are in the street.** `domanialite = "Alignement"`
 *   on **110 157 of 219 432, 50.20%** — against 56 427 in a garden and 31 982 in
 *   a cemetery. The shade this city actually has is mostly on the pavement, and
 *   the pavement is not on anybody's heatwave list.
 *
 * Dependency-free and side-effect-free (no Cesium, no DOM) so it runs
 * identically in the browser, in the Vite dev-server proxy, and under
 * `node --test`.
