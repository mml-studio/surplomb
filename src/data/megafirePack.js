/*
 * MEGAFIRE PACK — the shared vocabulary of the Gironde 2026 reconstruction.
 *
 * Two callers, one file, so they cannot drift:
 *   - scripts/build-gironde-megafire-2026.mjs PROJECTS Copernicus EMS EMSR899,
 *     EFFIS and NASA FIRMS into src/data/local_data/gironde_megafire_2026/.
 *   - src/data/girondeMegafire.js READS the shipped fields back to draw the
 *     five perimeters, the fronts, the flames and the hotspot replay.
 *
 * Everything here is pure — no Cesium, no fs, no network — so the build script
 * and the browser both import it as-is. Same contract as ./damsPack.js and
 * ./airportsPack.js next door, and for the same reason: a field the build stops
 * emitting has to become a failing test, not a blank frame on the globe.
 *
 * ── WHAT THIS LAYER IS, AND WHY IT IS NOT `local-firms` ─────────────────────
 *
 * `local-firms` is a LIVE feed: NASA FIRMS VIIRS detections from the last 24
 * hours, anywhere on Earth, empty without a server-side key. This is a CLOSED
 * event: one fire, eighteen days, every byte already on disk. They share a
 * sensor and nothing else — one answers "what is burning now", the other "what
 * happened here, and in what order". Per the repo's one-subject-one-row rule
 * they would merge if either covered the other. Neither does: switching
 * `local-firms` on today over Gironde draws nothing at all, because the fire
 * has been out since 1 August 2026.
 *
 * ── THE EVENT ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Fire reported at Saumos (Gironde) on 22 July 2026 at 18:00 UTC. Copernicus
 * EMS Rapid Mapping was activated 54 minutes later, at 18:54, by the French
 * COGIC — activation EMSR899, one AOI, named "Le Porge" for the commune the
 * delineation is centred on. The fire ran west-north-west into the pine forest
 * behind the Bassin d'Arcachon, forced the evacuation of the Cap-Ferret
 * peninsula, and was declared fixed in the first days of August. EFFIS closes
 * its perimeter on 1 August 2026 at 12:44.
 *
 * It is the largest French forest fire since 1949. For scale, on the same EFFIS
 * layer and the same 1° box, the three big Gironde fires of 2022 measure
 * 13 116 ha (Landiras/Louchats), 7 566 ha (Belin-Béliet) and 5 806 ha
 * (La Teste-de-Buch) — 26 488 ha together, against this one polygon's 37 191.
 *
 * ── THREE INSTITUTIONS, THREE ANSWERS, AND WHY ALL THREE SHIP ───────────────
 *
 * The same fire is published at three different sizes:
 *
 *     31 602 ha   Copernicus EMS, delineation MONIT02, 29 July 14:07 UTC
 *     37 191 ha   EFFIS, final burnt-area polygon, commune "Porge"
 *     47 910 ha   GDACS, alert WF1029628, Red
 *
 * They are not in conflict; they are three different questions. Copernicus
 * delineates what a 0.3 m optical image shows INSIDE a tasked AOI on a given
 * date. EFFIS runs an automatic MODIS/Sentinel burnt-area detection with no AOI
 * and no deadline, so it keeps growing after the mappers stop. GDACS scores an
 * ALERT footprint, deliberately generous because its job is to warn.
 *
 * This pack ships the Copernicus figure on the timeline (it is the one with an
 * image and an hour attached) and the EFFIS figure as the closing frame, and
 * the layer names both. Picking one and hiding the others would be the only
 * dishonest option available here.
 *
 * ── THE 0.19 % THAT PROVES THE GEOMETRY IS THE PUBLISHER'S ──────────────────
 *
 * Every hectare count on screen is Copernicus's own, read out of the activation
 * API — never re-derived from the simplified drawing. But the raw geometry was
 * measured against those figures once, before any simplification, as the check
 * that the right rings were being read (outer minus holes, and not outer
 * alone). On all five products the shoelace area lands 0.18 % to 0.20 % BELOW
 * the published hectares:
 *
 *     DEL_PRODUCT    5 765 ha measured    5 775.4 published   -0.18 %
 *     DEL_MONIT01   24 812 ha            24 857.4            -0.18 %
 *     GRA_PRODUCT   28 228 ha            28 284.7            -0.20 %
 *     DEL_MONIT02   31 541 ha            31 602.4            -0.19 %
 *     GRA_MONIT01   31 266 ha            31 326.5            -0.19 %
 *
 * A constant bias, not a scatter — it is this file's flat-earth projection
 * ({@link MEGAFIRE_M_PER_DEG_LON}), not a disagreement with Copernicus. The
 * first attempt ignored interior rings and came out 10 % to 13 % HIGH with no
 * such pattern, which is how the hole-reading bug was caught. `holes` are
 * therefore not decorative: 1 832 polygons on MONIT02 carve out 4 565 ha of
 * unburnt ground, and a version that dropped them would draw a fire 14 % bigger
 * than the one that happened.
 *
 * ── THE TIMESTAMPS ARE UTC, AND THAT WAS CHECKED, NOT ASSUMED ───────────────
 *
 * Copernicus publishes `acquisitionTime` as a bare string. The Sentinel-2 frame
 * of 26 July is stamped 10:56, and Sentinel-2's descending node is 10:30 local
 * solar time — over this AOI (longitude -1.03°) that is ~10:34 UTC, and real
 * overpasses of south-west France land near 10:50-11:00 UTC. Local French
 * summer time would put it at 08:56 UTC, two hours before the satellite is
 * anywhere near. So the strings are UTC, and this pack stores them with an
 * explicit `Z`.
