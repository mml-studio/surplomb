/**
 * @module gbfsFeeds
 *
 * Pure catalog, parsing and REDUNDANCY logic for French shared mobility —
 * the GBFS feeds published on the Point d'Accès National
 * (`transport.data.gouv.fr`): vélos en libre-service, trottinettes, scooters
 * and autopartage.
 *
 * WHAT MAKES THIS SOURCE AWKWARD, and what most of this file is about:
 *
 *   1. **The catalog double-counts.** One operator publishes the same feed
 *      under several dataset entries — Dott appears as "France", "Paris",
 *      "Lyon", "Bordeaux", "OL Vallée" and "Bourgoin-Jaillieu" pointing at one
 *      URL; Vélam Amiens is listed five times. Measured 2026-08-27: 8 groups,
 *      22 catalog resources, one real system each.
 *   2. **The same system appears at several GBFS versions.** Naolib Nantes is
 *      published at `/gbfs/v2/` and `/gbfs/v3/` — different URLs, identical
 *      121 stations.
 *   3. **The same system appears on different HOSTS.** Vélo'v Lyon is served
 *      both by JCDecaux (`api.cyclocity.fr`) and by the Métropole
 *      (`download.data.grandlyon.com`) — 464 stations, a 100% match. No URL
 *      comparison can catch this.
 *   4. **Four systems are already drawn by another layer.** Vélib', Vélo'v,
 *      vélÔToulouse and Le Vélo (TBM) ship in `bikeshare.js`.
 *
 * So identity here is NOT a URL and NOT a name. It is the SET OF PLACES a
 * system reports — see {@link coordSignature} and {@link containment}. That is
 * the only test that survives all four cases, and it is a measurement rather
 * than a naming convention someone has to keep tidy.
 *
 * WITH ONE CORRECTION THAT THE DATA FORCED. Paris requires free-floating
 * operators to park in municipal bays, and every operator republishes that one
 * set of bays as its own `station_information`. Voi Paris and Dott Paris
 * therefore share 96.6% of their "station" positions while being entirely
 * different fleets — the first build marked one as a duplicate of the other.
 * Shared public infrastructure does not identify an operator, so:
 *
 *   - a system with a free-floating fleet is identified by its VEHICLES, not
 *     by the bays it is told to park in;
 *   - a positional match is only accepted as proof of duplication when the two
 *     systems share a publisher host, or when BOTH are purely docked (a dock
 *     network is its operator's own infrastructure — which is what lets Vélo'v
 *     be recognised across `api.cyclocity.fr` and `download.data.grandlyon.com`).
 *
 * An identical resolved URL is always proof, whatever the hosts.
 *
 * Dependency-free and side-effect-free so every rule above is unit-testable
 * without a Vite server.
