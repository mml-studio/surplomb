// src/data/cadastreParcelDetail.js — what is ON a parcel, once you have the
// parcel.
//
// The cadastre says where a piece of land is and how big the tax administration
// thinks it is. It says nothing about what stands on it, who lives there, or
// what its address is — and those are the first three questions anyone asks
// after clicking. This module answers them from two other keyless French
// sources and is careful, on every line, about the fact that they are OTHER
// sources: a building is joined to a parcel by geometry here, not by a
// published relation, and the card says so rather than implying a register.
//
// Everything here is pure and node-testable. The fetching lives in
// `cadastreParcels.js`.
//
// ── The three traps ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// 1. **A building near a tile edge is in BOTH tiles.** Measured over Paris 16e
//    on 2026-09-01: a naive join of two z15 tiles reported 25 buildings on one
//    parcel where there are 14, and `63QEQKPYJ1V3` appeared three times at
//    2 983, 13 and 5 042 m². Vector tiles carry a buffer, so the same building
//    arrives clipped differently in each tile it touches. Deduplicating on
//    `cleabs` — present on 100% of the 1 202 features in a sampled tile — is
//    not an optimisation, it is the difference between 89% built and 50%.
//
// 2. **The join is geometric, and nobody publishes it.** BD TOPO and the PCI
//    are two products with two lineages; there is no key that says "this
//    building is on that parcel". A footprint centroid inside the parcel is a
//    good rule and a stated one, and it is wrong in both directions at the
//    edges: a building straddling a boundary counts wholly on the side its
//    centre falls, and a courtyard pavilion whose centre lands in the neighbour
//    is lost. The card names the rule so the number is read as a measurement of
//    it rather than as a fact about the land registry.
//
// 3. **The address is the NEAREST one, and its distance says how near.** BAN
//    reverse geocoding answers with an address point and the metres between it
//    and the query. At 7 m that is the building's own number; at 80 m it is the
//    next street. The distance is printed with the address for that reason, and
//    an answer beyond {@link ADDRESS_MAX_DISTANCE_M} is dropped rather than
//    shown, because a wrong address is worse than none on a card whose whole
//    subject is which piece of ground you are looking at.
