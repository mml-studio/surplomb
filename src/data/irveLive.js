/**
 * @module data/irveLive
 *
 * **Ce qui est libre, ici, maintenant** — the join between the register of
 * where the plugs are and the feed that says what they are doing.
 *
 * ── The gap this closes, and why it was open ────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `qualichargeDynamic.js` has decoded the live state of **75 584 points de
 * charge** since 2026-09-07, with its three measured traps — including the one
 * that inflates France's free capacity by 44.4 % if the stale rows are counted.
 * It fed the chronicle and nothing else. `irveFrance.js` draws the sites and
 * says out loud, three times over, that it is not an availability feed.
 *
 * The two could not meet, and the cross-referencing audit (#128) recorded exactly why:
 * QualiCharge is keyed on `id_pdc_itinerance` and publishes **no coordinate at
 * all** (its file is four state columns and a timestamp), while the IRVE
 * layer's viewport query GROUPS its rows to be affordable — 4 017 charge points
 * in central Paris collapse to 469 grouped rows — and `IRVE_GROUP_FIELDS`
 * excludes every per-plug identifier because including one undoes the grouping.
 * So neither side had the other's key.
 *
 * ── The missing table, and what it cost to build ────────────────────────────
 *
 * The consolidated register DOES publish both: one flat export of three columns
 * — `id_pdc_itinerance`, `consolidated_latitude`, `consolidated_longitude` —
 * is **227 007 rows, 8.4 MB, 17 s** against ODRÉ's export endpoint, measured
 * 2026-09-09. That is a national pass, so it is built once on the server, kept
 * on disk and refreshed daily like the register it reads.
 *
 * Joined against the live feed on the same afternoon: **75 311 of 75 584
 * (99.6 %)** of QualiCharge's plugs appear in it. The key works.
 *
 * ── Trap: 9.3 % of plug ids name more than one place ────────────────────────
 *
 * The 227 007 rows carry only **166 908 distinct plug ids**, and **15 594 of
 * them (9.34 %) are published at more than one coordinate**. Measured spread
 * between the coordinates of one id:
 *
 *   under 50 m       9 040 + 5 619 within 500 m
 *   500 m – 5 km       464
 *   5 – 50 km          123
 *   50 – 500 km        210
 *   over 500 km        138   — headed by the literal id `Non concerné`,
 *                              117 coordinates spanning 7 302 km
 *
 * `Non concerné` is the same sentinel `irveFeed.js` documents in its own trap 2
 * for the STATION id; it turns out the plug id has it too. So a plug whose
 * coordinates disagree by more than {@link IRVE_PLACEMENT_TOLERANCE_M} is
 * **refused rather than placed at one of them**: the layer's render unit is the
 * coordinate rounded to five decimals, two coordinates 200 m apart are two
 * marks on the map, and putting a plug's state on one of them is a coin toss
 * printed as a fact.
 *
 * The tolerance costs coverage and the cost is measured, not assumed:
 *
 *   tolerance   plugs placed   QualiCharge joined
 *      20 m       156 484        66 290   87.7 %
 *      50 m       160 339        69 870   92.4 %
 *     100 m       163 900        73 104   96.7 %
 *     200 m       165 380        74 407   98.4 %
 *
 * 50 m is the cut: it is GPS scatter over one car park, and it is under the
 * distance at which the layer would draw two separate sites. The 7.6 % it
 * gives up are plugs whose own register cannot say where they are.
 *
 * ── What this does NOT change ───────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The map still draws INSTALLED CAPACITY and is still not coloured by
 * availability. That contract is in `irveFeed.js`'s header and it stands: a
 * site's colour is its power band, unchanged. What this adds is a LINE ON THE
 * CARD, where a claim can carry its own freshness and its own denominator —
 * which is the only honest place for a number that is true for ten minutes.
 *
 * Pure: no fetch, no DOM, no Cesium, no clock of its own. `vite.config.js`
 * fetches; `irveFrance.js` prints.
