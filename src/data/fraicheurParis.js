/**
 * @module fraicheurParis
 *
 * Îlots de fraîcheur (Paris) — where the city says you can get out of the heat,
 * and how much of that is true at the hour you are asking.
 *
 * `fraicheurFeed.js` reads the three refuge registers and every trap in them;
 * `fraicheurTrees.js` reads the 219 432-tree canopy and the one regime that can
 * honestly draw it. This file is the drawing, and it is the only place the four
 * registers are seen at once.
 *
 * ── FOUR objects, TWO regimes, and the byte counts that settle it ───────────
 *
 * Four registers of four different geometries and four different sizes, and
 * they do not split by zoom — they split by whether the whole thing fits.
 * Measured 2026-09-02 through the exact `exports/geojson` URLs the proxy
 * builds, with the field lists the feed exports:
 *
 *   équipements     535 POINTS      290 718 B decoded
 *   espaces verts   984 POLYGONS  9 216 103 B decoded (584 Polygon + 400 Multi)
 *   fontaines     1 323 POINTS      422 828 B decoded
 *   ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *   projected together by `projectFraicheurRefuges`: 3 451 189 B of JSON,
 *   **643 105 B gzipped** — 2 205 polygon parts and 127 465 vertices.
 *
 *   arbres      219 432 POINTS  111 MB decoded for the whole file.
 *
 * So REGIME 1 is the whole city in one document. 643 KB is what `sup-fr`
 * already ships for the entire national higher-education register (0.62 MB),
 * for a city of 105 km², and the three registers are read TOGETHER — "where can
 * I cool off" is answered by a park, a mister and a tap on the same screen, and
 * three endpoints would make the first paint three round trips. No bbox query,
 * no `geoMeshThinning`, no choropleth: one fetch, and every zoom answered from
 * what the browser already holds.
 *
 * REGIME 2 is the trees, and it cannot be that. The full export is 111 MB
 * decoded; thinning it would mean the proxy buying 111 MB on every cold cache
 * to publish a few hundred dots that only say "Paris has trees". So the
 * viewport asks — `in_bbox(geo_point_2d,S,W,N,E)` on `exports/geojson`, which
 * is subject to neither of the caps `records` carries (100 rows a page, and
 * *"Invalid value for sum of offset + limit API parameter: 10099 was found but
 * <= 10000 is expected."* past record 10 000). Measured on the 0.020° × 0.030°
 * central box: 5 287 trees, 1 690 170 B decoded, 119 316 B gzipped once
 * projected. The gate is ALTITUDE, 1 500 m, for the reason `cadastreFeed.js`
 * measured on this globe: at 240 m over Paris a nadir camera sees 0.0038° of
 * longitude and a 25°-pitched one sees 0.0397°, so a span gate refuses the
 * layer in the street.
 *
 * ── What each channel claims ───────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * FILL on a green space is `indice_veget_sup8m_2024` — the share of the ground
 * under vegetation TALLER THAN 8 m at the 2024 survey, on TWO fixed bands cut
 * at a quarter of the ground. Not area, deliberately: area says how big a park
 * is and this says how much of it casts shade at three in the afternoon, which
 * is the only kind of green a heatwave cares about. The one space that
 * publishes no index at all is grey and is reported in the key's NOTE rather
 * than given a row of its own. The register also publishes `p_vegetation_h`,
 * which is a DIFFERENT number on 903 of the 953 rows carrying both; the card
 * prints both and calls neither a correction.
 *
 * A HOT STROKE around a green space means `canicule_ouverture = "Oui"`, and
 * this is the finding the layer exists to put on a screen: **23 of the 984**.
 * Verified directly against the portal — `where=canicule_ouverture="Oui"`
 * answers `{"total_count": 23}` — because the facet returns THREE `Oui` rows,
 * (Oui,null)=3, (Oui,Non)=11, (Oui,Oui)=9, and adding two of the three gives
 * the 20 an earlier reading of this dataset reported. Nine are also 24 h. And
 * eleven of the twenty-three have `indice_veget_sup8m_2024 = 0`: their median
 * canopy share is 0.0280 against 0.3197 across all 983 spaces that carry the
 * metric, and eight of the eleven are `categorie: "Jardiniere"` — planters,
 * five of them on the Porte Maillot roundabout. Paris's declared heatwave list
 * is, in the majority, traffic islands with nothing to shut. The stroke is
 * 293 polygon parts and 6 536 vertices, so it costs one cheap second batch.
 *
 * COLOUR on an equipment dot is the MECHANISM, folded from the published
 * `type` — and the fold is the point. Read as a `type` list this register looks
 * like a municipal directory that wandered into a climate dataset: 127 ombrières
 * pérennes, 125 lieux de culte, 87 brumisateurs, 65 musées, 39 piscines, 19
 * mairies d'arrondissement, 17 bains-douches, 16 bibliothèques, 13 terrains de
 * boules, 12 ombrières temporaires, 11 baignades extérieures, 4 découverte et
 * initiation. A church is on that list because five metres of limestone holds
 * last night's temperature through the afternoon, and so is a town hall, a
 * museum and a library — 225 of the 535 are cold stone you go inside, the
 * biggest family and the one nobody guesses. Naming the mechanism is what turns
 * the list back into what it is; flattening it to "amenity" is what would hide
 * it. THREE mechanisms and not the register's twelve types, and not the five
 * this file shipped first: you go in (225), you stand under something (156), or
 * there is water (154). The published `type` stays on every card, verbatim.
 *
 * COLOUR on a fountain is `dispo`, which is live: 1 238 OUI against 85 NON, and
 * the 85 carry a stated outage window. Ten of them are outside a window that
 * has already ended, so the card says "the flag has not caught up" rather than
 * "closed".
 *
 * COLOUR on a tree is whether it was MEASURED at all, and SIZE is the published
 * height capped at 25 m. `hauteurenm = 0` is on 19 407 of the 219 432 trees and
 * it means "not surveyed", not "a seedling" — those get the grey band and the
 * minimum size, never a scaled dot.
 *
 * ── The clock is recomputed here, on the browser's minute ──────────────────
 *
 * The proxy folds the pack and its summary at fetch time and caches for an
 * hour. That summary cannot be shown: measured over the real 984 + 535 rows,
 * "open right now" is **757 green spaces and 93 cool spots at 14 h 00 Paris**
 * and **367 and 0 at 01 h 30**. An hour-old answer to "where can I cool off
 * now" is a wrong answer, so this layer re-runs `summarizeFraicheurRefuges` on
 * its own clock whenever the Paris minute changes — 5.0 ms over the whole pack,
 * measured — and `Europe/Paris` and not the browser's zone, because an operator
 * in Denver must not be shown a Paris park as open eight hours after it shut.
 *
 * ── Four registers, four buttons, and a key that follows them ─────────────
 *
 * Every register is drawn at once only if the reader asks for it. With all four
 * on, the key printed 18 rows over a screen where the tree register alone takes
 * up to 12 500 of the ~14 300 dots — 95 % of the ink and three of the rows, for
 * the register that says the least per object — and the 23 heatwave parks this
 * layer exists to show were underneath all of it. So each register has a chip
 * (`FRAICHEUR_REGISTERS`), the key prints only what is drawing, and THE TREES
 * ARE OFF BY DEFAULT: they are also the only register fetched per viewport, so
 * a reader who never asks for them never pays the 1.7 MB either.
 *
 * ── What is NOT drawn, and is counted instead ──────────────────────────────
 *
 * Nothing is placed that was not published: all 535 equipment rows, all 1 323
 * fountains and all 219 432 trees carry a real coordinate, and 984 of 984 green
 * spaces keep at least one usable ring — 22 rings out of 3 439 fall below a
 * triangle at one metre and are dropped and counted, and no space loses all of
 * its geometry that way. **682 of the 984 green spaces publish a timetable
 * whose own validity window had already expired** on the day this was measured,
 * 638 of them the same `du 01/05/26 au 31/08/26`; that is on the row, on the
 * card, and on the same line as the answer it qualifies. 214 spaces and 423
 * cool spots publish no readable weekday hours at all and are reported as
 * `unknown`, never as `closed`.
 *
 * ── One palette, read across three modules ─────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Four registers on one screen means the canopy ramp in `fraicheurFeed.js`, the
 * tree bands in `fraicheurTrees.js` and the equipment and fountain palettes
 * here have to be read as ONE, and two collisions were live before the test
 * that now forbids them: the `mesure` tree band was exactly `#2f8b43`, which is
 * the canopy ramp's 40–55 % fill, so a measured tree standing on any of those
 * 164 parks was painted in its own background; and the residual equipment
 * family was amber, which the 183 remarkable trees own. The rule that replaced
 * them is one line long: **grey `#8a93a6` means "the register did not measure
 * this" and nothing else** — the one space with no canopy index, the 19 407
 * trees with no surveyed height, and any fountain that stops publishing
 * `dispo` — so no other channel may take it, and no two channels may share
 * anything at all.
 *
 * ── Stacking ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The fills are ground-clamped classification polygons over central Paris, and
 * so are `cadastre-fr`'s parcels and `urbanisme-gpu`'s translucent PLU zones.
 * All three on at once is a three-way surface stack, so this layer follows the
 * same rule the others do: the classification surface is derived from the live
 * map stack and re-derived on every `gev:map-stack-changed`, and the fill alpha
 * is low enough (0.34) that a parcel boundary underneath still reads.

/**
 * The four registers, as a filter — and the reason this layer has chips at all.
 *
 * MEASURED ON THE SCREEN, not argued from taste. With every register on, the

 * to 12 500 of the ~14 300 dots: 95 % of the ink and three of the rows, for the
 * one register that says the least per object. The 23 green spaces that declare
 * a heatwave arrangement — the finding this layer exists to put on a screen —
 * were underneath all of it.
 *
 * So the registers became switchable and the key follows the switches: a row is
 * printed only for a register that is actually drawing. One click each way, the
 * same mechanism `edf-power-plants` uses for its filières.
 *
 * TREES ARE OFF BY DEFAULT, and that is the one default that changed. It is not
 * only an ink decision: the tree register is the only one fetched PER VIEWPORT
 * (1.7 MB decoded on the measured central box, against one 643 KB document for
 * the other three), so a reader who never asks for it never pays for it either.
 * `fraicheurTreeLabel` already had the wording for a register that is not

 * and this layer did not was REACH: the tree register is gated at 1 500 m of
 * altitude because 219 432 dots cannot be bought per viewport, so from any view
 * that holds Paris whole the remarkable trees were invisible here and visible
 * there.
 *
 * So the chip carries the reach rather than the row: 183 rows fit in one

   * The row's controls: one chip per register, and the key for what is drawing.
   *
   * ── The key follows the chips, and that is the whole simplification ───────
   *
   * It printed 18 rows — 19 the day a fountain stops publishing `dispo`. Four
   * registers of four geometries, each with its own classification, all painted
   * at once over a photorealistic city, and the reader has one question at a
   * time. Now a register that is off contributes nothing to the key, and the
   * key is 8 rows with the defaults and 11 with the trees on — measured, in
   * `scripts/qa-fraicheur-fr.mjs`.
   *
   * The ORDER is unchanged and still the argument: the 23 spaces that declare a
   * heatwave arrangement come first because they are the finding, before the
   * canopy bands they are mostly at the bottom of. Rows at zero are dropped,
   * except the heatwave row, which is kept at zero because "none of the parks
   * you can see stays open in a heatwave" is the entry a reader has to be given
   * — and it is dropped entirely only when the park register itself is off,
   * where it would be a claim about something not on the screen.
   *
   * ── What moved OUT of the key and into the note ───────────────────────────
   *
   * `Canopée non mesurée` is one space in 984. A key row spends the same height
   * on it as on the 582 shaded parks, and a reader scanning eight swatches for
   * a colour they can see on the map will never find that grey. It is in the
   * note instead, which prints as TEXT under the block — the register's own
   * silence, reported rather than ranked.
