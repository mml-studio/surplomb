/**
 * Carroyage INSEE — the demand side of a location, drawn as ground you can
 * stand a business on.
 *
 * WHY THIS LAYER EXISTS. Everything the app already draws over France is
 * SUPPLY: where the schools are, where the doctors are, what sold, what the
 * PLU allows. None of it says how many people live within a walk of the plot,
 * or what they earn. A commune average cannot answer that — Lyon 7e is one
 * code covering both the Guillotière and Gerland — so the unit has to be
 * smaller than the administration, and INSEE's 200 m carroyage is the only
 * national grid that is.
 *
 * A CELL IS A PLACE TO PUT A SYMBOL, NOT A TILE TO PAINT, AND THAT IS THE FIRST
 * RULE. The carroyage is 2.3 million contiguous squares; drawing each one edge
 * to edge turns a populated département into an opaque quilt with the map
 * underneath it — no streets, no place names, no marker from any other layer,
 * nothing to locate the statistic against. A layer that hides the map is not a
 * layer, it is a replacement. So each cell carries one flat translucent DISC at
 * its centre, capped at `FILOSOFI_MAX_FILL` of the cell, and both the gap
 * around it and the alpha through it are the map. See `cellSymbol` in
 * `filosofiFeed.js` for the ceiling and its price.
 *
 * FLAT, AND THAT WAS A CORRECTION. The count was the EXTRUSION first, which
 * failed three ways: a camera looking down reads no height at all, paying for
 * the tower with the cell's whole footprint cost the basemap, and a field of
 * prisms stands in front of the streets it is describing. Nothing here stands
 * up. The discs are laid a few metres clear of the terrain, which is all the
 * third dimension a statistic about people needs.
 *
 * TWO CHANNELS, AND THE SIZE IS NOT THE INDICATOR. Colour carries the chosen
 * indicator; AREA carries the COUNT that indicator was computed on. That is the
 * whole design and it is a correctness decision, not a style one: "27 100 € per
 * person" has no extent, and the eye reads extent as quantity, so a symbol
 * sized by an average is a picture of nothing.
 *
 * SIX SIZE CLASSES, on national quantiles of the count — the same shape as the
 * six-band colour ramp, and the same argument: the eye cannot read a continuous
 * magnitude back into a number, and the card carries the number anyway. A
 * strictly proportional scale was tried first and it cannot survive the range —
 * see `FILOSOFI_SIZE_BREAKS`, where the arithmetic is written down against a
 * measured viewport.
 *
 * THE HOLLOW DISCS ARE IMPUTED. INSEE publishes a flag meaning "this cell's
 * figures were modelled, because publishing the observation would have broken
 * confidentiality". In the 80 105-cell national sample the ramps were measured
 * on, 39 % of cells carry it. Drawing those identically to observed cells would
 * be drawing a model and calling it a census, so an imputed cell is drawn as a
 * RING — the map shows through where the data was inferred — and the legend
 * says so. The ring is grown to keep the area it loses to its hole, because the
 * hollow is a claim about PROVENANCE and must not double as a quieter claim
 * about the count.
 *
 * THE BREAKS ARE NATIONAL AND ABSOLUTE. A viewport-relative ramp would make
 * Neuilly and Roubaix the same picture, which is the opposite of the point.
 * `filosofiFeed.js` carries the measurement: population-weighted quantiles over
 * a 42-box national sample, so a colour means the same thing wherever the
 * camera is.
 *
 * ABOVE THE GRID'S CEILING THE LAYER CHANGES DATASET RATHER THAN GOING BLANK.
 * The carroyage refuses a box wider than 0.9°, and that refusal is right — 2.3
 * million squares sampled down to a page is a picture of the sample. It also
 * left the map empty at the altitude the app opens at. So past that ceiling the
 * layer draws INSEE's own aggregates instead: one disc per département, then
 * per région, from a second keyless API. It is a DIFFERENT DATASET — a median
 * where the grid has a mean, people where it has households, 2023 where the
 * relayed grid is 2019 — and `filosofiTerritoires.js` puts that on every card,
 * because a reader who thinks they are seeing the same numbers from further
 * away is being misled by the zoom.
