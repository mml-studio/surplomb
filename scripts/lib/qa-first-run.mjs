/**
 * The first-run experience, taken out of QA's way — once, for every harness,
 * instead of once per harness.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. `#first-run-launcher` is a card over the globe (and
 * `#first-run-hint`, variant C's bubble, sits on the search field) that shows
 * ONCE PER BROWSER by design — see the SHOW POLICY at the top of
 * `src/firstRunExperience.js`. It no longer comes back every session, but a
 * headless harness is always a brand-new browser with empty storage, so every
 * one of them still boots straight into it, and it does three things to a QA
 * run, none of them obvious from the failure:
 *
 *   - it swallows clicks. `document.elementFromPoint` at a feature's own
 *     screen coordinate returns `ASIDE#first-run-launcher`, not the globe, so
 *     a hit-test assertion fails while the feature is drawn perfectly. The
 *     bubble eats no click, but the first pointerdown closes it and writes
 *     the app's keys in the middle of the run.
 *   - it paints over the pixels a legibility or contact-sheet check counts.
 *   - it holds focus, so keyboard assertions read the card's field or tiles.
 *
 * Every new dataset harness used to rediscover this the hard way and then
 * re-invent a dismissal, differently: the durable key in one, the session key
 * in another, ESC-after-boot in a third. That is the repeated work this file
 * ends. Writing a new harness is now one call — `newQaPage(browser)` instead
 * of `browser.newPage()` — and `src/qaFirstRunSuppression.test.mjs` fails
 * `npm test` for any `scripts/qa-*.mjs` that drives the app without it, so a
 * harness cannot forget rather than merely should not.
 *
 * HOW IT SUPPRESSES, AND WHY THAT WAY. It writes the app's own PER-SESSION
 * dismissal key before any page script runs, which is one of the two keys the
 * app itself records when a visitor closes the card. All three variants (A, B
 * and C) pass through the same show decision, so this one seed hides the card
 * AND the bubble. The alternatives were each rejected for a reason worth
 * keeping written down:
 *
 *   - `?welcome=0` works, but it edits a URL that harnesses assert on and
 *     rebuild (share links, `?map=`, deep links), and it is lost the moment
 *     one navigates somewhere the harness composed itself.
 *   - the DURABLE key (`gev:first-run-mission:v1`) is stored state no visitor
 *     produced: the app writes it only when someone closes the card. A harness
 *     that reads storage back — or one checking that the app writes nothing
 *     it was not given — would be reading QA's own writes. Available behind
 *     `{ durable: true }` for the rare harness that needs suppression to
 *     survive a `sessionStorage.clear()`.
 *   - pressing ESC after boot is too late: by then the card has painted, has
 *     been screenshotted, and has already eaten a click.
 *
 * `evaluateOnNewDocument` re-runs on every navigation and reload of the page,
 * so this survives the mid-run reloads harnesses do — and it runs BEFORE the
 * app's own boot code, which is the whole point. It deliberately touches
 * `sessionStorage` only, so it also survives the `localStorage.clear()` that
 * a couple of harnesses install at document start for their own reasons.

 * session**, whether or not the run ever looks at the ground. `scripts/` holds
 * 113 harnesses that boot the app, run from a dozen workspaces against ONE
 * shared token, and on 2026-09-15 they carried the free tier to 1 001 of its
 * 1 000 monthly sessions by the fifteenth. The same invoice showed 15 Bing
 * imagery sessions, because Bing only loads when something clicks its chip —
 * that gap is the whole diagnosis.
 *
 * WHY A WINDOW FLAG AND NOT `?photoreal=0`: the app reads both, but a harness
 * cannot rely on the URL. Harnesses assert on, rebuild and compose URLs mid-run
 * (share links, `?map=`, deep links), so a query param falls off exactly when a
 * run navigates — and that would not merely lose the saving, it would flip the
 * surface regime underneath a height assertion halfway through a run. This is
 * the same reasoning that keeps the first-run card off `?welcome=0`.
 *
 * WHAT IT CHANGES ON SCREEN: the app boots onto OSM instead of the photoreal
 * globe, and the `photoreal` chip reads "off for this session". A harness that
 * measures anything against Google's 3D surface — ground clamping, seating,
 * mesh floors, the map-source tray itself — must therefore opt back in with
 * `newQaPage(browser, { photoreal: true })` and pay the root tile on purpose.

 * Default polling interval, in ms, for `page.waitForFunction`.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS HERE AND NOT LEFT TO PUPPETEER. Puppeteer's default is
 * `polling: 'raf'` — it re-evaluates the predicate inside a
 * `requestAnimationFrame` loop. That is the wrong clock for this application
 * twice over:
 *
 *   - **This app parks itself on purpose.** The render governor stops asking
 *     for frames when nothing moves; that IS the feature `qa-perf.mjs`
 *     measures. A wait clocked on animation frames in an app engineered to
 *     stop producing them is a wait that can outlive its own timeout.
 *   - **Headless Chrome may never tick rAF at all.** Measured on this Mac,
 *     2026-09-09, on a bare `data:text/html` page with no app in sight: a
 *     predicate already true resolves in 3 ms, a predicate that becomes true
 *     after 1 s never resolves and the wait dies at its full timeout. The same
 *     predicate with `polling: 100` resolves in 1 002 ms.
 *
 * The symptom is indistinguishable from a broken app: every harness that waits
 * for `window.__godsEyeView.viewer` hangs for 90 s and reports a globe that
 * never booted, while `page.evaluate` answers that the viewer is right there.
 * Several of the fleet's "pre-existing failures" are this and nothing else.
 *
 * 50 ms rather than rAF's ~16: slower to notice a transition by at most a
 * frame or two, which is noise next to the multi-second settles these
 * harnesses take afterwards, and it cannot stop ticking. A harness that
 * genuinely wants frame-clocked polling passes its own `polling` and this
 * steps aside.
