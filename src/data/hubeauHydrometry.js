/**
 * Hub'Eau Hydrométrie — France's live river-gauge mesh.
 *
 * Eaufrance publishes every hydrometric station in France and its real-time
 * observations through a keyless REST API (api_version 2.0.1). This is the raw
 * measurement layer underneath Vigicrues (see `vigicrues.js`): Vigicrues gives
 * the state's colour-coded reading of flood risk, Hub'Eau gives the numbers
 * that reading is made from. Upstream chain: measurements from the DREALs and
 * other operators → the PHyC platform run by the Service Central Vigicrues
 * (SCV, ex-SCHAPI) → Hub'Eau, edited by the OFB and hosted by the BRGM.
 *
 * MEASURED against the live API on 2026-08-26:
 *   - `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` — fetched straight from the browser, no
 *     proxy, exactly like the USGS and Vigicrues feeds
 *   - 6,469 stations in the reference set, 4,150 flagged `en_service`
 *   - a France-wide bbox reference request returned 3,919 active stations
 *
 * ── The two unit traps ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Verified against Le Rhône à Tarascon (V720001002), which returned
 * `Q: 717000`, and a Seine station returning `H: 978`:
 *   - **Q (débit) is in LITRES per second.** 717,000 L/s = 717 m³/s, right for
 *     the lower Rhône in late August. Read as m³/s it would be 3.4 Amazons.
 *   - **H (hauteur) is in MILLIMETRES**, and — the bigger trap — it is a
 *     staff-gauge reading against each station's OWN arbitrary zero. All 2,463
 *     stations reporting H carry `code_systeme_alti_serie = 31`, SANDRE's
 *     "système local, hauteur relative". 15% of live H values are negative,
 *     and the semantics are not even consistent between producers: one dam
 *     reports 937,000 mm (a reservoir surface as an absolute NGF altitude)
 *     while another reports −17,180 mm (drawdown below its local zero).
 *     H therefore CANNOT drive a colour ramp or a size ramp, and two stations'
 *     H values are not comparable. Only Q scales anything here, and H is only
 *     ever shown as that one station's own number, labelled as a gauge reading.
 *
 * ── Why only reporting stations are drawn ───────────────────────────────────
 * `en_service=true` is not the same as reporting: of 4,150 nominally active
 * stations, roughly 2,429 (H) and 1,786 (Q) actually delivered a reading in the
 * last hour. Drawing the reference set would put ~1,700 permanently dark dots
 * on the map that read as a rendering bug. So the layer draws stations that
 * have a reading in the window, and reports the silent ones as a number in
 * `getStats()` instead of as dead pixels.
 *
 * ── Why the window is an hour ───────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Readings do not arrive smoothly. A national census by lookback window:
 * 15 min → 261 stations, 30 min → 891, 60 min → 2,429, and the census
 * saturates around 2,500–2,700. Per-station age of the latest reading inside a
 * 60-minute window: p10 12 min, median 27 min, p90 42 min. An hour is the
 * narrowest window that sees most of the network.
 *
 * At a France-wide camera that hour exceeds the 20,000-row page cap: a live
 * run on 2026-08-26 drew 2,070 stations and reported `truncated: true`. That
 * is ~77% of the reporting network at national zoom and all of it at regional
 * zoom, and `getStats().truncated` says which — a truncated page is never
 * presented as the whole network.
 *
 * This is not a flood-warning tool. The values are raw, unvalidated
 * ("Brute" / "Non qualifiée"), 23% of live Q readings are flagged *Douteuse*
 * by the producer, and Hub'Eau publishes the API "sans garantie sur leur
 * disponibilité et leur performance". Vigicrues is the official channel.

 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * "717 m³/s" is not information. It is a quantity with nothing to compare it
 * to, and a visitor cannot tell a drought from a flood from a perfectly
 * ordinary Tuesday. The card has carried that gap since it was written, and
 * the comment below in `buildHubeauCard` argued its way out of closing it:
 * a historical percentile "would compare an INSTANTANEOUS reading against a
 * distribution of DAILY MEANS across all seasons, so a September low would
 * read as an extreme partly because September is always low."
 *
 * That objection is right about the WRONG comparison. The fix is not to drop
 * the context, it is to make the comparison SEASONAL: this September against
 * the other Septembers, never against the year.
 *
 * MEASURED on 2026-09-14 against `obs_elab`:
 *   - `grandeur_hydro_elab=QmM` — monthly mean discharge, validated and
 *     expertised, in litres per second like everything else here
 *   - 39 of 39 sampled reporting stations have a monthly series. The "half the
 *     network has no recent daily series" objection is TRUE and applies to
 *     `QmnJ`, the daily grandeur — it does not apply to the monthly one
 *   - series depth ranges from 6 months to 895 (1944 → 2026)
 *   - 51.6 KB in 0.43 s with a `fields` list, against 339 KB without
 *   - Adding `date_debut_obs_elab` to trim the series server-side made it
 *     SLOWER, not faster: 22 KB in 2.54 s. The window is applied here instead.
 *
 * What it produced for Le Rhône à Tarascon that morning, at 340 m³/s: the mean
 * of its last 26 Septembers is 933 m³/s and the lowest September on record is
 * 538. The raw number said nothing. The comparison says the lower Rhône is at
 * a third of its normal September flow, below anything measured in 26 years.
 *
 * TWO HONESTIES THIS KEEPS. The reading is instantaneous and the reference is
 * a set of monthly means, so the card says "moyenne" and never "percentile" —
 * a ratio against a mean is exactly what it claims to be. And stage is NEVER
 * given this treatment: a QmM series is a discharge, and a staff reading
 * against a local zero has no business being compared to it.

 * The one or two card lines that turn a discharge into a reading.
 *
 * ── The period names a SPAN, not a count ────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * "en moyenne sur les 29 dernières années" is what the line says, where 29 is
 * the period the values were drawn from — not how many of them there are. An
 * earlier draft wrote "sur 26 des 29 dernières années" to expose the holes a
 * hydrometric series always has; it is accurate and it is one number too many
 * for a card someone reads in two seconds. The mean is over whatever the last
 * 29 years published, which is exactly what the sentence claims.
 *
 * A station whose series stopped years ago gets the period named instead:
 * nothing about 1997-2015 is "dernières".
 *
 * NO VERDICT. A draft also appended "sous le plus bas septembre mesuré" when
 * the reading fell under the record low. The range is printed right above it,
 * so the reader who wants that conclusion already has both numbers, and a card
 * that draws the conclusion for them is one step from sounding like an alert —
 * which this layer is not (Vigicrues is).
 *
 * ── The ratio is DRAWN, and that is the card's only bar ──────────────────────
 *
 * "48 % de cette moyenne" now carries a gauge: 48 % of the cells inked, the
 * other 52 % left as `░`. It is the one comparison on this card with a
 * reference worth drawing against — the river's own September, over a quarter
 * century — and the picture answers "how far off normal" before the number is
 * read.
 *
 * It also costs nothing: the mean is already fetched, and the glyphs are
 * assembled from two characters.
 *
 * What it REPLACED, on every card that can draw it, is the 24 h hydrograph.
 * That sparkline is zero-based, so an ordinary river — five days out of six,
 * for most of the network — renders as 48 full bars, which is a picture of a
 * progress bar at 100 %, sitting one line above "48 % of the monthly mean".
 * Two bars saying opposite things is worse than one bar saying something. The
 * hydrograph's amplitude line ("de 5,1 à 5,5 m³/s sur 24 h") survives, because
 * that is where the 24 h information actually was; a stage station, or a
 * discharge with no usable monthly series, still gets the sparkline, because
 * there it is the only bar available. See `buildHubeauCard`.

/**
 * The card for one station.
 *
 * Tiered on purpose. Everything above the 24 h block comes from data the layer
 * already had on the wire and is therefore always present; both the 24 h
 * series and the monthly mean are one extra request each, and the card renders
 * completely without either.
 *
 * ONE BAR PER CARD. Two are available — the seasonal gauge (today against this
 * month's multi-year mean) and the 24 h hydrograph — and only one is drawn.
 * The gauge wins wherever it can be built, because its scale means something:
 * the sparkline is zero-based, so a river doing nothing renders as a solid
 * block of full bars, and a solid block sitting above "48 %" reads as a
 * progress bar contradicting the number under it. The 24 h amplitude line
 * survives in both cases and takes over the `↻` when the sparkline stands
 * down. See the header of `hubeauSeasonalLines`.
 *
 * WHAT THIS CARD DELIBERATELY DOES NOT SAY:
 *
 * • **An absolute water altitude.** `altitude_ref_alti_station` is published
 *   for 81.6 % of stage stations and its documented purpose is exactly this
 *   conversion, but checked against the site's own altitude over 1 756
 *   stations the two disagree by a median 1.1 m, a p90 of 30.8 m and a max of
 *   20 km, across at least six altimetric systems. The gauge zero is shown as
 *   what it is — the datum the stage is counted from — and the addition is
 *   left to a reader who knows which system their station uses.
 *
 * • **A historical percentile.** Still refused, and for the reason it always
 *   was: it would rank an INSTANTANEOUS reading inside a distribution of DAILY
 *   MEANS taken across all seasons, so a September low would read as an
 *   extreme partly because September is always low — and half the network has
 *   no recent daily series, so the line would appear for some stations and not
 *   others and read as a bug.
 *
 *   What replaced it is NOT that comparison. The seasonal lines above compare
 *   this month against the same month in other years, from the validated
 *   monthly series 39 of 39 sampled stations publish, and they say "moyenne"
 *   rather than claiming a rank. See the SEASONAL CONTEXT section.
 *
 * • **Anything resembling a flood warning.** These values are raw and
 *   unqualified, 23 % of live discharge readings carry the producer's own
 *   `Douteuse` flag, and Vigicrues is the official channel. The module header
 *   has always said so; the card now has room to repeat it where it matters.
 *
 * • **The station's local influence.** `influence_locale_station` is the
 *   producer's note on what perturbs their own rating curve — a weir, a lock,
 *   a tidal reach. On the card it rendered as "⚠ influence locale : Forte",
 *   a warning glyph and a word with no referent, on a station measuring
 *   normally. It is gone from the request as well as the card.
 *
