/**
 * Géoportail de l'urbanisme feed projection — what may legally be built on the
 * plot opposite, and what the state has already encumbered this one with.
 *
 * WHY THIS MATTERS TO A BUYER MORE THAN ALMOST ANYTHING ELSE. A listing shows
 * the flat. It does not show that the car park across the street is zoned for
 * twenty-five metres of construction, or that the address sits inside an
 * airport noise-exposure plan, or that a railway protection strip runs under
 * the balcony. All three are public, all three are drawable, and all three are
 * read by hand today — one PDF at a time — if they are read at all.
 *
 * MEASURED against APIcarto on 2026-09-01, at 2.3760,48.8300 (Paris 13e):
 *   - `GET apicarto.ign.fr/api/gpu/zone-urba?geom={Point}`
 *     → 200, **89,897 bytes**, one feature: zone `UG`, "Zone urbaine générale",
 *       partition `DU_75056`, PLU approved 2026-06-16, 3,588 vertices
 *   - `GET apicarto.ign.fr/api/gpu/assiette-sup-s?geom={Point}`
 *     → 200, **1,396,720 bytes**, five servitudes, **56,063 vertices total**
 *   - the response echoes the request origin in `access-control-allow-origin`
 *
 * WHERE THE 1.4 MB GOES, AND WHY THE PROXY EXISTS. One `pm1` servitude — a
 * technological-risk envelope — carries **50,669 vertices** on its own, and
 * coordinates are published to **8 decimal places**, which is a millimetre.
 * The browser needs an outline it will draw at city zoom. So this projection
 * rounds to 5 dp (~1 m), drops the points that rounding collapses, and
 * decimates what remains, reporting `simplified` per ring rather than pretending
 * the result is the surveyed boundary. Nothing here is a legal document; the
 * `urlreg` of each servitude is relayed so a reader can reach the one that is.
 *
 * THE FIELD THAT IS NOT THERE. There is no `categorie` on a servitude. The
 * type is `suptype` — a short code (`ac1`, `t1`, `pm1`, `t5`…) — beside
 * `typeass`, `nomass` and `nomsuplitt`. The codes are the national SUP
 * nomenclature and are meaningless on screen, so SUP_TYPE_LABELS below turns
 * them into the sentence a buyer needs. Anything unmapped keeps its raw code
 * rather than being hidden.
 *
 * TWO REGIMES, ONE PROJECTION. Close in, the zoning half is asked for over a
 * BOX — the neighbourhood, not only the ground underfoot — because "what may
 * be built on the plot opposite" is the question this layer exists for and a
 * point cannot answer it. Above `GPU_BOX_MAX_ALTITUDE_M` it falls back to the
 * point, which is still a correct answer and a far cheaper one. The servitude
 * half is ALWAYS a point: measured, one 390 m box over Lyon's Presqu'île
 * returns 210 easement features and 2.3 MB, four times the payload for the
 * part of the answer a point already gets right.
 *
 * Side-effect-free, and its only dependency is `ringGeometry.js` — the
 * cadastre layer had already paid for the point-in-polygon this needs to say
 * WHICH of several returned zones is the one under the operator's feet.

 * Project the zoning answer.

 * neighbourhood arrives — 52 zones over Paris at the layer's own ceiling — and
 * exactly one of them normally holds the scan point. `atPoint` marks it, so
 * the marker and the card still answer the point question directly while the
 * map answers the wider one.
 *
 * WHO DECIDES `atPoint` DEPENDS ON WHO WAS ASKED, and getting this wrong is
 * subtle enough to be worth the paragraph. Under a POINT query every feature
 * APIcarto returns intersects that point by construction — the service has
 * already answered the question, and re-deciding it here can only disagree
 * with it. Under a BOX query the service has answered a different question, so
 * this decides, against the ring as PUBLISHED rather than the one that will be
 * drawn.
 *
 * That distinction is not academic. Ustaritz's `UB` outer ring is 521 vertices
 * and is decimated to 400 for drawing; the scan point APIcarto itself answers
 * `UB` for falls OUTSIDE the decimated ring, because a straightened edge cut
 * across it. The drawn shape is a simplification and must never be the thing
 * that decides which rule applies to a house — it is wrong by exactly the
 * tolerance the layer already declares.
 *
 * More than one `atPoint` is not an error and is not deduplicated: two
 * communes digitising their shared limit independently really do zone the same
 * ground twice, and the layer reports it rather than picking a winner.
