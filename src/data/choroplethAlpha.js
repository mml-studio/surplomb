/**
 * The fill-alpha ladder for a French count choropleth.
 *
 * ── Who still imports this, as of 2026-09-03 ────────────────────────────────
 *
 * ONE layer: `amenities-fr`. This module was written for four — `irve-fr`,
 * `sup-fr`, `schools-fr` and `amenities-fr` — and three of them left when they
 * stopped being flat fills. A prism's body carries a CONSTANT alpha
 * (`choroplethPrism.js`, `PRISM_BODY_ALPHA`) precisely so that alpha encodes
 * nothing at all (CARTOGRAPHY A3); a descending ladder there would put a
 * second, contradictory reading on a volume already seen through another
 * volume. The measurements below are still the reason this ladder is shaped
 * the way it is, and they still hold for the layers that do paint a flat fill
 * — `amenities-fr`, and `medecins-fr` / `petite-enfance-fr` / `delinquance-fr`
 * if they ever adopt it. Do not delete it as unused; do not re-add it to a
 * prism layer either.
 *
 * ── The defect this replaces ────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * All four ramps ran dark → light and carried an ASCENDING alpha ladder,
 * `[0.34, 0.40, 0.46, 0.53, 0.60, 0.68]`, each module explaining it as "density
 * reads as weight as well as hue". That reasoning holds over a CONSTANT
 * backdrop. These layers do not have one: they sit on live imagery whose
 * lightness ranges from near-black water to a near-white winter city.
 *
 * Over a light urban basemap the ladder inverted the reading. Composited on
 * `#c8c4bb`, `irve-fr` produced CIE L* values of
 *
 *     67.4 · 65.9 · 65.3 · 65.8 · 69.6 · 78.0
 *
 * — a U, not a ramp: class 1 read LIGHTER than classes 2, 3 and 4. The cause
 * is arithmetic, not palette. The darkest swatch was the most transparent, so
 * on a light background it was the one the ground washed out most, while the
 * lightest swatch was the most opaque and stayed light. `sup-fr` and
 * `amenities-fr` failed the same way (CARTOGRAPHY B3: six declared classes
 * must be six PERCEIVED classes).
 *
 * ── The fix ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The ladder DESCENDS. Alpha is highest where the fill is darkest, because
 * that is the end an unknown background can wash out; the pale end is already
 * lighter than most imagery and needs less help to stay light.
 *
 * Alpha stops being a second encoding of the value and becomes what it has to
 * be: the control that keeps the ramp's OWN lightness ordering intact against
 * a backdrop the layer does not choose. Hue and lightness still carry the
 * datum, monotonically, which is the whole point of an ordered ramp.
 *
 * ── How these numbers were chosen ───────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Searched against all four palettes over eight backgrounds — light urban,
 * water, forest, mid ortho, near-white, near-black, pale blue, pale sand — for
 * the ladder maximising the SMALLEST L* gap between adjacent classes, capped at
 * 0.80 so the imagery still reads through. Result: every class is at least
 * 5.7 L* apart from its neighbours on every background tested, against a
 * previous worst case of −0.6 (an inversion). `choroplethAlpha.test.mjs`
 * recomputes the whole compositing chain and fails if any pair inverts, so a
 * future palette edit cannot silently reintroduce the U.
