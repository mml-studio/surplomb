/**
 * The keyless-ears voice session: browser STT -> text brain -> browser TTS.
 *
 * This is the second way to drive the same 28 tools. Where gevRealtime.js opens
 * one speech-to-speech WebRTC session to OpenAI, this one splits the job three
 * ways and only the middle piece costs anything:
 *
 *   ears   Web Speech API (SpeechRecognition) — no key, no download
 *   brain  /api/voice/brain -> OpenRouter (Mistral by default) — ONE key
 *   mouth  speechSynthesis — no key, OS voices, works offline
 *   hands  createGevActionRunner — the SAME runner the realtime path uses
 *
 * The trade is honest and worth stating where someone will read it: this is
 * turn-based, not full duplex. You cannot interrupt it mid-sentence the way you
 * can interrupt the realtime model, and the round trip adds latency the
 * speech-to-speech path does not have. What it buys is a voice cockpit that
 * runs on an OpenRouter key instead of an OpenAI one — and a mic that keeps
 * working when the brain is a model somebody else self-hosts.
