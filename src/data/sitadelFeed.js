/**
 * @module sitadelFeed
 *
 * Sitadel — every building permit France has granted since 2013, and the
 * arithmetic that decides which of them is allowed to have a position.
 *
 * The Cesium drawing lives in `sitadelFrance.js`. Everything here is pure and
 * node-testable, and it is where the one hard problem of this layer is held
 * down: **the file has no coordinates at all.**
 *
 * ── What this layer is, against the one it sits next to ─────────────────────
 *
 * `dvf-sales` draws completed transactions — what changed hands, for how much,
 * with a latitude and a longitude already in the file. This draws
 * AUTHORISATIONS. It is the only forward-looking dataset on this globe:
 * everything else describes what exists, and Sitadel describes what somebody
 * has been given permission to build and has not necessarily built. On the same
 * parcel the two compose — "this plot sold in 2023, and a permit for 40
 * dwellings was granted on it in 2025" — which is exactly why the position has
 * to be the PARCEL and not the commune.
 *
 * ── The decisive fact: 94 columns and not one of them is a coordinate ───────
 *
 * Measured 2026-09-01 against the live DiDo metadata for datafile
 * `8b35affb-55fc-4c1f-915b-7750f974446a`: 1 917 260 rows, 94 columns,
 * `geoFields: ["REG","DEP"]` — the portal itself claims no finer geography than
 * the département. The demolition file `1a9a2f0c-…` says the same over its
 * 202 895 rows and 33 columns. Across all four Sitadel files there are
 * 3 020 749 permits and zero positions.
 *
 * What the file DOES carry is up to three cadastral parcel references per
 * permit — and this repo already draws cadastral parcels. So every point on
 * this layer is something we COMPUTED, and the whole design is about being
 * able to say, per permit, whether that computation is allowed to produce a
 * position at all.
 *
 * ── The placement rule, and the four answers it gives ───────────────────────
 *
 * A permit is placed on a parcel only when one of its references resolves to
 * EXACTLY ONE parcel in its commune. There are four outcomes; all four are
 * counted, only the first is drawn, and the other three are on the row:
 *
 *   placed      — one parcel. Drawn.
 *   ambiguous   — the reference matches SEVERAL parcels of the same commune.
 *                 Never placed. See "the préfixe trap" below.
 *   missing     — the reference matches nothing: the parcel was divided or
 *                 renumbered after the permit was filed.
 *   noref       — the file publishes no cadastral reference at all.
 *
 * Measured over 22 474 permits in eleven communes on 2026-09-01, against the
 * Etalab cadastre edition 2026-06-01: **11 902 placed (53.0%)**, 7 065
 * ambiguous (31.4%), 3 338 missing (14.9%), 169 with no reference (0.8%).
 *
 * That 53.0% is the honest number and it is worth one comparison. DREAL
 * Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes published the same join officially: 362 038 permits,
 * 162 171 with a geometry — 44.8%, and only their `precision: "parcelle"` rows
 * ever carry a point.
 *
 * ── The préfixe trap, which is the one nobody had measured ──────────────────
 *
 * Sitadel publishes `SEC_CADASTRE1` (2 characters) and `NUM_CADASTRE1`. The
 * cadastre's key has a THIRD component — the `préfixe`, three digits — and
 * Sitadel has no column for it. In most of France that is harmless because the
 * préfixe is `000` everywhere in the commune. Where a commune absorbed others,
 * it is not.
 *
 * Toulouse publishes 46 préfixes (801–846) and **70 815 of its 91 938 parcels
 * share their (section, numéro) with at least one other parcel of the same
 * commune**. A join that ignores the préfixe "places" 97.7% of Toulouse's
 * permits and nearly all of them on the wrong parcel. Resolved honestly, only
 * **9.5% of Toulouse's 3 846 permits land on a single parcel** and 88.2% are
 * ambiguous. All sixteen Marseille arrondissements have the same defect.
 *
 * How common: over the 1 923 communes of seven départements (13, 14, 31, 44,
 * 49, 69, 75), **129 — 6.7% — publish a section code under more than one
 * préfixe**, so a Sitadel reference there is ambiguous by construction. It is
 * 23.3% in Maine-et-Loire, which is full of communes nouvelles, and 0.0% in
 * Paris.
 *
 * ── The arrondissement, solved from the file itself ─────────────────────────
 *
 * `COMM` is 75056 on all 3 595 Paris permits, while the cadastre is keyed by
 * arrondissement (75101–75120). The recon proposed deriving the arrondissement
 * from the postal code. There is something better, and the publisher's own
 * variable dictionary says so: NUM_DAU is "un numéro sur 13 caractères : les 6
 * premiers caractères correspondent au code commune". Measured: **all 3 595
 * Paris permits carry 075101–075120 in those six characters**, and all 1 773
 * Lyon permits carry 069381–069389 — 100% filled against 98.4% for the address.
 * Paris then joins at **93.0%** and Lyon at **81.3%**.
 *
 * Marseille is the exception that proves it: all 4 842 of its permits carry
 * `013055`, the aggregate commune, so the registration number says nothing.
 * The postal code is the only fallback there (99.7% filled) and it lands at
 * 20.6% placed — because Marseille also has the préfixe defect.
 *
 * ── The join is CHECKED, not assumed ────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `SUPERFICIE_TERRAIN` is the surface the applicant declared for the plot, and
 * it is filled on 95.4% of rows. It is not used to place anything; it is used
 * to audit the placement. Over 5 929 placed permits in Nantes, Paris and
 * Bordeaux the median ratio of the drawn parcel's area to the declared terrain
 * is **1.00**, and **96.0% agree within a factor of two** (Paris: p10 1.00,
 * p90 1.00). That is independent evidence that the parcel we drew is the parcel
 * the permit was granted for, and every card carries its own copy of it.
 *
 * ── The age curve, and why it is a fact about building and not about data ───
 *
 * Over the eight sampled communes with no préfixe defect (13 538 permits,
 * 77.0% placed), the placement rate by year of authorisation runs 2013 66.4%,
 * 2015 72.6%, 2018 73.0%, 2021 79.6%, 2023 86.2%, 2025 89.6%, **2026 95.4%**.
 * Dividing a plot is what happens when somebody builds on it, so the dataset
 * systematically loses the permits that changed the ground the most.
 *
 * Dependency-free and side-effect-free (no Cesium, no DOM) so it runs
 * identically in the browser, in the Vite dev-server proxy, and under
 * `node --test`.

/**
 * The colour ladder: three states of a project, plus cancelled, plus

 *
 * The first four are `ETAT_DAU`, and the labels are the publisher's own, taken
 * verbatim from the variable dictionary shipped beside the file
 * (`dictionnaire_variables logements_permis_construire.xls`): `2 = Autorisé`,
 * `4 = Annulé`, `5 = Commencé`, `6 = Terminé`. The same sheet carries the
 * sentence that stops `2` from being read as "authorised and not started":
 * *"Toutes les DAU du fichier ont été autorisées ; les modalités 4 à 6
 * concernent des DAU pour lesquelles est connu l'état postérieur d'avancement
 * du projet."* A `2` is a permit about which nothing further has been
 * reported, which is a weaker statement than "nothing has happened".
 *
 * The field is exactly consistent with the three dates, checked over 22 474
 * rows: all 5 241 `Commencé` rows carry a DATE_REELLE_DOC and none a DAACT;
 * all 7 969 `Terminé` rows carry a DAACT; no `Autorisé` row carries either.
 * 103 of the `Terminé` rows carry no start date, which the card names rather
 * than silently completing.
 *
 * The fifth band is not a state, it is a FILE — the permis de démolir. It gets
 * a band of its own instead of being coloured by its own `ETAT_PD` because
 * that field is empty of information there: 1 497 of Nantes' 1 587 demolition
 * permits (94.3%) and 1 582 of Paris' 1 609 (98.3%) sit at `Autorisé`. Four
 * colours spent on a distinction the file does not make would be four colours
 * wasted; one colour spent on "this is authorised to come down" is the whole
 * point of reading that file.
 *
 * The hues avoid the two layers this one is stacked on. `cadastre-fr` runs
 * cyan → green → yellow → orange and `dvf-sales` runs orange → yellow → green
 * → teal; neither uses violet, indigo or deep red. The single overlap is the
 * amber of an open site, which is the most legible reading of "work in
 * progress" and is worth the collision.
