/*
 * A MANIFEST AS A LAYER.
 *
 * `createDatasetLayer(manifest)` returns a module the manager registers like
 * any other. Underneath is the local GeoJSON loader — the same stems, cards,
 * label arbitration and horizon culling the bundled packs get — fed by the
 * source adapters instead of a bundled file. This module owns only what the
 * loader cannot know about a plugged dataset:
 *
 *   · WHEN to fetch. A viewport-scoped source is asked for the view the
 *     camera settled on, padded so a nudge does not refetch, and refetched
 *     when the view leaves that box — or when the last answer was clipped
 *     and the reader has since come closer (a clipped answer over a wide
 *     view says nothing about a narrow one).
 *   · WHEN NOT to. Above `maxSpanDeg` a viewport source is not asked at all:
 *     the row says "rapprochez-vous" as a prompt, not a fault (F6, and the
 *     manager's guidance carve-out). Nothing is drawn from orbit that would
 *     be a sample of a sample.
 *   · WHAT THE ROW SAYS. `n affichés / N connus` with the criterion, every
 *     time an answer was clipped (A5); the publisher and licence as the
 *     source line; a legend per group, or one swatch when the dataset is
 *     flat (D1 — a colour with no printed meaning is a promise).
 *   · WHAT A CARD SAYS. The manifest's `feature.details`, or — when it
 *     declares none — the first few short fields of the row, minus the
 *     columns that only locate or identify it. A line whose value is one of
 *     `feature.blank`, or the one spelling a detail declares `omitWhen` for,
 *     is not written at all: a card is worth its shortest true version.
 *   · WHETHER IT SAYS IT AT ALL. Above `DATASET_DENSE_FEATURE_COUNT` loaded
 *     features a card each is arithmetically impossible, so the overlay
 *     carries the title alone and the detail waits for the click. Derived from
 *     the load, not from the subject — `feature.ambient` overrules it.
