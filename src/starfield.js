/**
 * The star field, moved off the boot path and onto the basemaps it belongs to.
 *
 * ── WHY IT IS NOT THE VIEWER'S DEFAULT ANY MORE ─────────────────────────────
 *
 * Cesium builds a `SkyBox` for every Viewer and fills it with the Tycho-2
 * catalogue: six 1024×1024 JPEGs, **848 kB**, fetched on every cold start
 * before anyone has looked at anything. Measured on the machine this project
 * is actually for (2 cores, 10 Mbit/s, cache empty), removing it moved the
 * boot from **5.3 s to 3.6 s** and the app's own payload from 3.51 MB to
 * 2.67 MB. The stars cost 1.7 seconds of waiting, which is not what they are
 * worth on a page whose first job is to show a map.
 *
 * ── WHY THEY COME BACK, AND EXACTLY WHERE ───────────────────────────────────
 *
 * They were never decoration in general — they are decoration for ONE reading
 * of the globe. On a drawn map (`Plan Google`, `Relief Google`, `OSM`,
 * `Plan IGN`) the Earth is a diagram, and a diagram does not sit in space; the
 * black is a background, not a sky. On a photographic basemap — `Satellite`,
 * `Bing Aerial`, Google's photoreal 3D — the Earth is a photograph taken from
 * orbit, and the sky around it is part of the same claim. So the star field
 * follows the imagery, which is also the only rule short enough to be obvious
 * from the interface without being explained.
 *
 * ── WHY IT IS NEVER LOADED DURING BOOT, EVEN ON A SATELLITE STACK ───────────
 *
 * `sync()` is called at startup too, and a visitor whose build opens on a
 * photographic basemap would otherwise pay exactly the 848 kB this change
 * exists to remove. The first install is therefore deferred to browser idle:
 * the download starts once the boot burst has drained, so it competes with
 * nothing. Later switches — somebody choosing a basemap — install straight
 * away, because by then the boot is long over and a visible delay between the
 * click and the sky would just read as a bug.
 *
 * Cesium's own laziness does the rest: `SkyBox` requests its textures on its
 * first `update()`, so constructing one and showing it IS the trigger, and a
 * hidden one costs nothing. Once built it is kept — switching back and forth
 * between two basemaps must not re-download the sky.
 */

/**
 * Basemaps that show the Earth as photographed rather than drawn.
 *
 * Ids, not `kind`s: `kind` groups by PROVIDER (`ion` holds both Bing Aerial
 * and Bing Labels, `ign-wmts` holds both the orthophoto and the Plan), and
 * provider is not what decides whether the picture is a photograph.
