/**
 * Autorisations d'urbanisme — what is about to be built on this block.
 *
 * The other French registers here describe what stands: the cadastre draws the
 * ground, BD TOPO the roofs, DPE their energy, DVF what they last sold for.
 * This one draws what does NOT stand yet — the permits granted, the cranes
 * open, and, in the three métropoles that publish it, the files still being
 * instructed at the counter this week.
 *
 * WHY COLOUR IS THE STATE AND NOT THE SIZE OF THE PROJECT. A permit's size is
 * already legible from the card, and most dossiers on any given block are a
 * new window or a fence. What a reader cannot get anywhere else is WHERE IN
 * THE PIPELINE each one sits — an application under instruction is a thing
 * that can still be objected to, an open chantier is a thing already making
 * noise, and a completed one is history. Those are different facts about the
 * same street and they get the colour channel.
 *
 * THE COLOURS ARE THE ROW'S, NOT THIS LAYER'S (2026-09-23). « Urbanisme »
 * draws its permits with this layer AND `sitadel-fr`, and the two used to wear
 * two palettes that contradicted each other on the same street. Both now take
 * the class and its colour from `permitProjects.js` — the approved mock's
 * palette, which is Sitadel's — and a dossier is a BADGE there, one size for
 * all, rather than a crane sized by its state.
 *
 * WHY SOME DOTS ARE PALE. `instruction` only ever comes from a métropole
 * portal — the national register contains granted permits only, by
 * construction (`adsFeed.js` quotes the SDES dictionary saying so). So outside
 * Paris, Bordeaux and Nantes there are no pale dots, and that is a property of
 * French open data rather than of the block being looked at. The layer says so
 * in its summary rather than letting the absence read as calm.
 *
 * ── The volumes, and the sentence a permit is allowed to say about them ─────
 *
 * `buildingTheme.js` lets one layer at a time repaint the BD TOPO volumes.
 * This one registers at `precedence` 30 and hands over the same colour it has
 * always used — the state of the dossier — so the ramp on the roofs and the
 * ramp on the cranes are the same ramp. Nothing about the colour choice moves.
 *
 * WHAT MOVES IS THE CLAIM, and it is not the same claim as the marker's. A
 * marker says "a dossier exists at this coordinate". Painting a VOLUME says
 * "this dossier is about THIS building" — and for a new build on bare ground
 * that sentence is false twice over: the permit is about a thing that does not
 * exist yet, and there is no volume under it to paint. So the theme is offered
 * only the dossiers that can be about something standing:
 *
 * • **declared works on an existing building** — `adsFeed.js` writes the SDES
 *   vocabulary verbatim into `purpose` (`NATURE_PROJET_DECLAREE`: `1 =
 *   nouvelle construction`, `2 = travaux sur construction existante`), so the
 *   distinction is READ, not guessed;
 * • **a permis de démolir** (`PD`), which by definition names something that
 *   stands;
 * • **a dossier whose nature is not published**, painted, and counted apart.
 *
 * Withheld, counted, and left as a crane only: a declared `nouvelle
 * construction`, and a **permis d'aménager** (`PA`), which authorises the
 * development of LAND and never a building.
 *
 * MEASURED, AND THE REASON THE THIRD BUCKET IS PAINTED AT ALL: this layer
 * merges SEVEN sources — the four `SITADEL_FILES` and the three
 * `LOCAL_ADS_PORTALS` — and exactly TWO of them ask for a nature column.
 * `NATURE_PROJET_DECLAREE` is in the `columns` of `logements` and `locaux` and
 * in neither `amenager` nor `demolir` (both of which the FAMILY rule above
 * settles anyway). The three métropole portals ask for none: `normaliseLocalRow`
 * fills `purpose` from the free-text `objet`/`details_du_projet`, and no portal
 * config declares a nature column. Refusing to
 * paint an unpublished nature would therefore switch the theme off entirely in
 * Paris, Bordeaux and Nantes — which are the only three places in France where
 * `instruction` exists at all. The trade taken is the other one: a point that
 * falls INSIDE a surveyed footprint is already evidence that something stands
 * there, the volume is painted, and the count of dossiers painted on that
 * evidence rather than on a declaration is published beside the count painted
 * on a declaration.
 *
 * WHY THE MARKER DOES NOT SHRINK UNDER A THEME. It was the obvious move and it
 * is an A3 violation: marker SIZE is already spoken for — 20 px for a file
 * still open or a chantier running, 17 px granted, 14 px history — and adding
 * "the volume under me is painted" to that channel would put two informations
 * on one variable. The marker is also the click surface and the card, and it
 * has to read the same when Bâti 3D is off. It is left alone.
 *
 * WHY THE UNPAINTED CITY IS NOT AN ADMISSION OF EMPTINESS. This layer scans a
 * DISC of {@link ADS_DEFAULT_RADIUS_M} m (0.50 km²) around the point the camera
 * is looking at. BD TOPO loads a BOX of up to `BDTOPO_MAX_BOX_DEG` = 0.08°,
 * which at 47°N is 8.90 × 6.04 km = 53.8 km² — 107 times the disc. So at most
 * about 1% of the volumes on screen were ever inside the question that was
 * asked, and the other 99% are washed because nobody looked, not because
 * nothing was filed. That is what the theme's "no data" row says, in those
 * words, rather than leaving a grey city to be read as a calm one (A4).
 *
 * WHERE THE `n peints / N connus` LEDGER LIVES. This layer publishes the OFFER
 * side — how many dossiers were handed over, how many were withheld and why,
 * how many carry no usable state — because those are the numbers only it can
 * know. The PAINT side (`themePainted` / `themeUnpainted` / points that landed
 * on no footprint) is published by the Bâti 3D row, which owns the join and
 * runs it against the volumes actually loaded. Running a second join here to
 * repeat those figures would produce two numbers, computed at two instants,
 * for one fact; one number in one place is the honest arrangement.

 *   at 72 it is not. A permit's chantier outlives the window that shows it.
 * - **13 ans** is the whole of Sitadel — `ADS_MAX_MONTHS`, the register's own
 *   2013 start — for reading a plot's entire paperwork history.
 *
 * NOT a free number, and `addressScanLayer.js` says why: everything reachable

 * when Bordeaux was the only source of a shape here — its portal ships the
 * parcel outline beside the dossier, and no other register in this layer
 * published anything but a coordinate. Then the cadastral placement landed
 * (`adsFeed.js`, {@link placeOnParcels}) and gave the WHOLE COUNTRY an outline:
 * a Sitadel row names up to three parcels, and the parcels are drawable. The
 * credit was never moved. A permit in Ustaritz, drawn on a parcel the Etalab
 * cadastre published, was crediting a métropole 200 km away.
 *
 * So the line is derived from the dossiers standing on the plot rather than
 * asserted. Two provenances exist and they are different claims:
 *
 * • `published` — the counter itself shipped the geometry. That is a fact
 *   about the DOSSIER: this is the ground the file was opened on.
 * • `parcelle` / `mere` / `enfant` — the cadastre's parcel, joined on the
 *   reference the dossier names. That is a fact about the GROUND, and the
 *   dossier's own caveat (a division since, a lot deduced) stays on the
 *   marker's card where {@link adsPrecisionLine} already prints it.

/**
 * The layer module.
 *
 * The scan shell is wrapped rather than returned directly, for the one thing it
 * has no hook for: a theme that must be published while the layer is on and
 * withdrawn the moment it is off. `render()` republishes the points on every
 * scan; these three methods own the on/off edge, and they are the reason no
 * other module has to know this layer exists.
 *
 * A DORMANT SCAN NEEDS NO FOURTH HOOK, and the arithmetic says why. The shell
 * stops scanning above 12 000 m and does not call `render()`, so the theme
 * keeps the points of the last block it saw. It cannot paint anything with
 * them: `bdtopo-buildings` refuses a viewport wider than 0.08°, which a 60° FOV
 * camera reaches at 8 900 / (2 · tan 30°) = 7 707 m — a kilometre and a half
 * BELOW the scan ceiling. There is no altitude at which this layer is asleep
 * and there are volumes on screen to mis-paint.
