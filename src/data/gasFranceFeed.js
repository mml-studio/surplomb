/**
 * ODRÉ gas-system feed projection — pure functions, no Cesium, no network.
 *
 * Shared by the `/api/gas-fr` proxy (which runs these server-side, once, and
 * caches the result) and by the unit tests, which run them against captured
 * payloads. Every trap documented here was measured against the live datasets
 * on 2026-08-27 and is pinned by a test on a real captured row — the same
 * arrangement `eco2mixFeed.js` uses for éCO2mix.
 *
 * Four ODRÉ datasets, all keyless, all Licence Ouverte 2.0:
 *
 *   `trace-du-reseau-grt-250`   NaTran (ex-GRTgaz) transmission trace, 11 615 rows
 *   `terega-trace-du-reseau`    Teréga transmission trace, 1 298 rows
 *   `prod-elec-gaz-naturel-fr`  centralised gas-fired power stations, 98 rows
 *   `points-dinjection-de-biomethane-en-france`
 *                               renewable-methane injection points, 854 rows
 *
 * ── The traps, in the order they would bite ─────────────────────────────────
 *
 * 1. **The power-station file publishes every station seven times.** Its 98
 *    rows are 14 sites × 7 annual editions (`annee_de_reference` 2019…2025).
 *    Summing the column gives 50 372 MW for a fleet that is 7 196 MW, and
 *    plotting the rows puts seven stacked dots on each of 14 coordinates. Only
 *    the newest edition of each site survives; the older six are counted and
 *    named as superseded, never drawn.
 *
 * 2. **And the editions disagree with each other.** Landivisiau is `En projet`
 *    in the 2019 and 2020 editions, `En service` from 2021, and publishes its
 *    commissioning date only from the 2022 edition onward. Nothing protects a
 *    reader from landing on the wrong one: the `exports/json` endpoint answers
 *    2025 first, the `records` endpoint answered 2023, 2022, 2025, 2021, 2024,
 *    2019, 2020 for that same station, and neither promises an order. "The
 *    first row per site" is a coin flip that lands two times in seven on a
 *    station that has been running for five years being drawn as a project
 *    that never opened. Newest edition wins, and the card names the edition it
 *    read — and names the status the older ones claimed.
 *
 * 3. **Teréga's third ordinate is not a height.** Teréga publishes
 *    `[lon, lat, z]` where NaTran publishes `[lon, lat]`; that z runs from
 *    −705.5 m to +1 809.4 m over a footprint whose real ground is roughly
 *    0–1 500 m, with 514 vertices below sea level. It is neither a burial
 *    depth nor a ground height, so it is dropped and the stroke is clamped to
 *    the ground. Worse, feeding those 3-tuples to a flat lon/lat reader
 *    silently mis-plots the whole network, so the arity is checked per vertex
 *    rather than per dataset.
 *
 * 4. **One null geometry and eight MultiLineStrings in a file that is
 *    otherwise all LineString.** Teréga row Hautes-Pyrénées publishes
 *    `geo_shape: null`, and 8 rows are MultiLineString carrying 38 parts;
 *    NaTran is 11 615 plain LineStrings. Assuming the NaTran shape throws on
 *    one row and silently drops eight.
 *
 * 5. **Fifteen decimals on a ±250 m product.** Both traces publish
 *    coordinates to ~1e-15° — sub-nanometre — under titles that say they are
 *    simplified to about 250 m. They are rounded to 5 decimals (~1.1 m, still
 *    200× finer than the product's own stated accuracy), which costs nothing
 *    and reveals 165 published "lines" — 147 NaTran and 18 Teréga — whose
 *    vertices are all one point.
 *
 * 6. **`site_ouvert` is the string `"False"`.** Three of the 854 injection
 *    sites in a file titled *en service* are closed, each with a closure date
 *    and its capacity zeroed. `Boolean("False")` is `true` in JavaScript, so
 *    the naive read draws three closed plants at zero size.
 *
 * 7. **Most injection points feed a network this layer does not draw.** 743 of
 *    854 inject into the *distribution* network (GRDF and the local ELDs), 111
 *    into the transmission network whose trace is on screen. Both are drawn
 *    and both are counted, but they are distinguished — an injection point on
 *    the distribution network is not connected to the stroke it happens to sit
 *    beside.
 *
 * 8. **The catalogue's own `modified` date is wrong.** ODRÉ reports
 *    `modified: 2019-11-30` for a power-station file that carries a 2025
 *    edition. Licence Ouverte 2.0 obliges publishing the data's update date,
 *    so what travels to the client is the edition year the projection actually
 *    read, never the catalogue's metadata.
 *
 * ── What this module deliberately does NOT do ───────────────────────────────
 *
 * • It never densifies, smooths or re-routes a trace. Both networks are
 *   published simplified on purpose; drawing a "better" pipeline than the
 *   operator published would invent infrastructure siting.
 * • It never merges NaTran strokes with Teréga strokes. They are two
 *   companies' pipes; their bounding boxes overlap (58 NaTran rows sit inside
 *   Teréga's box) but a shared box is not a shared asset.
 * • It never joins an injection point or a power station to a pipe. Nothing in
 *   any of these four files publishes that link.

/**
 * The two transmission-network operators, with the dataset each publishes.
 *
 * GRTgaz renamed itself **NaTran** in 2025; the dataset id still says `grt`
 * and the catalogue title already says NaTran, so the label carries both —
 * anyone who knows this network knows it by the old name.
 *
 * The two hues are violet and orchid on purpose. A pipeline drawn in any blue
 * is invisible on a map: measured against the OSM stack, a steel-blue stroke
 * sat inside 14/255 of the basemap's own river colour and read as a river,
 * while rendering perfectly — the failure mode a screenshot cannot catch and a
 * pixel count can (see `scripts/qa-gas-fr.mjs`). Violet and orchid occur in no
 * basemap, and neither collides with the orange power stations or the green
 * injection points.
 *
 * BOTH WERE THEN RAISED, AND THE HUE CHOICE IS WHY THEY ONLY NEEDED RAISING.
 * The first pair (`#9d7ae6` violet, `#e87ad0` orchid) cleared the river test
 * and still lost to IGN ortho: a mid-chroma pastel over aerial imagery has
 * nothing to be lighter or darker than, because the imagery supplies every
 * value at once. The answer is not another hue — the hue reasoning above still
 * holds, and the violet band is now crowded anyway (submarine cables at
 * `#b388ff`, road obstacles at `#b06bff`) — it is more chroma HERE plus the
 * dark casing the layer now strokes under every pipe. See `gasFrance.js`.
 *
 * The pair below therefore keeps both hues and pushes each one out: violet
 * stays violet, orchid stays orchid, and the operator channel a reader has
 * already learned survives the change.
