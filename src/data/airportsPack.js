/*
 * AIRPORTS PACK — the shared vocabulary of the bundled OurAirports snapshot.
 *
 * Two callers, one file, so they cannot drift:
 *   - scripts/build-ourairports.mjs SELECTS and PROJECTS rows into
 *     src/data/local_data/airports/airports.geojsonl.
 *   - src/data/localGeojson.js READS the shipped properties back to write the
 *     ambient card for the `local-airports` layer.
 *
 * If the selection policy and the card copy lived apart, a field the build
 * stopped emitting would quietly become a blank line on the globe instead of a
 * failing test. Everything here is pure — no Cesium, no fs, no network — so the
 * build script and the browser both import it as-is.
 *
 * WHY THE PACK IS NOT THE WHOLE CATALOG
 * -------------------------------------
 * OurAirports publishes 86,050 rows. Shipped whole that is roughly 25 MB of
 * committed JSON, and 23,196 of those rows are heliports — in France, almost
 * every one of them a hospital landing pad with no ICAO code and no published
 * status. `isPackedAirport()` states the four clauses that survive instead, and
 * each one is a claim the layer can defend on screen.
 *
 * "GRAND AÉROPORT" IS A SIZE CLASS, NOT A LEGAL CATEGORY
 * -----------------------------------------------------
 * `large_airport` / `medium_airport` / `small_airport` are OurAirports' own
 * editorial size buckets, driven mostly by traffic and runway length. They are
 * NOT the French regulatory ladder (aérodrome d'intérêt national / régional /
 * local) and they do not map onto it. The labels below translate the bucket;
 * they do not upgrade it into a legal status.

 * RUNWAY GEOMETRY — the shape an airport has, and the two rows that are refused
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * `runways.csv` publishes BOTH thresholds of a strip — the `le_latitude_deg` /
 * `le_longitude_deg` pair and the `he_` pair — plus its width. That is a real
 * oriented metric object: the one thing an airport IS and a dot is not. The
 * layer draws it, so the pack has to carry it.
 *
 * Measured on the 2026-09-07 retrieval, over the 7 464 rows the policy keeps:
 *
 *     open runway rows                 8 418
 *     … with two distinct thresholds   6 830   81.1 %
 *     … surviving the two refusals     6 698   79.6 %
 *     airports with ≥ 1 kept runway    4 790   64.2 %  (1 478 of them multi-runway)
 *     … in France + territories          279   20.9 %
 *
 * BY TIER — AND THE ASYMMETRY IS THE WHOLE DESIGN CONSTRAINT
 *
 *     Grand aéroport         1 091 / 1 173   93.0 %
 *     Aéroport sans ligne    1 539 / 1 990   77.3 %
 *     Aéroport de ligne      2 071 / 3 175   65.2 %
 *     Aérodrome & aéroclub       89 / 1 126    7.9 %   ← every one of them French
 *
 * The French long tail — the half of this pack that no global source answers,
 * and the reason clause (c) exists — is exactly the half upstream never
 * georeferenced. So the runway can NEVER be the only sign this layer knows:
 * drawn as the sole mark it would erase 92 % of the aéroclubs from a layer
 * whose entire argument is that they are there. What survives for them is the
 * anchor pastille, and it carries a measurement of its own — see
 * {@link AIRPORT_LENGTH_CLASSES}, which is fed by `length_ft` and covers 82 %.
 *
 * ── THE TWO REFUSALS ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * They live here, not in the build script, because they are claims about what
 * a mark may assert — and this is the module that owns those. Both are cheap
 * consistency tests between two independently published numbers:
 *
 *   1. LENGTH DISAGREEMENT. The distance between the two thresholds and the
 *      published `length_ft` are separate fields, and they should agree. On
 *      6 826 rows the median disagreement is 0.36 % — but 467 rows are more
 *      than 10 % apart and 20 are more than 50 %. Beyond
 *      {@link RUNWAY_GEOM_LENGTH_TOLERANCE} one of the two is simply wrong,
 *      and a runway drawn from a wrong threshold is a runway drawn in the
 *      wrong place. 128 rows refused.
 *   2. ANCHOR OFFSET. A runway belongs to the field it is joined to. Measured
 *      offsets from the airport's own point: median 130 m, p95 1 184 m,
 *      p99 2 170 m — and a maximum of 36 008 m, which is a bad join, not a
 *      long taxiway. Beyond {@link RUNWAY_GEOM_MAX_ANCHOR_OFFSET_M} the row is
 *      refused. 1 row, and it is the 36 km one.
 *
 * Note what is NOT refused: the 440 m grass helicopter lane `08H/26H` that
 * makes Charles de Gaulle report `count: 5`. The file header apologises for
 * that number in prose. Drawn to scale beside four strips of 2 700 to 4 215 m,
 * it explains itself — which is the better fix.

/* ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * FOOTPRINT — the ground under the field, from the IGN
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * WHY A SECOND SOURCE AT ALL
 * --------------------------
 * The runway geometry above is the shape this pack could publish, and the
 * header on it states the asymmetry that shape has: `geom` reaches 93 % of the
 * world's large airports and 7.9 % of the French `airfield` tier — the half of
 * the pack that no global source answers, and the reason clause (c) exists.
 * OurAirports never georeferenced the aéroclubs. The IGN did: `BDTOPO_V3`
 * publishes the aerodrome as a surveyed POLYGON, and it is under the same
 * Licence Ouverte 2.0 as every other Géoplateforme layer in this repo.
 *
 * So a field that has no drawn runway can still have a drawn shape, and the
 * measured effect of the join is exactly that: 417 fields receive a footprint
 * and 212 of them had NO geometry of any kind before — 206 aéroclubs, 5
 * scheduled airports, 1 unscheduled.
 *
 * THE JOIN, AND WHY IT IS NOT SPATIAL FIRST
 * -----------------------------------------
 * BD TOPO carries `code_icao`, so 377 of the 417 are joined on a published key
 * with no geometry involved. The other 40 come from the second clause — the
 * field's own point lies INSIDE an unkeyed footprint — which exists because
 * 802 of the 1 126 French `airfield` features have no ICAO code at all (they
 * ship a `localCode`), and refusing them would drop the join to the terrains
 * the state already numbers.
 *
 * Measured on the 2026-09-09 retrieval, over the 447 candidate footprints:
 * every containment hit was UNIQUE — no footprint contained two packed fields
 * and no field fell inside two footprints — so the second clause never has to
 * pick a winner. {@link FOOTPRINT_MAX_ANCHOR_OFFSET_M} is the guard that keeps
 * the key clause honest instead: the offset between a field's published point
 * and the centre of the footprint it claims runs 154 m at the median, 537 m at
 * p95 and 1 383 m at the worst (LFOK, Châlons-Vatry), so a kilometres-wide
 * disagreement is a bad join and not a big airport.
 *
 * THE TWO REFUSALS ON THE FOOTPRINT ITSELF
 * ----------------------------------------
 *   1. NATURE. BD TOPO's `aerodrome` class is 1 370 objects, and 704 of them
 *      are héliports — hospital pads, fire stations, gendarmerie yards. The
 *      pack admits a heliport only when it has an ICAO code (clause (d)), so
 *      those footprints would have almost nothing to attach to. Only
 *      {@link FOOTPRINT_NATURES} is read.
 *   2. AREA. 830 of the 1 370 objects are a 5.2 m × 5.2 m square — a point
 *      wearing a polygon's clothes, including 147 objects the file calls
 *      `Aérodrome`. Drawn, they would be an invisible speck that still claims
 *      to be a surveyed outline, which is A1's exact failure. One hectare is
 *      the floor. Measured over the 666 objects of the three admitted natures:
 *      219 fall under it, and 205 of those are the 25 m² square. The floor does
 *      NOT sit in a gap, though — the largest refusal is 9 891 m² against a
 *      smallest admission of 10 208 m² — so it is a round number cutting a
 *      continuum, and the 14 real outlines between 169 m² and 9 892 m² are the
 *      price. A footprint that small is under a pixel at any range where its
 *      pastille is still on screen.
 *
 * WHAT THE JOIN LEAVES OUT, AND IT IS NOT NOTHING
 * -----------------------------------------------
 * 30 candidate footprints — 1 457 ha — attach to nothing. They are mostly
 * MILITARY: BD TOPO models the civil and the military side of one field as two
 * objects and puts the ICAO code on the civil one only. The largest is the
 * Base d'Aéronautique Navale de Lann Bihoué, 767 ha, sharing its runway with
 * LFRH Lorient-Bretagne Sud 579 m away. Attaching it would mean guessing that
 * two nearby polygons are one field, which is the kind of guess this pack does
 * not make — so Lorient draws its civil apron and the naval base stays dark,
 * and that is said out loud rather than papered over.
 *
 * Three footprints carry a FOREIGN indicator — LSGG Genève, LESO Saint-
 * Sébastien, SMTA Lawa Tabiki — because the IGN maps the French slice of an
 * airport whose terminal is over the border. The key clause accepts them: it
 * is the same field, and the pack's own feature for LSGG is Swiss.

/*
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * IMPORTANCE — one question, asked once: is a seat sold here?
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * Seven thousand identical dots is a wall, not a map. The ladder that thins it
 * used to cross TWO axes — OurAirports' editorial size bucket and the
 * scheduled-service flag — and it read `large_airport` BEFORE `scheduled`. So
 * its four steps changed subject as you descended them: size, then service,
 * then size again. It also seated Paris-Le Bourget, which sells no scheduled
 * seat at all, at the top of a ladder whose LIGNES chip promised "terrains
 * desservis par une ligne régulière". 22 fields worldwide made that promise
 * false, and Le Bourget was not an edge case to patch — it was the symptom.
 *
 * The ladder asks ONE question now, and it is the hard one:
 *
 *     `scheduled` — is a ticket sold here? Not an editorial judgement. A
 *                   timetabled service calls, or it does not.
 *
 * The two steps under it are not a second axis sneaking back in. They are the
 * SELECTION POLICY made visible: clause (a) admits the world's large and medium
 * airports, clause (c) admits the French long tail and nothing else. The fields
 * with no scheduled service therefore split exactly where the pack's own
 * COVERAGE splits — one worldwide step, one France-only step — and the reader
 * is looking at the shape of the pack rather than at a second opinion on size.
 *
 * WHY SIZE IS NOT ON THIS LADDER ANY MORE
 * ---------------------------------------
 * `type` is a PROXY for runway length — the file header says so, and the
 * shipped pack proves it. Median longest runway: 3 048 m for `large_airport`,
 * 2 050 m for `medium_airport`, 1 037 m for `small_airport` — landing on the
 * 3 000 / 1 800 / 1 000 m thresholds {@link AIRPORT_LENGTH_CLASSES} already
 * draws with. Colouring by the bucket while sizing by the measurement was one
 * fact on two channels (A3), and the measurement is the better of the two.
 * Roissy still towers over the grass strip beside it — at 18 px against 6, in
 * published metres. `AIRPORT_TYPE_LABELS` keeps the bucket for the CARD, where
 * it is named and therefore honest.
 *
 * WHY `airfield` IS ENTIRELY FRENCH, AND WHY THAT IS NOT A BUG
 * -----------------------------------------------------------
 * Clause (c) is the ONLY one that admits a small field with no scheduled
 * service, and it is France-only. Measured on the shipped pack: of the 931
 * non-French small fields, hydrobases and balloonports, every single one is
 * here on clause (b) — a sold seat — and so ranks `airline`. The bottom step is
 * 1 126 features, 100 % French, by construction rather than by accident.
 *
 * ── THE TWO DISTANCES ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `cardMaxDistance` is how far out the NAME is still offered. `markerMaxDistance`
 * is how far out the MARK is drawn at all. The second exists because of the
 * paragraph above: a globe that draws all three steps from orbit reports a
 * French aerodrome density that is an artefact of the SELECTION, not of the
 * world. That is the second of A4's three empties.
 *
 * 900 km for `airfield` is derived, not chosen: France spans about 1 000 km, and
 * at ~870 km a 1 000 km span fills a 1080 px viewport. The aéroclubs therefore
 * arrive exactly when France is the subject of the frame, and not before. The
 * others are set to about 2.5× their card range, so the mark always precedes
 * the name it belongs to rather than arriving with it.
 *
 * Folding the old `hub` step into `airline` costs the one thing that step did
 * well: Roissy's name, readable from orbit, where `airline`'s own 3 000 km card
 * range would drop it. That range moves to the channel that now carries size —
 * a runway of 3 000 m or more lifts its OWN card and mark to 14 000 km, per
 * feature, in {@link airportRenderSpec}. 1 280 fields qualify against the 1 173
 * that used to, and not one of them is an aéroclub; see the refusal there.

/* ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * SIZE — the published runway length, on the channel B1 reserves for it
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * `longestM` is the longest OPEN runway, in metres, on 6 150 of the 7 464
 * features (82 %). Deciles over the shipped pack: 1 000 / 1 297 / 1 531 /
 * 1 829 / 2 100 / 2 435 / 2 601 / 3 000 / 3 353, min 8, max 5 120. It is an
 * absolute quantity — the one B1 says must take the size channel — and it is
 * the number that answers what a reader actually asks of an airfield: what can
 * land here.
 *
 * ── WHY CLASSES AND NOT A CONTINUOUS RADIUS ─────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The same reason `damsPack.js` gives: a disc's AREA is what a reader decodes,
 * so an honest continuous scale would need √, and over a 1:640 domain that
 * leaves the bottom half of the pack inside two pixels of each other. Four
 * declared classes beat a continuous scale nobody can read back. What the
 * diameter delivers is the ORDER — and only the order: the five rows that used
 * to print these bounds on the map are gone, and the metres are on the card
 * instead, in metres and with their surface, one click away on the field the
 * reader actually pointed at, which is where a QUANTITY is legible at all.
 *
 * The bounds are still FROZEN DOMAIN values (C1) — never quantiles of what is
 * on screen — and they are operational rather than statistical, which is what
 * keeps the ranking they produce the same one from one session to the next:
 *
 *     ≥ 3 000 m       1 280   17.2 %   long-courrier / gros-porteur
 *     1 800 – 2 999 m 2 577   34.5 %   moyen-courrier (l'A320 demande ~1 800 m)
 *     1 000 – 1 799 m 1 690   22.6 %   turbopropulseur, aviation d'affaires
 *     < 1 000 m         603    8.1 %   aviation légère
 *     non publiée     1 314   17.6 %
 *
 * Constant PIXELS, never world units: the renderer sets `PointGraphics.pixelSize`
 * and no `scaleByDistance`, so nothing composes with the 1/z the perspective
 * already applies (B2).
 *
 * ── THE PASTILLE IS THE RUNWAY SEEN WITHOUT ITS BEARING ─────────────────────
 *
 * The diameters here are the SAME ladder the renderer uses as the minimum
 * screen length of the drawn runway. That is not a coincidence to be tidied
 * away: far out, the pastille's diameter IS the runway's floored length, and
 * as the camera closes the runway grows out of it and takes over. One
 * measurement, one ladder, two ranges — LOD, not the duplicate encoding A3
 * forbids, because at any given distance only one of the two is legible.
 *
 * 8 px for the unmeasured ring sits between the 6 and the 9 on purpose: a ring
 * smaller than the smallest disc would still be read as "short", and "not
 * published" is not a short runway. The ring is also the one part of this
 * channel that still speaks WITHOUT a key — hollow is not a size — which is
 * why it survived the legend rows going away.
 */
