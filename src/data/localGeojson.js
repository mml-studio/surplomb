// The FRUSTUM gate answers "is this on the screen at all". Until it existed the
// only spatial test here was `EllipsoidalOccluder`, which asks whether a point
// is over the horizon — a hemisphere, not a viewport. Measured on this tree
// before the gate: at 120 km over Lyon, with the four bundled packs on, 10 178
// of 22 218 features were `show = true`. Ten thousand of those were on the far
// side of Europe, Africa or the Atlantic, batched into vertex buffers, culled
// again by Cesium every frame, and never once on screen. That single missing
// test is most of why the four packs together drew about one frame per second.
//
// The CELL budget answers "would a second mark here say anything". Above
// LOCAL_GLOBE_LOD_HEIGHT_M a screen cell is hundreds of kilometres wide, so the
// dots inside one have already merged into a blob; drawing 40 of them costs 40
// marks and shows one. Below that height the rule is deliberately NOT applied:
// a visitor at city range zoomed in to separate two neighbouring structures,
// and dropping one of them would answer the opposite of the question they put.
// That is the plan's "au-delà de 2 000 km, un point par cellule occupée ; en

/* ── DRAWN LINES: the runway regime ladder ──────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A pack may hand a feature a `lines` array — a list of published segments in
 * lon/lat, with an optional metre width. `local-airports` is the first caller:
 * OurAirports publishes both thresholds of a runway, which makes an airport the
 * one object in this loader that has a real oriented shape at true scale.
 *
 * ONE MARK, TWO FLOORS, THREE REGIMES — and it is continuous at both crossings,
 * because a floor that is already exceeded does nothing:
 *
 *   far     length floored to the feature's own pastille diameter, stroke at
 *           RUNWAY_MIN_STROKE_PX          → an oriented tick, graded by class
 *   mid     length TRUE, stroke still at the minimum
 *                                         → the runway, at its place and its cap
 *   near    length TRUE, stroke at the runway's own published metre width
 *                                         → the runway, at its size
 *
 * The far floor is the pastille's diameter on purpose: the mark never shrinks
 * below the dot it grew out of, and the two therefore say the same thing at the
 * moment they hand over (see AIRPORT_LENGTH_CLASSES).
 *
 * WHAT THIS IS NOT. The stroke is a screen width, so under a strongly oblique
 * camera it does not foreshorten the way a true ground ribbon would: near the
 * horizon a runway reads slightly too wide. Its LENGTH and its BEARING are
 * always the published ones, which is what the mark claims; the width is a
 * stroke, and a stroked centreline is not a surface. Drawing a real
 * ground-clamped ribbon would mean rebuilding thousands of shadow volumes on
 * every camera settle, which is not worth 45 m of apparent width.
 *
 * The segments are also NOT clamped to the terrain. They sit at the record's
 * sampled ground height — the same number the stem stands on, sampled at the
 * airport's own reference point within GROUND_SAMPLE_MAX_DISTANCE_M and left at
 * ellipsoid height beyond it. At 100 km a pixel is already 107 m, so the
 * un-sampled error is invisible; close in, on a field flat by construction, one
 * height for the whole strip is the right model.
 */

/* ── DRAWN FOOTPRINT: the ground regime ─────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A pack may also hand a feature a `footprint` — the outer rings of a surveyed
 * ground boundary, in lon/lat. `local-airports` is again the first caller, and
 * the outline does NOT come from the same publisher as the feature it lands on:
 * OurAirports has the identity and the runway, the IGN has the ground.
 *
 * IT IS NOT THE FEATURE'S OWN POLYGON, and that is the whole reason it needs a
 * channel of its own. `applyLocalSurfaceStyle` styles the polygon Cesium parsed
 * out of the GeoJSON, which for a datacenter IS the record. Here the record is
 * a POINT — the field's published reference point, the one every runway segment
 * is measured against — and moving the anchor onto the outline's centre would
 * shift 418 pastilles by 154 m at the median and 1 382 m at the worst. So the
 * entity keeps its position and gains a polygon.
 *
 * ONE FLOOR, TWO REGIMES:
 *
 *   far     not drawn at all — the outline is under
 *           FOOTPRINT_MIN_SCREEN_PX across
 *   near    drawn, clamped to the terrain, at true ground scale
 *
 * There is no stretched-symbol regime the way `lines` has one, and that is the
 * point: a runway floored to its pastille's diameter is still an oriented tick
 * that says something true about bearing, while a footprint floored to a few
 * pixels is a blob that says only "an airport is here" — which the pastille
 * already says, better and cheaper. Below the floor the polygon is hidden and
 * the mark reverts to being a dot, with nothing lost.
 *
 * ONE COLOUR FOR ALL OF THEM, never the tier's. Cesium colours a batched ground
 * primitive by each instance's bounding RECTANGLE rather than by its polygon,
 * so two overlapping boxes in different colours bleed into each other —
 * measured once in this pack: Marseille-Provence's box overlaps the Berre
 * seaplane base's, and they sit in different tiers. The tier is already on the
 * pastille; repeating it under the polygon would be a second encoding of one
 * fact (A3) with a rendering bug attached.

 * Apply one render spec's SURFACE half to a Cesium polygon.

 *
 * ── WHY `height = 0` IS SET EXPLICITLY ──────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `GeoJsonDataSource.load({clampToGround: true})` leaves both `height` and
 * `heightReference` undefined, which makes the polygon a ground-classification
 * primitive. Extruding it needs the terrain-relative pair instead — and
 * Cesium's `GroundGeometryUpdater.getGeometryHeight()` emits a one-time
 * console warning and returns undefined if a `heightReference` arrives without
 * a `height` beside it. So the 0 is not decoration: it is what stops the
 * volume from being silently dropped.
 *
 * ── AND WHY THE FLAT SLAB IS FORCED MONOCHROME ──────────────────────────────
 *
 * A batched `GroundPrimitive` colours each instance by its bounding RECTANGLE,
 * not its polygon, so a per-feature ramp on this class bleeds across
 * neighbours. The class is NOT monochrome by construction — that was a claim
 * this header made and the data disproved: `datacenterRenderSpec` emits
 * `surface: 'flat'` for both the 2 739 halls and the 317 site outlines, in two
 * different colours, and a site outline encloses the halls it surrounds. So
 * the class takes ONE colour, declared by the pack as `surfaceColor`, and the
 * per-feature hue stays on the anchor mark, which is a point and outside the
 * batch. The richer fix — drawing a site outline as a clamped POLYLINE, which
 * is what a fence is — is left open; it needs a second geometry in this
 * loader, not a colour rule.
 *
 * ── WHAT THIS DOES NOT SOLVE ────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `RELATIVE_TO_GROUND` is relative to the GLOBE's terrain, not to a photoreal
 * tileset: over 3D Tiles a volume stands on the terrain surface and the mesh's
 * own roof stands wherever it was photographed, so the two interpenetrate.
 * Cesium's geometry updaters have no 3D-Tiles height reference — only
 * billboards and points do — and the alternative (sampling each footprint
 * against the tileset at load) would make 3 517 async samples a precondition
 * of drawing anything. The flat slabs this layer already drew have had the
 * same limit since they were clamped; the volume does not make it worse.

   * Capping in METRES fixes it without giving up the device: below the cap the
   * stem still lifts the mark clear of the mesh, and above it the mark simply
   * sits on its field. 150 m is under the 300 m (1 000 ft AGL) traffic-pattern

   * ── AND WHY EACH ENTRY OWNS ITS MATERIAL ────────────────────────────────
   *
   * `Polyline._destroy()` calls `this._material.destroy()`, and Cesium's

   * therefore destroyed once per polyline, and the SECOND one throws — so a
