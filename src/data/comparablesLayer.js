/**
 * Comparables — the dossier a valuation note is written from, and the map of it.
 *
 * WHY THIS LAYER EXISTS AT ALL. The Cityscan teardown (#99) took the competitor apart
 * and found that the one module we had nothing for — comparables — is not a
 * data problem. Their own public translation file names its source:
 * « Sélection de votre conseiller(ère) parmi les portails d'annonces ». There
 * is no listing database behind that screen. There is a screen. So this layer
 * is the screen, plus the two things the competitor's version does not do:
 * it never averages an asking price with a sale, and it never prints a number
 * without the sample it came from.
 *
 * NOTHING IS BOUGHT AND NOTHING IS SCRAPED. Owner decision, 2026-09-08: this
 * fork is going open source, so a paid listing feed (Yanport, PriceHubble,
 * Casafari) is out — a licence nobody who clones the repository could exercise
 * is not a dependency, it is a wall. Extraction is out for a harder reason,
 * with a price list attached: see the jurisprudence recorded in
 * `comparablesDossier.js`. What is left is what the competitor actually does,
 * and it costs nothing: the advisor chooses.
 *
 * ── HOW IT IS BUILT, AND WHY ON THE ADDRESS-SCAN SHELL ─────────────────────
 *
 * The shell does four things this layer would otherwise have to reinvent
 * badly: it seats markers on the terrain the globe is DRAWING (the 83-pixel
 * parallax `addressScanLayer.js` documents), it owns the click that opens a
 * card, it gates on altitude, and it holds a SCAN PIN. That last one is the
 * whole reason the fit is exact: a dossier belongs to one property, not to
 * wherever the camera drifted to, and `setScanPin()` is the mechanism that was
 * already there for it. Before a property is posed the layer follows the
 * camera and offers whatever DVF sells around the look-at point; the moment
 * one is posed, the scan pins to it and stops moving — including above the
 * altitude ceiling, which a pinned scan is exempt from, because a dossier is
 * not something that should disappear when you pull back to see the city.
 *
 * THE VIRTUAL ENDPOINT AND THE ONE REQUEST IT MAKES. `gev:comparables` is not
 * a route; {@link comparablesFetch} intercepts it, the way the fiche's does.
 * It fetches `/api/dvf` around the scan point and joins the dossier held in
 * this module. Editing the dossier changes the fetch's query string — the
 * revision counter is in it — which is what makes the shell redraw, because
 * its guard compares that string. The DVF half is memoised per point and
 * radius, so twelve edits in a row cost one request and eleven joins.
 *
 * ── WHAT IS DRAWN, AND WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT ────────────────────────────
 *
 * Drawn: the property, the retained comparables, and a line from the property
 * to each of them. That IS the dossier — a reader sees the sample the estimate
 * was built on, and how far it had to reach.
 *
 * NOT drawn: the candidate sales. The DVF layer next door already draws
 * exactly those mutations, coloured by what they say about the local market,
 * and drawing them again here in a second colour would put the same fact on
 * screen twice in two encodings — A3, one channel one information, at the
 * scale of the map rather than of a symbol. The pool is a list in the panel;
 * the map is the selection.
 *
 * THE TWO CHANNELS ON A MARKER, and they are orthogonal by construction:
 *
 *   · SHAPE and COLOUR say which instrument measured it. A retained mutation
 *     keeps the euro sign the DVF layer wears, because it IS that register; a
 *     keyed-in listing wears the price tag added to `addressMarkerIcons.js`
 *     for it. An intention and an observation never draw the same picture.
 *   · ALPHA says how old the measurement is (A2), floor at
 *     {@link OLDEST_ALPHA} so nothing ever fades to invisible.
 *
 * And a comparable whose date is UNKNOWN is not quietly given the oldest
 * alpha and left to look like a two-year-old sale: its connector is DASHED.
 * A1 names the remedy — « glyphe fantôme, contour pointillé, mention
 * explicite » — and a dashed line is the one this layer can afford.
