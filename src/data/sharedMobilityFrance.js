/**
 * @module sharedMobilityFrance
 *
 * French shared mobility — the bikes, e-bikes, scooters, mopeds and shared
 * cars waiting to be picked up, from the GBFS feeds published on the Point
 * d'Accès National (`transport.data.gouv.fr`).
 *
 * WHAT THIS IS, AND WHAT IT IS NOT. This is an INVENTORY, not a track. The
 * GBFS spec is explicit: *"Vehicles that are part of an active rental MUST NOT
 * appear in this feed."* A vehicle being ridden is invisible — it disappears
 * when unlocked and reappears wherever it is parked. So nothing here glides
 * the way a bus does in `transitFrance.js`; the fleet BLINKS, and pretending
 * otherwise by interpolating between two sightings would be inventing a
 * journey that the feed deliberately does not publish.
 *
 * HOW IT AVOIDS DRAWING THE SAME THING TWICE. Three separate redundancies are
 * resolved before a point reaches the screen, all of them measured rather than
 * assumed (see `gbfsFeeds.js` and `scripts/build-gbfs-fr-index.mjs`):
 *
 *   1. The catalog lists one system many times — 165 resources, 135 distinct
 *      systems. Duplicates are identified by the SET OF PLACES a system
 *      reports, which survives different URLs, hosts and GBFS versions.
 *   2. Four systems are already drawn by `bikeshare.js` (Vélib', Vélo'v,
 *      vélÔToulouse, Le Vélo TBM) and are excluded here rather than doubled.
 *   3. Free-floating operators republish the city's own parking bays as their
 *      "stations" — 26,259 rows over Paris alone, near-identical between
 *      operators. Those are not drawn per operator; the fleet is.
 *   4. An operator alone in its city escapes rule 3 and draws its whole bay
 *      map, most of it empty: Pony put 447 empty bays over Biarritz against 94
 *      holding a bike. A VIRTUAL bay with a published zero is not drawn — it
 *      is a polygon, not infrastructure — while an empty physical dock always
 *      is (`isEmptyVirtualBay`). Both counts are declared in the control row.
 *
 * NAMES ARE CHECKED AGAINST THEIR OWN KEY. Ten Pony systems publish
 * `station_id` in the `name` field — 4,959 rows nationwide — which filled a
 * whole city with `basque_country_parking` repeated. `gbfsFeeds.js` refuses
 * the echo, and a nameless dot is called by its operator instead.
 *
 * FRESHNESS IS UNEVEN AND SAID SO. Measured 2026-08-26: Lime republishes every
 * ~50 s, Dott's median fix is 8 minutes old with a tail past 2 hours. The card
 * prints the age of the vehicle's own last report, never the age of the poll.

// --- Presentation -----------------------------------------------------------
//
// THREE MARKS, THREE QUESTIONS. A viewport over Paris holds Lime, Dott and Voi
// in the same streets, publishing bikes, e-bikes, scooters and mopeds side by
// side — 2,175 vehicles on the landing's view alone. Since 2026-09-21 (the
// « Repères discrets » mock) they are drawn in two tiers:
//
//   DOT  — WHO, and HOW MANY. Every vehicle is a small dot in its operator's
//          hue (`mobilityOperators.js`), so the density of a street reads at
//          a glance and costs one point each.
//   PIN  — WHAT it is. A few vehicles, never two within 200 px of each other
//          on screen, wear a pin over their dot with their silhouette
//          (`sharedMobilityPins.js`, `sharedMobilityIcons.js`). Pins only come
//          in close to the street; from higher up the dots say it all.
//   GROUP — HOW MANY, from the city-wide view. Where the view is dense the
//          proxy counts the vehicles on its grid and each group is a bubble:
//          the proxy's count and a bar of its operators
//          (`sharedMobilityClusters.js`). Pressed, it zooms in.
//   RING — A STATION is a dark disc RINGED in its operator's hue, holding a
//          core of the same hue as large as it is full (`mobilityDockMark`):
//          large, small, or none — the one number a rider acts on, and one no
//          vehicle has. The dark disc is also what tells it from a vehicle.
//
// The 20 px plate every vehicle wore until then — silhouette, operator hue
// and, up close, a monogram — was the right mark for ONE vehicle and a carpet
// for two thousand: over the landing's view it covered the street it stood on.

 * FAMILIES, NOT HALVES. Until 2026-09-21 this was a pair, « Vélos » and « Le
 * reste », which over Paris put 36 YEGO scooters and a handful of Clem' cars
 * under one word. A family is the silhouette the map already draws, so the
 * control and the marks agree. A VAE is still a bike: `vehicleKindFromType()`
 * splits `bicycle` by propulsion, and a « Vélos » that hid every e-bike would
 * be lying about its own name.
 *
 * `other` — a form factor GBFS declines to name — belongs to no family: it is
 * drawn under « Tous » and under nothing else, rather than filed wrong.
 *
 * The key shows a segment only for a family that has something on screen:
 * Paris has no trottinette since 2023, and a « Trottinettes » that blanks the

   *     all while a single family is. It replaces the two row chips (« Vélos »,

   *   « Fournisseurs » — a dot in the operator's hue and its NAME. The dot
   *     alone was the ChatGPT mock's; 84 operators share 17 hues, and a key
   *     that makes the reader guess is not a key. Each line is its own switch:
   *     pressing it shows that operator only, on this layer and — fanned out —
   *     on the Vélib' docks of the same row; pressing it again brings
   *     everything back, and « Tout afficher » does when the focus came from
   *     the other block. No request: the filter is drawn from the answer in
   *     hand.
   *   « Stations » — the fill of a dock, only when a dock is on screen.

   * WHAT WENT. The SHAPE rows (« VAE 5.2K · Scooter 797 ») — a silhouette is
   * read without a key, and the segments now name the families; the channel
   * captions « forme = quoi » / « couleur + lettre = qui »; and the note « Le
