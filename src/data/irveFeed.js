/**
 * IRVE feed projection — the seam between ODRÉ's `bornes-irve` records and
 * what the browser is served.
 *
 * Lives here rather than inside `vite.config.js` for the same reason
 * `eco2mixFeed.js` does: this file is a consolidation of ~180 separate
 * publishers' spreadsheets, and almost every field disagrees with itself
 * somewhere. Only a test against a real captured payload keeps the reading
 * honest. The dev-server proxy imports `projectIrveSites`; nothing in the
 * browser bundle does.
 *
 * ── What the dataset IS ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The *fichier consolidé des bornes de recharge pour véhicules électriques* —
 * a STATIC REGISTER of where France's public charge points are declared to be,
 * assembled daily by transport.data.gouv.fr from the operators' own IRVE
 * filings and republished on ODRÉ under Licence Ouverte 2.0. Measured
 * 2026-08-27: **231 079 points de charge**, one row per *point de charge*
 * (a single plug-and-pay position), not one row per station.
 *
 * ── What it is NOT ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * It is not an availability feed. Nothing in these 231 079 rows says whether a
 * charge point is free right now, working, or occupied — that lives in each
 * operator's own OCPI endpoint, behind a contract. So this layer never draws a
 * "N bornes libres" count and never colours a site green-for-available: it
 * draws INSTALLED CAPACITY, and says so.
 *
 * **That is still true of the MAP, and since 2026-09-09 it is no longer true
 * of the CARD.** QualiCharge — the DGEC's aggregation API, compulsory for any
 * DC operator claiming renewable certificates — does publish the live state,
 * and `irveLive.js` joins it to these sites through a plug→coordinate table
 * built from the register's own flat export. The colours, the bands and the
 * counts on this map are unchanged; what a selected site gains is one more
 * line, carrying its own source, its own denominator and its own age. See
 * `irveLive.js` for the 9.34 % of plug ids that name two places and are
 * therefore refused a placement.
 *
 * ── Trap 1: the published geometry is unusable, twice over ──────────────────
 * `geo_point_borne` is NULL on all 231 079 rows (measured), so Opendatasoft's
 * `within_bbox()` cannot be used at all — the viewport filter has to be a
 * numeric predicate on the consolidated columns.
 *
 * Worse, `coordonneesxy` is LABELLED BACKWARDS: its `lon` key holds the
 * latitude and its `lat` key holds the longitude, on **every row checked**
 * (32 091/32 091 across Île-de-France). A reader who trusts the key names puts
 * Gennevilliers off the coast of Somalia. Only `consolidated_latitude` /
 * `consolidated_longitude` are read here, and `coordonneesxy` is never touched.
 *
 * ── Trap 2: the station id fragments the station ────────────────────────────
 * `id_station_itinerance` cannot be the render unit. Q-Park's Grande Arche car
 * park at La Défense publishes **127 distinct station ids at one coordinate**,
 * one per charge point; Interparking Clichy-Montmartre publishes 82. And 1 192
 * rows nationally publish the literal string `"Non concerné"` as their station
 * id, spread across coordinates up to 55 km apart. The render unit here is
 * therefore THE COORDINATE (rounded to ~1 m), and a site is described as "N
 * points de charge published at this point" rather than as a station.
 *
 * `nbre_pdc` — the operator's own declared count — is not used either: only
 * 2 641 of 6 272 Île-de-France stations have it agreeing with the number of
 * rows actually published (Bump's Lobau station declares 203 and publishes
 * 229; one Citeo station declares 10 and publishes 1). Counting the rows that
 * exist is a fact; repeating a declaration that contradicts them is not.
 *
 * ── Trap 3: the same charge points are published twice ──────────────────────
 * Measured over Île-de-France: **442 of 3 812 sites (11.6%) carry two or more
 * "operators" publishing an IDENTICAL power profile at the same point**, worth
 * 2 392 charge points — 7.5% of the area's total — that a naive sum counts
 * twice. The pairs are unambiguous: TotalEnergies Charging Services with
 * TotalEnergies Marketing France (378 sites), SPIE CITYNETWORKS with SPIE
 * CityNetworks (107, pure case), ENGIE Vianeo with its Greenflux back end
 * (35), E-TOTEM with E-Totem, ELECTRA with Electra. Only 3 of the 576 clusters
 * were a single charge point, so the test is precise rather than lucky.
 *
 * Identical profiles collapse to one; overlapping ones never do. Both figures
 * travel to the client — `pdcPublished` is what the file says, `pdcDistinct`
 * is what is drawn — and the collapsed names are named on the card.
 *
 * ── Trap 4: kilowatts that are watts ────────────────────────────────────────
 * `puissance_nominale` is kW per the IRVE schema, and 6 981 rows nationally
 * (3.0%) are outside any envelope a charge point can occupy: 5 315 publish
 * ≤ 0 kW, and 1 666 publish more than 400 kW — headed by 771 rows at exactly
 * 7 360 and 90 at 3 680, which are 7.36 kW and 3.68 kW expressed in watts.
 *
 * Those are NOT rescaled. Dividing 7 360 by a thousand is a guess that happens
 * to be right, and the same guess turns a genuine 600 kW bank into 0.6 kW.
 * They go to an explicit `inconnue` band — counted, named, never painted as a
 * power — and the card still prints the published figure verbatim.
 *
 * ── Trap 5: eight spellings of a boolean ────────────────────────────────────
 * `gratuit`, `prise_type_*` and `station_deux_roues` are published as
 * `"True"`, `"true"`, `"TRUE"`, `"False"`, `"false"`, `"FALSE"`, `"1"`, `"0"`
 * and null — all nine forms measured in one Île-de-France pull. In JavaScript
 * `Boolean("False")` is `true`, so a plain coercion reports every paid site as
 * free and fits every socket with a CCS plug.
 *
 * ── Trap 6: mojibake, in a closed vocabulary ────────────────────────────────
 * A handful of publishers ship text whose accents were decoded through the
 * wrong table: `"Acc\x8fs libre"` (Mac Roman read as Latin-1, 48 rows in
 * Île-de-France), plus rarer `"Accčs libre"` and `"Acc¸s libre"`. Left alone
 * they split one legend row into four.
 *
 * Two repairs, in order. The C1 range 0x80–0x9F can never legitimately appear
 * in a name, so those code points are re-read through Mac Roman — an exact,
 * reversible fix. Then `condition_acces`, `implantation_station` and
 * `accessibilite_pmr` are matched to the IRVE schema's own closed vocabulary
 * on their ASCII skeleton, which folds every remaining mangling of a known
 * value onto that value without guessing at any character. A value that
 * matches nothing passes through as published.
 *
 * ── Trap 7: "not verified" is not "wrong" ───────────────────────────────────
 * `consolidated_is_lon_lat_correct` is False on 37% of the file, and reading
 * that as "bad coordinate" would discard a third of France. It is False in two
 * quite different situations, separable because the consolidation fills
 * `consolidated_commune` only when it verified the INSEE code:
 *
 *   False + no commune  → 80 545 rows the pipeline could not CHECK. Kept.
 *   False + commune     →  5 361 rows whose coordinate contradicts a commune
 *                          the pipeline DID verify. Withheld, and counted.
 *   True                → 145 173 rows verified against their commune. Kept.
 *
 * The withheld class is not theoretical: QOVOLTIS publishes "Route du
 * Baganais", verified commune Le Porge (Gironde), at −44.996 / +44.996 — south
 * of Madagascar. Plus 24 rows at exactly (0, 0), which are dropped outright.
 *
 * Dependency-free and side-effect-free (no Cesium, no DOM) so it runs
 * identically in the browser, in the Vite dev-server proxy, and under
 * `node --test`.
