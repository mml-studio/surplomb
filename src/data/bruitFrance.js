/**
 * @module data/bruitFrance
 *
 * The aircraft-noise plans of France, drawn — and the one decision this layer
 * exists to make out loud: WHICH of the zones the service returns is the answer.
 *
 * ── WHAT THIS ADDS OVER `urbanismeGpu` ──────────────────────────────────────
 * The Géoportail de l'urbanisme already reaches the plan d'exposition au bruit.
 * `DATA_SOURCES.md` says so, and it arrives there as a servitude: a code, an
 * assiette outline and a PDF link, drawn as a dashed line at the address, with
 * NO zone letter, NO threshold and NO unit. Over the same ground at Roissy that
 * layer's whole answer is "servitude aéronautique". This layer's answer is
 * "gêne modérée : logements neufs limités, isolation imposée · de 56 à 65
 * dB(A) en moyenne sur 24 h · arrêté préfectoral du 03/04/2007 · LFPG". The
 * difference is the number, and the number is the reason anyone looks.
 *
 * ── THE DEFECT THIS LAYER WAS BUILT TO AVOID: `features[0]` ─────────────────
 * A WMS GetFeatureInfo is not a point-in-polygon test. GeoServer answers with
 * every feature within a buffer of the queried PIXEL, and the aircraft-noise
 * plans genuinely overlap. Measured on 2026-09-02, one probe at each of the 224
 * aerodromes in the arrêté register, at the scale `bruitFeed.js` pins:
 *
 *   features returned per probe   0 → 9   1 → 141   2 → 67   3 → 5   4 → 2
 *
 * So **74 of the 215 probes that answer at all — 34% — return more than one
 * polygon for one pixel**, and taking `features[0]` would be a coin toss on a
 * third of France. Three DISTINCT reasons sit behind that number, and they need
 * three different answers, not one:
 *
 *  1. THE SAME BAND, PUBLISHED TWICE. Measured at LFPZ, LFPV, LFXU and LFGQ:
 *     one zone comes back as two features with two `id_map` values, and at LFPZ
 *     the two copies even disagree about `producteur` (`DSAC N` against `ADP`)
 *     and `date_maj` (`null` against `2017-05-23Z`). `bruitFeed.js` merges them
 *     on the band's identity and counts the pieces. Nothing here has to know.
 *
 *  2. A BAND THE BUFFER FOUND, THAT THE POINT IS NOT IN. Measured at Les
 *     Mureaux (LFXU): 4 features come back, and the two zone-A polygons are
 *     BESIDE the probe, not under it. `bruitFeed.js` re-tests every ring, holes
 *     included, and flags `atPoint`. Those bands are drawn — "the louder zone
 *     starts thirty metres away" is worth seeing — but they are DASHED, drawn
 *     at the faintest wash, and can never be the answer.
 *
 *  3. TWO BANDS THAT REALLY DO BOTH COVER THE POINT. This is the one that needs
 *     a rule. Measured by probing each airport's whole plan and re-testing it on
 *     a 120 × 120 grid of its own bbox:
 *       · LFPZ (Saint-Cyr) — zones **A and B overlap**; at 48.80989, 2.07921
 *         all four returned polygons contain the point (A id 649, A id 652,
 *         B id 650, B id 653) and zone B has no hole cut where zone A sits.
 *       · LFMD (Cannes-Mandelieu) — zones **B and C overlap** at 43.53184,
 *         6.95601.
 *       · LFPB (Le Bourget) — **two different airports**: Le Bourget's own
 *         zone A and Roissy's zone D, two arrêtés twelve years apart.
 *
 * ── THE RULE, AND WHY IT IS THE STRICTEST ZONE ──────────────────────────────
 * {@link chooseBruitAnswer} ranks the eligible bands and the card NAMES the
 * clause that separated the winner from the runner-up. In order:
 *
 *   1. `atPoint` — a band the point is not inside is not a candidate at all.
 *   2. THE MOST EXPOSED ZONE WINS. A/B/C/D on the PEB, I/II/III on the PGS.
 *      This is not a tie-break dressed up as a rule: the PEB's restrictions are
 *      cumulative-strictest, so on ground covered by both A and B it is zone A
 *      that forbids housing. Answering "zone B" at Saint-Cyr because it came
 *      back first would understate the rule that actually applies there. The
 *      letters are also the ONE part of the document that is identical at every
 *      airport and under both indices, so ranking them compares like with like
 *      even where the thresholds do not.
 *   3. Tie on the letter → the NEWEST effective arrêté, because a revised plan
 *      supersedes the one it replaced. Never observed in the 224-airport sweep;
 *      written down because the day it happens the alternative is arbitrary.
 *   4. Still tied → the OACI code, alphabetically, then the feature id. Two
 *      clauses that decide nothing about physics and everything about
 *      determinism: the same ground must not answer differently because
 *      GeoServer shuffled its response.
 *
 * Everything the rule did NOT pick is still on the card. `{n} zones sous le
 * repère`, the runner-up spelled out with its own band, and the count of the
 * ones the buffer found beside the point. A layer that picks silently is a
 * layer that is wrong 34% of the time without saying so.
 *
 * ── THE UNIT IS NEVER GUESSED, AND THAT WORK IS ALREADY DONE ────────────────
 * `indldenext`/`indldenint` mix two incompatible scales — the *indice
 * psophique* abandoned in 2002 and Lden dB(A) — with nothing in the row to tell
 * them apart. Measured over the 298 zone rows the 224 probes returned:
 * 75 rows carry psophique values (78 … 96) and 223 carry Lden (50 … 70).
 * `bruitFeed.js` chooses from the LATER of `date_arret` and the date inside the
 * arrêté PDF, and suppresses the unit rather than guessing when the two
 * disagree. This module's contribution is narrower and just as load-bearing:
 * **it never renders a bare number.** Every threshold on screen arrives through
 * {@link bandText}, which returns null when the index is unsettled, and the
 * band then prints as "seuils 84 – 89 — indice non déterminé". A number with no
 * unit beside it is read as decibels by everyone.
 *
 * ── WHAT IS NOT DRAWN, AND WILL NOT BE ──────────────────────────────────────
 * THERE IS NO STRATEGIC NOISE MAP HERE. The EU directive's CBS isophones — the
 * thing most people mean by "the noise map" — are not on the Géoplateforme at
 * all: grepping all three capabilities documents for bruit/noise/classement
 * returns these four DGAC aviation layers and nothing else. They exist as ~76
 * per-DDT Géo-IDE ATOM shapefile zips, EPSG:2154, ISO-8859-1, no CORS header,
 * and one of them (Tarn) is MapInfo TAB with no shapefile inside at all. That
 * is a server-side harvest of several hundred archives, and it is deferred, not
 * forgotten. ROAD AND RAIL NOISE ARE THEREFORE ABSENT FROM THIS LAYER, and the
 * card says "avions seulement" rather than letting a reader infer that the
 * quiet ground beside a motorway is quiet.
 *
 * ── TWO MODES, BECAUSE A DEZOOMED CAMERA ASKS A DIFFERENT QUESTION ──────────
 * A PEB is a set of NESTED RINGS and a point probe returns the one the pixel
 * is in — normally zone A, at the aerodrome — because GetFeatureInfo answers
 * within a few pixels of the coordinate. That is the right answer to "what
 * applies to this address" and the wrong answer to "show me the noise around
 * this airport": zones B, C and D are donuts the point is not inside, so from
 * a dezoomed camera the layer drew one band out of four and then, above 12 km,
 * nothing at all. The plans themselves are up to 65.8 km across; the ceiling
 * was under a fifth of that, so the shape could never be on screen whole.
 *
 * So above {@link ADDRESS_SCAN_CEILING_M} the layer switches question:
 *
 *   POINT MODE, below 12 km — unchanged. One probe at the camera's coordinate,
 *     pinned at 1:{@link BRUIT_PROBE_SCALE_DENOMINATOR}, `atPoint` re-tested,
 *     the winner rule, the runner-up, the dashes, the marker. Everything the
 *     rest of this header is about.
 *   OVERVIEW MODE, 12 km to {@link BRUIT_OVERVIEW_CEILING_M} — one probe per
 *     AERODROME in view, at its own published reference point, at
 *     1:{@link BRUIT_AREA_SCALE_DENOMINATOR}, whose buffer is wide enough that
 *     the whole plan comes back — and then a second pass that re-fetches each
 *     band it found at the fine scale, so the shape is as wide as the overview
 *     needs and as detailed as the point probe's. No marker, so no winner, no
 *     runner-up and no dashes: `atPoint` is false on every band because nothing
 *     was tested against a point, and drawing that as "you are not standing in
 *     it" would be an answer to a question nobody asked.
 *
 * The overview then has two TEMPOS, and only the tempo differs — the question,
 * the probes and the bands are identical:
 *
 *   Below {@link BRUIT_FINE_OVERVIEW_CEILING_M} the second pass runs IN FRONT
 *     of the reader. `fine=1` goes out with the request and the payload comes
 *     back already at 1:{@link BRUIT_PROBE_SCALE_DENOMINATOR}, so the frame a
 *     reader dezooms to in order to see one airport's plan is sharp on its
 *     first paint instead of arriving faceted and redrawing under them.
 *   Above it, the pass stays in the BACKGROUND exactly as it was: coarse first,
 *     sharpened band by band, {@link scheduleBruitRefinePoll} coming back for
 *     it. Four seconds of wait buys nothing at 100 km, where the median band is
 *     1.9 km wide against a 140 km screen.
 *
 * NEITHER TEMPO IS A PROMISE. The foreground pass is bounded by a wall-clock
 * budget the proxy owns, so a cold Paris basin under 30 km can still answer
 * with some bands coarse and the rest queued — which is why every sentence
 * about sharpness on a card is read off the BAND (`bruitBandIsFine`) and never
 * off the altitude.
 *
 * ── DRAWN AT A STATED GENERALISATION, AND THE OVERVIEW EARNS THE FINE ONE ───
 * The outline the service returns is generalised to the requested rendering
 * scale — 1:39,757 for a point probe, 1:3,975,696 for an overview, a hundred
 * times coarser. That is one knob doing two jobs: the coarse scale is what
 * makes the GetFeatureInfo buffer wide enough to return zones B, C and D at
 * all, and it is also what flattens them. Measured, Roissy's zone D came back
 * with 37 vertices across 65.8 km — a ring with visible facets.
 *
 * The two jobs are separated by fetching TWICE. The coarse probe is demoted to
 * a discovery pass that names the bands; each named band is then re-fetched at
 * the PROBE scale, aimed at its own coarse outline, which works because the
 * service does not clip the geometry it returns to the box it was asked
 * through. Measured over the twelve aerodromes around Paris, 751 vertices
 * became 7,287. The proxy owns that pass and its measurements; see the second-
 * pass header beside `bruitAerodromeZones` in `vite.config.js`.
 *
 * IT IS A BACKGROUND PASS ABOVE {@link BRUIT_FINE_OVERVIEW_CEILING_M}, so the
 * overview is drawn coarse first and sharpens under the reader a few seconds
 * later — nine and a half seconds of refinement across the Paris basin is not a
 * camera settle. Under that altitude the same pass is played in front of the
 * reader instead, against a budget that keeps the wait a wait rather than a
 * hang. {@link scheduleBruitRefinePoll} is how this layer
 * comes back for it, and {@link bruitCardCaveat} is why a half-refined view
 * still cannot overclaim: every band carries the scale its own outline was
 * fetched at, the card prints the COARSEST of them, and it names how many are
 * already better. Nothing drawn here is a surveyed limit at either scale; the
 * arrêté the card names — `arrêté préfectoral du <date> · <OACI>` — is the
 * document that is.
 *
 * ── WHY IT SITS ON `createAddressScanLayer` ─────────────────────────────────
 * The upstream takes a coordinate, not a bounding box, exactly like the four
 * layers already on that shell. Reusing it buys the look-at derivation, the
 * altitude gate, the 450 ms camera settle, the single-flight scan, the terrain
 * seating and the click-to-card index — about eight hundred lines this layer
 * would otherwise own a second copy of. What is added on top is the row legend
 * and the zoom guidance the shell does not have.
 *
 * THE OVERVIEW NEEDED NO CHANGE TO THAT SHELL, and that is not a coincidence.
 * The shell already refetches whenever the QUERY changes rather than only when
 * the centre moves — written for the urbanism layer, which asks for a box close
 * in and a point higher up — so a mode that adds one `km=` parameter above an
 * altitude switches itself, and the proxy reads that parameter to decide which
 * of the two questions it is being asked.

 * What this layer has to say about an arbitrary point of ground.

 * and a polygon entity carries no `position`, so `cardFromEntity` cannot build
 * a card for it and `scene.pick` at any pixel inside a band returns an entity
 * the click index has never heard of. Measured in the running app at 60 km over
 * Roissy: a pick on the aerodrome marker's own pixel returns
 * `bruit:peb:566:fill:0`, with the marker only SECOND in the drill list. So the
 * bands' outlines answered a click and their interiors — the whole coloured
 * surface a reader is looking at — answered nothing at all.
 *
 * THE ANSWER IS RE-DERIVED, NOT LOOKED UP. `atPoint` on a band is about the
 * coordinate the SCAN was aimed at, which is not where this click landed, and
 * in the overview it is false on every band because there was no scan point at
 * all. So every band is re-tested against the clicked coordinate with the same
 * `pointInPolygons` the feed uses, holes included — an enclave cut out of zone C
 * is ground where zone C does NOT apply, and answering "zone C" there would be
 * exactly the error the holes exist to prevent.
 *
 * AND IT SAYS WHAT IT WAS MEASURED AGAINST. This is a test against the drawn
 * outline, which is generalised — to 1:39,757 under a point scan and to
 * 1:3,975,696 in an overview, where a hundred metres of boundary is well under
 * a vertex. Near an edge that is a guess, and the card says so rather than
 * letting a coloured pixel pass for a legal limit.
 *
 * Returns null when no band contains the point, which the shell reads as
 * "declined": the click then falls through to dismissing whatever card is open,
 * because "there is no zone here" is not worth taking over the screen for.

 * {@link ADDRESS_SCAN_CEILING_M}, and it is the wrong way: the point scan owes
 * its sharpness to a probe pinned at 1e-4°/px, whose buffer is 11 m of ground,
 * and that buffer is exactly what makes it return ONE ring of a plan that has
 * four. Measured over a 25-aerodrome sample on 2026-09-02, distinct bands
 * returned: 37 at the probe scale against 88 at the overview's, and nine
 * aerodromes — Toussus, Chavenay and Le Plessis among them — answer NOTHING at
 * the fine scale at all. Extending the point mode to 30 km would buy a sharp
 * outline by dropping zones B, C and D on the way up.
 *
 * So the question stays the overview's — one probe per aerodrome, every band —
 * and what changes below this altitude is WHEN the second pass runs. Under
 * 30 km the proxy plays it in front of the reader and the payload arrives
 * already at 1:{@link BRUIT_PROBE_SCALE_DENOMINATOR}; above it the pass stays
 * in the background, exactly as before, and the outline sharpens a few seconds
 * later. Both are bounded: see `BRUIT_FINE_FOREGROUND_BUDGET_MS` in
 * `vite.config.js`, which is what stops a cold Paris basin from turning a
 * camera settle into a nine-second hang.
 *
 * 30 km is where the WAIT stops paying. The ground half-diagonal under a
 * default Cesium frustum is 0.7 × the altitude, so the view is about 42 km
 * across here — one aerodrome's plan and its neighbours, which is the frame a
 * reader dezooms to. At 60 km it is 84 km across, the median band (1.9 km
