/**
 * The layers a reader who has never chosen anything arrives with.
 *
 * ── Why the globe is not empty any more ───────────────────────────────────
 * Until now every boot with no share link and no stored session put the
 * reader on a photographic city with nothing happening on it, and the product
 * only became itself on their first toggle. The first thing a visitor should
 * see is the thing they came for: a city that is alive.
 *
 * ── Why THIS layer, and only this one ─────────────────────────────────────
 * Traffic is the only layer that is legible at the altitude the boot flight
 * lands on, moves on its own so the picture reads as live within a second,
 * and costs the SAME upstream request however many readers arrive — the
 * Overpass box is one cache cell for the whole default view
 * (`tierFetchBox`, and `scripts/qa-span-par-viewport.mjs` measures it at one
 * key across eleven window sizes), and TomTom's flow tiles are shared behind
 * a 120 s proxy TTL. A second default layer would be a second cold fetch on a
 * thread that has just finished landing an animation.
 *
 * ── What this cost before it was allowed ──────────────────────────────────
 * A layer that is on before the reader arrives works THROUGH the boot flight,
 * and that was measured to take the arrival from 6.4–6.8 s to 25.5–27.2 s
 * (`scripts/qa-traffic-boot.mjs`). `src/bootFlight.js` is what makes this
 * affordable: the layer waits out the descent and loads onto the parked view,
 * which is both the view the reader looks at and the one whose Overpass
 * answer is already warm. Re-measured with the gate in place, the arrival is
 * indistinguishable from an empty one.
 *
 * ── What it must never override ───────────────────────────────────────────
 * A default is not a preference. It applies only when there is no share state
 * AND no stored session, so a reader who switched traffic off keeps it off,
 * and a share link shows exactly what its sender framed — including a link
 * with no layers at all. See `start()`.

 * Layers that stay REGISTERED but are WITHDRAWN FROM THE INTERFACE.

 * A withdrawn layer keeps everything a layer has — its module, its entry in
 * this registry, its share token, its taxonomy row, its credit line, its QA
 * harness. What it loses is every way a reader can ASK for it: no row and no
 * chip in the Data Layers panel (`layerFusions.js` drops it from the row's
 * offered companions), no name the voice model may speak
 * (`voice/layerVocabulary.js`), and no resurrection at boot — which is this
 * file's half of the job.
 *
 * THE BOOT HALF IS WHY THIS LIST IS HERE AND NOT ONLY IN THE PANEL. A reader
 * who had the layer switched on before it was withdrawn carries that ON in
 * `localStorage`, and an old share link carries it in `l=`. Restoring either
 * would put a layer on the globe with no control anywhere to switch it off —
 * the one failure mode that is strictly worse than the layer existing. So the
 * ingested state is pruned before the restore runs.
 *
 * It is pruned on INGESTION ONLY, never in `normalizeLayerState`: an explicit
 * `setEnabled(id, true, { origin: 'user' })` still records and still encodes,
 * which is what keeps `scripts/qa-velo-pulse.mjs` and the layer's own tests
 * able to drive it. Withdrawn is a product decision about the interface, not a
