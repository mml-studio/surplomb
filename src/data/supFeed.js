 *
 * The reading of France's HIGHER-education register — the level
 * `schoolsFeed.js` stops before.
 *
 * ── Why this layer exists at all ────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The Annuaire de l'éducation is the MENJ's register and it ends at the
 * baccalauréat. Measured against the live file 2026-09-01, its
 * `type_etablissement` has exactly eight values — Ecole, Collège, Lycée, EREA,
 * Médico-social, Service Administratif, Information et orientation, Autre —
 * and **not one of them is a university, an IUT, an école d'ingénieurs, an
 * école de commerce, an IFSI or a school of architecture**. 45 of its 68 557
 * open rows carry `ministere_tutelle = ENSEIGNEMENT SUPERIEUR`, against some
 * six thousand post-bac establishments that actually exist. `schools-fr` is
 * not missing a few rows; it is missing a whole degree of education.
 *
 * The size of the hole, measured by joining the two registers on the UAI:
 * of the 6 509 establishments the ministry's Parcoursup cartography lists for
 * the 2026 session, **3 492 appear nowhere in the Annuaire**. The 3 017 that
 * do are almost all lycées (2 800 of them) hosting a BTS or a CPGE — see
 * "Trap 3" below, because those are the dots that will sit on top of
 * `schools-fr`'s and it matters that the map says why.
 *
 * ── What the dataset IS ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * `fr-esr-atlas_regional-effectifs-d-etudiants-inscrits-detail_etablissements`
 * — the MESR's own *Effectifs d'étudiants inscrits … détail par
 * établissements*, published on data.enseignementsup-recherche.gouv.fr under
 * **Licence Ouverte 2.0**. One row per (établissement × composante × degré
 * d'études). Measured at rentrée 2024, the newest published: **22 068 rows,
 * 6 294 establishments, 8 103 composantes, 3 027 462 students.**
 *
 * It is chosen over the two obvious alternatives on purpose.
 * `fr-esr-principaux-etablissements-enseignement-superieur` is the canonical
 * list and holds 245 rows — the *principaux*, which is a third of one percent
 * of the map this layer draws. `fr-esr-implantations_etablissements_d_
 * enseignement_superieur_publics` has 2 561 rows and was last modified in
 * **2017**. This one is rebuilt annually, carries the official 14-category
 * typology AND the enrolment, and is the only one that does all three.
 *
 * ── Trap 1: the register is a STATISTIC, so 1 665 of its establishments have
 *    no coordinate — and the fix is a second dataset, not a guess ────────────
 * `geo` is null on 3 442 of the 22 068 rows. Rolled up: **1 665 of the 6 294
 * establishments cannot be placed at all**, holding 130 480 students. Among
 * them are the Université de la Nouvelle-Calédonie (2 844) and the Université
 * de la Polynésie française (2 596) — two whole universities.
 *
 * They are not placed at their commune's centroid. The layer instead reads a
 * SECOND ministry file, `fr-esr-cartographie_formations_parcoursup` (session
 * 2026, Licence Ouverte 2.0, 25 831 formations, every one geolocated), and
 * borrows a coordinate ONLY where that file gives exactly one point for the
 * UAI. Measured: that is **977 establishments and 82 200 students**, lifting
 * placed enrolment from 95.69% to **98.41%**. Where Parcoursup gives several
 * points for an establishment the Atlas cannot place (119 establishments),
 * nothing is borrowed — picking one of several campuses is inventing a fact,
 * and the count is reported instead.
 *
 * The two universities above are what the rule looks like in practice: the
 * Université de la Polynésie française is recovered and appears on the map,
 * and the Université de la Nouvelle-Calédonie is NOT — Parcoursup does not
 * list New Caledonia, which runs its own admissions, so all 18 of the
 * territory's establishments stay in `unplaced` and are reported there rather
 * than invented into the Pacific.
 *
 * The borrowing is safe because it was checked rather than assumed. On the
 * 3 304 establishments where BOTH files give exactly one point, the median
 * disagreement is **74 m** and 90% agree within 1 km.
 *
 * ── Trap 2: an establishment is not a place ─────────────────────────────────
 * Aix-Marseille Université is one UAI and 59 coordinates. Drawing one dot per
 * establishment would put a 80 000-student university on a single street
 * corner; drawing one dot per row would draw the same campus seven times, once
 * per degree level. The unit here is therefore the **site** — one distinct
 * coordinate of one establishment — and the enrolment attached to it is the
 * sum over the composantes AT that coordinate, never the establishment's.
 *
 * A composante whose own `geo` is null inside an establishment that HAS other
 * coordinates is the residual case — **19 170 students, flagged on 376 of the
 * 6 914 sites** — and they are deliberately left unattributed rather than moved to the
 * establishment's largest site: pushing them there would inflate a real number
 * with an invented one. They are counted in `unsited` and stated on the card,
 * so a reader who adds the dots up and finds less than the establishment holds
 * can see the difference named.
 *
 * The register is an ENROLMENT file, which has one pleasant consequence worth
 * stating because it does not hold for `schools-fr`: a site exists here only
 * because students are counted at it, so all 6 914 of them carry a positive
 * roll. There is no "effectif non publié" case to draw, and dot size means the
 * same thing on every dot.
 *
 * ── Trap 3: 2 819 of these "establishments" are lycées ──────────────────────
 * BTS and CPGE are taught inside secondary schools, so the register's second
 * biggest category by count is `Lycées` — 2 819 establishments and 349 955
 * students, every one of which `schools-fr` already draws as a *Lycée* dot at
 * the same address. They are kept, because a map of where France's students
 * are that omitted a fifth of them would be a worse lie than a stacked dot.
 * They get their OWN band on the ladder so the legend names the overlap
 * instead of letting it look like a duplicate, and the card says which lycée.
 *
 * ── Trap 4: the roll is not a headcount of humans ───────────────────────────
 * `effectifhdccpge` is inscriptions *hors doubles comptes*, which is the
 * ministry's de-duplicated figure — a CPGE student enrolled at both a lycée
 * and a university is counted once. It is the right number and it is NOT
 * comparable to a naive sum of registrations; the card names the rentrée it
 * belongs to so it is never read as "today".
 *
 * Dependency-free and side-effect-free (no Cesium, no DOM) so it runs
 * identically in the browser, in the Vite dev-server proxy, and under
 * `node --test`.

 *
 *   universite   Universités (73) + Autre établissements d'enseignement
 *                universitaire (32) + Écoles normales supérieures (4). All
 *                three award national university diplomas; 4 ENS dots is not
 *                a legend row anyone can find.
 *   lycee        Lycées (2 819) — BTS and CPGE. Kept ALONE, because this is
 *                the band that overlaps `schools-fr` and merging it into
 *                anything would hide that.
 *   ingenieur    Écoles d'ingénieurs (109) + Écoles vétérinaires (5). Common
 *                post-CPGE competitive entry; 5 dots is not a legend row.
 *   commerce     Écoles de commerce, gestion et vente (434) + Écoles
 *                juridiques et administratives (32).
 *   sante        Écoles paramédicales hors université (439) + Écoles préparant
 *                aux fonctions sociales (130). IFSI, IFAS and the social-work
 *                schools — the training the hospital and the département run.
 *   art          Écoles supérieures artistiques et culturelles (312) + Écoles
 *                d'architecture (23) + Écoles de journalisme et écoles
 *                littéraires (48).
 *   autre        Autres écoles de spécialités diverses (1 981). The register's

 *                keeps the register's name rather than being given a flattering
 *                one, because nothing here knows what is in it.
 *
 * The order is load-bearing in one place only: a site whose composantes
 * disagree about their category resolves to the LOWEST index present, so the
 * low end must be the reading that over-claims nothing about the site. A
 * campus that is partly a university IS a university campus.
