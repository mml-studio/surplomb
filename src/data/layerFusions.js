/*
 * LAYER FUSIONS — the one place that says which rows are ONE SUBJECT.
 *
 * `layerTaxonomy.js` answers "what is this dataset, and which group does it
 * belong to". It cannot answer the question this file exists for: "are these
 * two rows the same subject seen twice?" That is a statement ABOUT A PAIR, and
 * a per-layer field can only ever hold half of it.
 *
 * The audit that produced this table counted fourteen subjects drawn by two to
 * four rows each — DVF sold three times, the road measured four ways, three
 * registers of power plants, education split across two ministries. Every one
 * of those splits is an artifact of the order the layers merged in, not a
 * distinction a reader asked for. A panel that lists them separately makes the
 * reader do the join.
 *
 * WHAT A FUSION IS, AND WHAT IT IS NOT
 *
 * A fusion is a PRESENTATION decision: one row in the Data Layers panel, whose
 * toggle carries several registered layers, with one chip per companion so the
 * reader can still take the subject apart. It deletes NOTHING — not a module,
 * not a source, not a share token. Every fused layer keeps:
 *
 *   - its own id, module, lifecycle and cache;
 *   - its own share token, so links already sent keep restoring exactly what
 *     they always restored (a companion is enabled by token, with or without
 *     its primary — the row simply reads as partly on);
 *   - its own map legend entry, which `_refreshMapLegend` gathers from
 *     `getAll()` and therefore never went through a row in the first place;
 *   - its own credit line.
 *
 * That is deliberate and it is the whole reason this is a table and not a
 * rewrite: merging two layer MODULES is a data migration with a rollback cost,
 * merging two ROWS is a line in this file. Where a deeper merge is genuinely
 * owed — the 56 power plants held by three registers, the médecins family
 * `amenities-fr` still draws — the note on the entry says so, and the fusion
 * is the first half of that work, not a substitute for it.
 *
 * WHY NOT `showInTogglePanel: false` ON THE COMPANION
 *
 * Because that flag says "you enter this through another surface" — it is what
 * `military-awareness` uses, and it leaves the layer with no control at all in
 * the panel. A companion is not hidden: it is a chip, one click away, showing
 * its own on/off state. The reader who wants Sitadel alone can still have it.
 *
 * EXHAUSTIVENESS IS ENFORCED, NOT DOCUMENTED
 *
 * `validateLayerFusions()` runs at import and cross-checks against
 * REGISTERED_LAYER_IDS: an unknown id, an id claimed twice, a primary that is
 * itself somebody's companion, or a fusion with no companion is a BOOT
 * FAILURE. Same contract, same reason, as the taxonomy next door and the
 * duplicate-token assertion in `layerState.js`.

import { REGISTERED_LAYER_IDS } from './layerState.js';

/**
 * The merged subjects.
 *
 * `primary` is the layer that KEEPS the row: its label, its scope chip, its
 * count and its meta line are what the row shows when nothing is expanded.
 * Choosing it is a product decision, not a size contest — where a fusion mixes
 * a world layer with a French one, the world layer is primary, so the row's
 * scope chip never tells a reader outside France that a row with data for them
 * is French-only.
 *
 * `companions[].chip` is the chip label. It is short on purpose: the chip row
 * is a control strip, not a second list of names. `title` is the tooltip, and
 * it is where the honest hedge goes.
 *
 * `primaryChip` is the same thing for the layer that KEEPS the row, and it
 * exists for the MAP KEY rather than for the panel — the primary has no chip
 * because the row's own toggle is its control. When two or more members of a
 * fusion publish a legend at once, `_refreshMapLegend` prints the row name once
 * and then one sub-block per member, titled by its chip; without this field the
 * primary's sub-block would be titled with the row's own name, which says
 * nothing. Measured on « Trafic routier »: four blocks, and the first was
 * called `Trafic routier` under a heading also called `Trafic routier`.
 *
 * It is OPTIONAL, and only the fusions that can currently split their key
 * carry one. A missing `primaryChip` falls back to the layer's display name,
 * and the renderer drops a sub-title that would only repeat the row's — so a
 * fusion whose primary gains a key later degrades to today's rendering rather
 * than to a wrong name. Add one when that happens.
 *
 * `primaryToggle: true` promotes that same label to a CHIP ON THE STRIP, so the
 * primary can be switched off while the row stays on. It requires
 * `primaryChip`, because a chip with no label is a blank button.
 *
 * IT IS THE EXCEPTION, AND THE RULE ABOVE IS STILL THE RULE. On almost every
 * fusion the primary IS the subject and the companions are variants of it — the
 * row's own toggle is the primary's control, and a chip for it would be a
 * second switch for the same thing sitting next to the first. `primaryToggle`
 * is for the fusions where the members are PEERS: « Infrastructure numérique »
 * carries data centres, submarine cables and radio masts, three different
 * objects that happen to share a shelf, and no one of them is the row. Without
 * the flag the reader could add the other two and never subtract the first —
 * measured on that row, where the 4 351 data centres were unswitchable for as
 * long as the reader wanted to look at antennas.
 *
 * `optIn: true` means the row's toggle does NOT switch that companion on. It
 * is for a companion whose cost is real and whose value is conditional — the
 * reader asks for it by pressing the chip. Every other companion follows the
 * row, which is the point of the row.
 *
 * There are two shapes of "conditional" here and they are worth telling apart.
 * `comparables-fr` is conditional on the READER: an empty dossier draws nothing
 * until somebody builds one. `comptages-fr` is conditional on the CAMERA: it
 * holds Paris and nothing else, so a row toggle pressed anywhere else was
 * paying for a layer that could not draw. What they share is that the row
 * cannot know the answer and the chip can ask.
 *
 * A companion that fills a HOLE in its primary is never `optIn`, whatever its
 * geography: `idfm-network` is on this row precisely because Île-de-France
 * publishes no live vehicle, and making it opt-in would put the capital back to
 * zero on a row that promises transit. Its territory is declared through
 * `layerCoverage.js` instead, which dims a control without unplugging it.
 *
 * `disabled: true` is the third state, and it is NOT a weaker `optIn`. `optIn`
 * says "the reader asks for this with the chip"; `disabled` says THERE IS NO
 * CHIP — the companion is withdrawn from the interface entirely, while staying
 * a registered layer with its module, its share token, its credit line and its
 * tests intact. `fusionCompanionsFor` drops it, so the row shows no chip for it
 * and `fusionToggleGroupFor` never switches it on; `fusedIntoFor` deliberately
 * still returns the primary, which is what keeps the layer OFF the panel
 * instead of promoting it back to a row of its own. The matching half lives in
 * `layerState.js` (`DISABLED_LAYER_IDS`), which is what stops a stored session
 * or an old share link from bringing it back with no control to switch it off.
 *
 * Deleting the entry would do the panel half and nothing else; this flag is the
 * reversible form of the same decision — take it out to give the chip back.
