/**
 * @module idfmFrequencyFeed
 *
 * How often anything actually stops here, by hour of the day — the reading of
 * Île-de-France Mobilités' own pre-folded service offer.
 *
 * ── The hole this fills, stated as a fact about the repo ────────────────────
 * There is no time-of-day dimension anywhere in this codebase. `transit-fr`
 * decodes live GTFS-Realtime vehicle positions from 148 national feeds and
 * consumes ZERO IDFM data, because IDFM publishes no vehicle positions at all
 * — `transitCoverage.js` measured 0 vehicles in Paris intra-muros against 453
 * in Bordeaux. `idfm-network` draws 37 956 stops and 2 121 lines as a static
 * referential: it can say WHAT serves a stop and never HOW MUCH. And four
 * module headers (`gtfsRealtime.js`, `transitSchedule.js`, `panFeeds.js`,
 * `transitFrance.js`) state that the project deliberately refuses to load
 * `stop_times.txt`. That refusal is right and this file does not overturn it:
 * the IDFM archive's `stop_times.txt` is **71 778 363 bytes compressed and
 * 747 381 712 uncompressed over 8 593 005 rows** (read out of the zip's own
 * central directory on 2026-09-01), which is 3.3× the 223 MB figure those
 * headers already cite as too much. There is also NO `frequencies.txt` in the
 * archive — 14 members, and that is not one of them — so frequency cannot be
 * read there, only counted.
 *
 * ── Why this file exists instead: IDFM already did the fold ─────────────────
 * `offre_hebdomadaire_moyenne_hors_vacances` on IDFM's own Opendatasoft portal
 * publishes the average number of *courses* per stop, per line and per
 * one-hour band, for a typical non-holiday week of 2025. Measured 2026-09-01:
 * **1 311 578 records, 22 fields, Licence Ouverte v2.0 (Etalab)**,
 * `data_processed` 2026-08-18T15:54:55+00:00, `access-control-allow-origin: *`,
 * `x-ratelimit-limit: 1000000` per day. It is a strictly better licence than
 * the GTFS archive, which the PAN labels `mobility-licence` (Licence Mobilités,
 * with declaration obligations), and better than the ODbL 1.0 that
 * `idfm-network`'s stops carry.
 *
 * Cross-checked against a second, independently built IDFM dataset —
 * `20251120_offre_simplifiee`, which holds one single real day (Thursday
 * 20/11/2025) — at Bibliothèque François Mitterrand (`id_arret` 21955, Métro
 * 14): the one-day file counts **427** passages against this file's average
 * Thursday of **424.9**, its 08:00 band **35** against **36.4**, and its 22:00
 * band **12** against **12.0**. Two files, three numbers, within 4%.
 *
 * ── The operating day runs 04:00 → 03:59, so bands run 4..27 ────────────────
 * The publisher's own description says so and `min/max(tranche_horaire)`
 * confirms it: **4 and 27**. Band 24 is 00:00–00:59 and band 25 is 01:00–01:59.
 * Validating `0 ≤ band ≤ 23` would silently delete the entire night service,
 * which is the half of the day that actually separates two addresses — and it
 * is where the biggest signal in the file lives. Region-wide on band 25:
 * **15 904** courses on a Monday against **31 585** on a Friday (+98.6%).
 *
 * ── Why the day axis is seven and not three ─────────────────────────────────
 * A three-day fold (weekday/Saturday/Sunday) is the obvious compression and it
 * destroys two real facts. Measured region-wide, band by band:
 *   - band 12 (noon) is **154 214** on a Wednesday against **143 614** on a
 *     Monday, +7.4% — the French school half-day showing up in the bus network;
 *     band 16 runs the other way, 189 838 against 196 720.
 *   - band 25 (01:00) is **31 585** on a Friday against **15 904** on a Monday.
 * Monday, Tuesday and Thursday really are near-identical (3 066 375 /
 * 3 071 759 / 3 077 377 courses, a 0.36% spread), so five columns would carry
 * almost everything — but then the card has to explain which two days are
 * missing, which is a worse trade than 28% of a 95 KB payload.
 *
 * ── Trap 1: grouping by the stop's NAME splits 273 stops in two ─────────────
 * The obvious query groups by `(id_arret, nom_arret, latitude_arret,
 * longitude_arret, tranche_horaire)`. Enumerated over all 17 `code_departement`
 * buckets, that yields **36 781 identity rows for 36 502 stops**: 273 stops
 * publish two spellings of `nom_arret`, and in all 271 pairs where both rows
 * carry a coordinate the two coordinates are byte-identical (**maximum spread
 * 0.0 m**). So the split is never geographic — it is one stop drawn twice at
 * one point, each dot holding part of the service.
 *
 * The worked case is stop **23613** at 48.82957575668455 / 2.3220761112834034:
 * "Alésia - Général Leclerc" carries **98.5** courses on an average Tuesday and
 * "Les Plantes" **65.2**. Grouped by `id_arret` alone the stop is **163.7**.
 * A map built on the first query shows a reader 60% of their bus service.
 *
 * It cannot be fixed inside the query, because Opendatasoft refuses a text
 * aggregate: `max(nom_arret)` returns HTTP 400 `ODSQLError` — *"StatAggregation
 * only supports numeric or date expression"* — while `max(latitude_arret)` is
 * accepted. So the identity query keeps the name, and `projectFrequencyStops`
 * folds the duplicates here, in code that a test can hold to it, keeping the
 * variant that carries the most service and reporting the others as `aliases`.
 *
 * ── Trap 2: 549 stops have no coordinate, and they are not placed ──────────
 * `latitude_arret` is null on **549 of the 36 502 stops (1.50%)**, and those
 * same 549 are exactly the rows with a null `code_departement` and a null
 * `nom_commune` — the file's null-département bucket is its no-coordinate
 * bucket. **473 of them are Train**, 69 Bus, 7 Tramway, and they carry
 * **84 768 of the 3 071 759 average-Tuesday courses (2.76%)** — they punch
 * well above their 1.5% weight because they are rail.
 *
 * They are counted and named, never placed, and the reason is measured rather
 * than assumed. Against the `arrets` referential the layer next door already
 * draws: 5 of the 549 join `arrets.arrid`, **518 join `arrets.zdaid`** — the
 * stop ZONE rather than the stop point, the same distinction the GTFS makes
 * with `IDFM:monomodalStopPlace:` — and 26 join neither. Of those 518,
 * **512 resolve to two or more distinct platform coordinates**. There is no
 * single published point to borrow, and picking one platform of a station
 * would be inventing a coordinate. The count goes on the card instead.
 *
 * ── Trap 3: the band axis cannot be pivoted, so it costs rows ──────────────
 * Opendatasoft's aggregate grammar takes arithmetic but not conditionals:
 * `sum(nb_courses_mardi*tranche_horaire)` is HTTP 200, while
 * `sum(if(tranche_horaire=8,nb_courses_mardi,0))` is HTTP 400
 * `ODSQLSyntaxError` (*"unexpected ("*), as is `case when` (*"unexpected
 * when"*) and `sum(x*(tranche_horaire=8))` (*"unexpected ="*). So a stop's 24
 * bands are 24 ROWS, and with `offset + limit <= 20000` hard-capped under
 * `group_by` one call buys **833 stops of full profile**. Four calls split on
 * the band axis buy four times that, which is where {@link IDFM_FREQ_MAX_STOPS}
 * comes from.
 *
 * ── Why there is no whole-region pack, unlike `sup-fr` ──────────────────────
 * Measured, not estimated. A 4 km box on Châtelet holds 802 stops and folds to
 * **596 709 bytes raw / 95 168 gzipped** (744 B per stop). The whole region is
 * 35 953 placed stops, so the same product for Île-de-France is **26.7 MB raw
 * and about 4.3 MB gzipped** — 6.9× the entire French higher-education
 * register that `supFrance.js` ships whole (0.62 MB gzipped), for one week of
 * one région. It is a viewport product or it is nothing.
 *
 * Dependency-free and side-effect-free (no Cesium, no DOM) so it runs
 * identically in the browser, in the Vite dev-server proxy, and under
 * `node --test`.
