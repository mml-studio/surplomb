/**
 * @module flightRoutePlan
 * @description The scheduled leg of a tracked flight, turned into something
 * drawable and something framable — and nothing else.
 *
 * ── What this is, and what it is not ────────────────────────────────────────
 * The route source (VRS standing data, src/vrsStandingData.js) answers a CALLSIGN with the leg that callsign is scheduled to fly
 * today. It is a timetable entry, not a measurement: no part of it comes from
 * the transponder. The trail behind the aircraft is the flown track; this arc
 * is the plan. Everything here is named `plan` for that reason, and the caller
 * is expected to caption it {@link ROUTE_PLAN_KICKER} — the same words the
 * cockpit already prints over the same data.
 *
 * The plausibility gate lives one level up in `routePlausible.js`, which the
 * flights layer applies before a route ever reaches this module: a wrong-leg
 * answer is rejected, never drawn faintly. What is left for this module is
 * geometry and honesty of framing.
 *
 * ── Why the framing math is here, and why 15° ───────────────────────────────
 * "See its origin and its destination on one view" is a camera height, and the
 * height that satisfies it is set by the field of view, not by the horizon.
 * Everywhere below the clamp, `dMax / tan(15°)` — the height at which the
 * farther endpoint lands 15° off the boresight — is well above the height at
 * which that same endpoint clears the horizon, so one formula covers both. The
 * clamp is 12 000 km, reached at a 3 200 km leg: past there the two airports
 * are far enough around the planet that no camera height brings them into one
 * frame, `routeFitsOneView` says so, and the arc and its two pins are what
 * still tell the operator where the far end went.
 *
 * 15°, not the 30° the frustum could hold, for two measured reasons. Cesium's
 * `fov` is HORIZONTAL on a wide canvas, so the vertical half-angle is only
 * ~20° at a 16:10 aspect — an endpoint aimed at 20° lands exactly on the
 * bottom edge, which is where the first live run put Málaga (y = 996 of 1000).
 * And the globe is not the whole canvas: the legend and the CONTEXT rail take
 * roughly 350 px off each side, so 15° is what keeps both airports inside the
 * band that is actually unobstructed.
 *
 * ── Why the camera stands off the route's FLANK ─────────────────────────────
 * The standoff azimuth is the route bearing plus 90°, so the leg runs ACROSS
 * the screen. That is not a composition preference: with a fixed
 * south-of-target standoff, the two endpoints sit at different depths, the
 * near one foreshortens off the bottom of the frame, and which end that is
 * depends on the aircraft's heading. Perpendicular, both ends are at the same
 * depth and are framed symmetrically whatever direction the flight runs.
