/**
 * @module roadStatusCoverage
 *
 * Where French live road status actually exists, measured — so the layer can
 * name the publisher and the reason instead of drawing an empty map.
 *
 * THE SHAPE OF THE HOLE, AND WHY IT IS THE EXACT COMPLEMENT OF THE OTHER ONE.
 * `transitCoverage.js` records that live transit is dark in Lyon, Marseille,
 * Toulouse and Lille and bright in Bordeaux, Rouen and Rennes. This layer is
 * the reciprocal: Marseille, Toulouse, Lyon and Saint-Étienne are among its
 * best-covered cities, and it is Paris that is black. The two layers together
 * cover most of urban France; neither does alone, and saying so is the point
 * of both of these modules.
 *
 * THREE DIFFERENT KINDS OF NOTHING, kept apart because they are not the same
 * statement and a viewer deserves to know which one they are looking at:
 *
 *   **No publisher.** Île-de-France. The DIRIF operates the densest urban
 *   motorway network in the country and appears in neither publication: zero
 *   counting stations in the national referential, zero agglomeration status
 *   feeds. Verified three ways on 2026-08-31 — the referential has no row
 *   inside the region's bounding box, `TRAFICOLOR-DIR` has no directory for
 *   it, and data.gouv.fr's only DIRIF dataset is a 2008–2011 count archive.
 *
 *   **State published, position withheld.** Lille, and all but two sites of
 *   Nancy–Metz. These centres publish a live colour for hundreds of sites —
 *   357 for Lille alone — under identifiers that appear in no referential row
 *   and are not addresses either. The traffic is measured, it is published,
 *   and nobody says where it is. Drawing nothing there is correct; implying
 *   nothing is happening there is not.
 *
 *   **And one kind of nothing that turned out to be something.** Nantes,
 *   Rennes, Saint-Brieuc and Lorient–Vannes were in that second list until
 *   2026-09-01, on the same evidence: 615 live states under identifiers no
 *   referential row mentions. They were not unlocatable — they were addressed
 *   rather than positioned. `35A0084T096_00D` is département 35, route A84,
 *   PR 96, and every point repère of the national network is published with
 *   its coordinates in the open `Bornage du réseau routier national`. Joining
 *   the two placed 602 of them, and moved four cities from this table's dark
 *   list to its showcase list. DIR Ouest's 115 counting stations came back the
 *   same way, from the PR their own referential rows carry.
 *
 *   **Off the national network.** Everywhere else. This dataset covers the
 *   non-conceded RRN — motorways and trunk roads the State operates directly.
 *   A département road, a city street, and every kilometre of conceded
 *   motorway (Vinci, APRR, Sanef) are all outside it by definition.
 *
 * MAINTENANCE. Every figure here is a measurement with a date on it, and it
 * will age: a DIR that starts publishing coordinates — or a grammar that turns
 * out to be an address after all — moves a city from the second list to the
 * showcase list. `npm run road-status:index` re-measures,
 * and `roadStatusCoverage.test.mjs` checks this table against the built
 * `config/datex_traficolor_sites.json` so a city that has gained geometry
 * fails the build rather than staying wrongly dark.
 *
 * Dependency-free and side-effect-free.

 *
 * `located` is how many of that centre's sites the committed geometry can
 * nonetheless place, and it is checked against the built index exactly. It is
 * not always zero: two of DIR Est's stations publish a point repère where the
 * other seventy do not, so Nancy–Metz is dark in the way a city with two lit
 * windows is dark, and the table says two rather than none.
 *
 * `reason` is a GETTER onto `roadStatusCoverage.i18n.js`, read when a notice
 * is built and not when this module loads; the names and operators beside it
 * are data and stay here.
