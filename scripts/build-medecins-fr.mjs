/**
 * Build the doctors pack — every place in France where a doctor holds a
 * conventioned practice, the best coordinate anyone can derive for it, and the
 * named practitioners at each.
 *
 * WHY THIS SCRIPT EXISTS: **the national register of doctors has no
 * coordinates, and the geocoded copies in circulation are a decade old.**
 *
 * The Caisse nationale de l'Assurance Maladie publishes the *Annuaire santé
 * Ameli* (`annuaire-sante-ameli`, Licence Ouverte 2.0, weekly) — the only
 * nationwide list of doctors practising under convention, published under
 * article L. 1461-2 of the Code de la santé publique. Measured on the
 * 2026-08-17 edition: **555 249 rows, of which 194 114 are doctors**. Its
 * address block is called `coordonnees_*`, and that word is a false friend:
 * `coordonnees_voie`, `coordonnees_code_postal`, `coordonnees_ville`,
 * `coordonnees_num_tel`. It means *contact details*. **There is not one
 * latitude in the file.**
 *
 * The obvious escape is to use one of the ready-geocoded copies — Opendatasoft
 * publishes `medecins` with a real `geo_point_2d`, and a dozen territorial
 * portals (Île-de-France, Aix-Marseille, Orléans, Blois, Gers…) federate it
 * with an Explore API that would have made this script unnecessary. Do not.
 * Every one of them descends from the PREVIOUS CNAM directory, which was
 * deprecated when the Ameli file replaced it in December 2025, and the age
 * shows in its own columns: its convention field still reads *"Secteur 2,
 * Signature du contrat d'accès aux soins"*. The CAS closed to new signatures on
 * 2016-12-31 and was replaced by the OPTAM — which is what the current Ameli
 * file publishes. That copy also holds **128 721 distinct professionals of
 * every profession**, against 187 584 distinct doctor-at-address tuples in the
 * file this script reads. It is not a stale mirror; it is a different decade.
 *
 * The one daily-geocoded national register does exist — Atlasanté's RPPS
 * layer, geocoded through the IGN geoservices — and it answers HTTP 403,
 * *"Accès interdit aux données en consultation"*, to anyone outside the ARS
 * network. So the geocoding has to happen here.
 *
 *   1. **CNAM — Annuaire santé Ameli** (Licence Ouverte 2.0), the PS file. The
 *      spine: name, specialty, practice address, telephone, conventional
 *      sector, tariff option, Sesam-Vitale. Coordinates: none.
 *   2. **CNAM — Annuaire santé Ameli**, the CDS file. 3 601 centres de santé by
 *      FINESS number, of which **2 375 over 2 346 addresses offer a medical
 *      specialty** — 9 086 more entries. Urban general practice the PS file
 *      alone would leave as a hole.
 *   3. **BAN — Base Adresse Nationale** (Licence Ouverte 2.0), through
 *      `api-adresse.data.gouv.fr/search/csv/`. Keyless, batch, no quota to ask
 *      for. It is what turns 1 and 2 into a map.
 *
 * ── The three geocoding passes, and why there are three ─────────────────────
 *
 * Deduplicating doctors down to practice addresses gives 64 625 addresses, and
 * a single BAN pass filtered on the postcode column places 60 702 of them
 * (93.9 %). The 3 923 failures are not bad addresses — they are **CEDEX**.
 * The register stores the CEDEX distribution code where a postcode belongs:
 * `57085 METZ CEDEX 03` is a mail-sorting identity, not a place, and BAN
 * rightly knows no such postcode. So:
 *
 *   pass 1  voie + ville, FILTERED on code_postal. Strictest, 93.9 %.
 *   pass 2  the failures again, CEDEX and CS/BP/TSA stripped, postcode filter
 *           DROPPED — matching on text alone. Recovers 2 982.
 *   pass 3  what is still missing, ville alone, accepting a commune centre.
 *           Recovers 547 more, and they are marked as commune-level.
 *
 * Passes 2 and 3 drop the postcode filter, so they can match a same-named
 * commune four departments away. Every result from them is therefore checked
 * against the department of the original postcode and DISCARDED on mismatch —
 * 512 in pass 2, 382 in pass 3. Placing a Metz practice in the Var would be
 * worse than not placing it, so 394 addresses end this script unplaced, are
 * counted in `stats.passes.unplaced`, listed by name in `nonLocalisees`, and
 * are not drawn anywhere.
 *
 * ── What the precision means ────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * BAN says what it matched, and this file keeps that word rather than flatten
 * it: `numero` (53 442 addresses, 82.7 %, the exact door), `voie` (9 390,
 * 14.5 %, the street), `lieu-dit` (683), `commune` (716 — the town centre,
 * which is not a surgery). A consumer that draws all four the same way is
 * claiming a precision the source never gave. Same rule the schools layer
 * settled on, for the same reason.
 *
 * ── What this file cannot tell you ──────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * **The register carries no identifier.** No RPPS, no ADELI, no SIRET — just a
 * name, a specialty and an address. So "how many doctors are there" is NOT
 * answerable from it: a doctor practising on two sites is two rows, and two
 * namesakes at one address are indistinguishable from one doctor listed twice.
 * Everything this script counts is counted in tuples of (name, first name,
 * address), and `stats` says so in those words. Do not let a consumer print
 * "187 584 doctors" — the honest sentence is "187 584 distinct
 * practitioner-at-address entries".
 *
 * It is also **conventioned liberal practice only**. A hospital salaried
 * doctor is not in it, which is why the map thins out around a CHU rather than
 * over it. The exhaustive register of everyone authorised to practise is the
 * ANS's RPPS extraction — 817 MB, daily, and with no coordinates either.
 *
 * ── Is it right? The CNAM's own headcount says yes ──────────────────────────
 *
 * The same publisher counts the same population a second way, in
 * `demographie-exercices-liberaux` on data.ameli.fr — liberal exclusive plus
 * mixed, millésime 2024 — and that is the control `--verifier` runs against.
 * Measured 2026-09-01: **117 922 named doctors here against 112 159 there,
 * +5.1 %**, across 23 matched professions running −1.5 % to +15.1 % with the
 * bulk between +2 and +6 %. Per DEPARTMENT — the number that decides whether a
 * map is honest — the median gap is **+2.1 %, with 97 of 101 departments inside
 * [-10 %, +15 %]**, so the geocoding has not moved population between
 * departments. A directory sitting a few percent above an activity count taken
 * two years earlier is the expected answer, not a defect.
 *
 * ── Two outputs, and why the names are not in the map file ──────────────────
 *
 *   medecins.json     sites, specialties, the department rollup, the APL.
 *   praticiens.jsonl  the named practitioners, ONE LINE PER SITE, in the same
 *                     order as `sites[]`.
 *
 * Inlining the names cost 4.9 MB on a 7.3 MB file, downloaded in full to draw
 * dots that never show a name. Line N ↔ `sites[N]` means a byte-offset index
 * stays trivial the day the card is served by a proxy.
 *
 * ── Where they go, and why the names never go into the repository ──────────
 *
 * By default both land in `.gev-cache/medecins-fr/pack/` (`GEV_MEDECINS_PACK_DIR`),
 * the deployment's own cache volume, where the proxy prefers them to the
 * repository's copy. The hosted box rebuilds them weekly (docs/DEPLOY.md), so
 * a correction made at Ameli reaches the map within a week, and the names
 * are filtered through the same suppression list the proxy applies
 * (`GEV_MEDECINS_SUPPRESS`) — a list that exists and cannot be read stops
 * the build. See `src/data/medecinsNames.js` for why.
 *
 * `--repo` refreshes the repository's name-free `medecins.json.gz` instead,
 * and writes no names file at all: the pack it writes declares
 * `praticiens: null`, so nothing lying beside it is ever paired with it.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   npm run medecins:registry                    # the pair, into the cache volume
 *   npm run medecins:registry -- --repo          # the name-free pack, into src/
 *   npm run medecins:registry -- --report        # full precision + coverage audit
 *   npm run medecins:registry -- --refresh       # re-download, ignore the cache
 *   npm run medecins:registry -- --no-cds        # PS file only, skip centres de santé
 *   npm run medecins:registry -- --no-apl        # skip the DREES accessibility indicator
 *   npm run medecins:registry -- --praticiens    # also write the per-doctor CSV to the cache
 *   npm run medecins:registry -- --verifier      # cross-check against the CNAM's own headcount
 *   npm run medecins:registry -- --plain         # write the two outputs uncompressed

 * The hospitals, read out of FINESS.
 *
 * ── WHY THEY ARE HERE AND NOT NEXT DOOR ────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * They were a family of « Équipements du quotidien » until 2026-09-15, drawn
 * from this same register by the amenity pack. A hospital is not an everyday
 * errand: a reader looking for one is asking a health question, and every other
 * answer to that question — 64 232 practice addresses, the DREES accessibility
 * indicator, 186 118 defibrillators — is already on this row.
 *
 * ── WHAT THE MOVE COST, MEASURED BEFORE IT WAS MADE ────────────────────────
 *
 * 1 113 of the 2 211 hospitals have a liberal practice address within 50 m, and
 * the MEDIAN of those distances is **0 m** — the same coordinate, because a
 * consultant's registered address is the hospital they consult in. Drawn
 * naively that is 1 113 plates stacked exactly on 1 113 other plates.
 *
 * So the pack publishes `praticiensSurPlace` per hospital: the practice rows
 * within {@link HOSPITAL_MERGE_M} are counted here, at build time, and
 * `medecinsFrance.js` draws ONE mark for the pair — the hospital's, because the
 * institution is the larger fact — with the practitioner count on its card. The
 * join is done once, offline, against the addresses this script has already
 * geocoded, rather than 2 211 times per viewport in the browser.
 *
 * ── WHAT IS NOT TAKEN ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Pharmacies. FINESS publishes 19 216 of them in the same file and they stay in
 * « Équipements du quotidien », where they belong: you go to a pharmacy the way
 * you go to a bakery. The cross-check that settled it ran on 2026-09-15 — only
 * 27.1 % of pharmacies have a practice within 50 m against 50.3 % of hospitals,
 * which is the difference between a shop on a high street and a department of a
 * medical campus.
