 *
 * The national regime: 96 painted départements, and the one number this layer
 * is allowed to paint them with.
 *
 * ── Why the choropleth is a SHARE and not a count ───────────────────────────
 * `schools-fr`, `sup-fr` and `irve-fr` all paint counts, and for those three it
 * is the right choice. It is the wrong one here, and the measurement says so:
 * the raw count of everyday amenities per département runs from 186 (Territoire
 * de Belfort) and 221 (Lozère) to 3 560 (Nord) and 3 710 (Paris), and that
 * ordering is, to three significant figures, the ordering of the population. A map of where the pharmacies are is
 * a map of where the people are, and drawing it teaches a reader nothing they
 * did not already know about France.
 *
 * The question this layer actually exists to answer is *how far do you have to
 * go*, and there is a population-free way to ask it out of the same file. BPE
 * lists **34 915 distinct DEPCOM codes** — the commune, and for Paris, Lyon and
 * Marseille the municipal arrondissement — of which **34 778 fold onto a
 * metropolitan polygon**. So: in how many of a département's communes is there
 * at least one of the five families the BPE carries?
 *
 * Nationally the answer is **15 196 of 34 778 = 43.7%**, and it discriminates
 * where the count did not: Gers 21.6%, Hautes-Pyrénées 22.0%, Somme 22.5%,
 * Ardennes and Meuse 22.6% at the bottom; Paris, Hauts-de-Seine,
 * Seine-Saint-Denis and Val-de-Marne at 100%; median 48.8%. Two thirds of
 * French communes contain no doctor, no shop, no post office, no pool and no
 * gendarmerie, and that is the fact worth painting.
 *
 * ── What the share deliberately leaves out, and why ─────────────────────────
 * The two FINESS families — 19 216 pharmacies and 2 211 hospitals — are NOT in
 * the numerator, and the card says so. FINESS publishes `ligneacheminement`, a
 * postal routing line ("01440 VIRIAT"), and no INSEE commune code; a postal
 * code is not a commune code and pretending otherwise would mis-assign
 * thousands of rows. They are counted per département by point-in-polygon like
 * everything else and they appear in every card and in both point regimes —
 * they are simply not in the coverage ratio, because the denominator they would
 * need does not exist in their file.
 *
 * ── Nothing is joined on a département code ────────────────────────────────
 * Three vocabularies describe the same territories in the two registers alone:
 * BPE writes `971 972 973 974 976` and Corsica as `2A`/`2B`; FINESS writes
 * `9A 9B 9C 9D 9F`, plus `9E` for Saint-Pierre-et-Miquelon and `9J` for
 * Wallis-et-Futuna; the bundled IGN outlines use a third. So every point and
 * every commune here is placed by point-in-polygon against the drawn shapes,
 * with the shared 2 km coastal snap for the ones the simplified outlines leave
 * in the sea, exactly as `franceDepartements.js` prescribes.
 *
 * ── What the choropleth cannot show ────────────────────────────────────────
 * The bundled polygons are metropolitan: 96 features, no overseas geometry. So
 * **2 681 of the 95 406 dots** — Guadeloupe, Martinique, Guyane, La Réunion,
 * Mayotte, Saint-Pierre-et-Miquelon and Wallis-et-Futuna — cannot be painted,
 * and the card reports them rather than letting the choropleth imply France has
 * 92 725 everyday amenities. 307 more were two kilometres or less out to sea and
 * were snapped to the coast they belong to, which is the shared rule rather than
 * a new one. They are present in both point regimes, which draw
 * positions and not polygons.
 *
 * Dependency-free and side-effect-free (no Cesium, no DOM) so it runs
 * identically in the browser, in the Vite dev-server proxy, and under
 * `node --test`.
