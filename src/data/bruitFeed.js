 *
 * France's aircraft-noise exposure plans, read one screen pixel at a time —
 * and the arithmetic that keeps a number people care about from being a lie.
 *
 * ── What this adds over `urbanismeGpu` ──────────────────────────────────────
 * The Géoportail de l'urbanisme already reaches the *plan d'exposition au
 * bruit*: it is servitude type `t5`/`t7` and `DATA_SOURCES.md` says so. But it
 * arrives there as ONE MORE EASEMENT AT AN ADDRESS — a `suptype` code, an
 * `assiette` outline, a link to a PDF. No zone letter, no threshold, no index,
 * no unit. Measured over the same ground, that layer's answer at Roissy is
 * "servitude aéronautique"; this layer's answer is "zone C, Lden 56 → 65
 * dB(A), arrêté du 03/04/2007, LFPG". The difference is the number.
 *
 * ── THE FIELD THAT MIXES TWO UNITS, AND THE FIELD THAT LIES ABOUT ITS DATE ──
 * `indldenext` / `indldenint` are the two thresholds bounding a PEB band. They
 * are NOT always decibels. France replaced the *indice psophique* with Lden in
 * 2002, and the register keeps both eras in the same two columns with nothing
 * to tell them apart. Measured over ALL 224 airports in the arrêté index on
 * 2026-09-02, one probe each at the scale {@link BRUIT_PROBE_PIXEL_DEG} pins,
 * {@link BRUIT_PROBE_FEATURE_COUNT} features max — 298 PEB zone rows returned
 * (plus 11 PGS rows, all Lden):
 *
 *   arrêté before 2002    75 rows, values 78 … 96   (indice psophique)
 *   arrêté 2002 or later 223 rows, values 50 … 70   (Lden dB(A))
 *
 * THE PROBE SCALE DECIDES THAT CENSUS, which is why it is restated with the
 * scale it was taken at. The same sweep at the pre-pinning 3e-4°/pixel returns
 * 426 rows over the same 224 airports: a coarser probe means a wider
 * GetFeatureInfo buffer, so it catches polygons the point is not in. Those extra
 * rows are all `atPoint: false` — verified on the six airports that gain an
 * answer between the two scales — so they are context, never answers.
 *
 * Printing "84–89 dB(A)" over Semur or Villacoublay is a fabricated physical
 * unit. So the unit is chosen from the DATE, never from the value.
 *
 * AND THE DATE FIELD IS NOT ENOUGH ON ITS OWN. `date_arret` is stale on at
 * least one airport: **LFNA (Gap-Tallard) publishes `date_arret`
 * 1985-07-01 with `ref_doc` `PEB_LFNA_11_04_2017.pdf` and the values 70/70** —
 * the plan was reissued in 2017 in Lden and the date column was never moved.
 * Reading `date_arret` alone labels Gap "indice psophique 70", which is an
 * obsolete unit printed on a live decibel value. So the effective year is the
 * LATER of `date_arret` and the date inside the document `ref_doc` points at
 * (see {@link arreteDocumentDate}); measured, 6 of the 298 rows carry a
 * document newer than their register date and exactly 1 of them — Gap — has the
 * two dates straddling 2002, so exactly 1 row changes unit.
 *
 * THE VERDICT IS THEN CHECKED, NOT TRUSTED. An Lden verdict must not carry a
 * value above {@link BRUIT_LDEN_MAX_OBSERVED}, and a psophique verdict must not
 * carry one below {@link BRUIT_PSOPHIQUE_MIN_OBSERVED}. Measured over the same
 * 298 rows the two scales do not overlap at all — nothing lands in 70 < x < 78
 * — and the effective-date rule disagrees with the value range on **0 rows**.
 * A future disagreement is reported as `indexDisputed` and the unit is
 * SUPPRESSED rather than guessed: no unit at all beats the wrong one.
 *
 * Nothing here converts psophique to dB. The correspondence is a regulatory
 * table, not a formula, and it is not in this data.
 *
 * ── THE SERVER STOPS ANSWERING WHEN YOU ZOOM IN, WITH HTTP 200 ──────────────
 * `dgac_peb_plan_wmsv` carries a MinScaleDenominator. Measured at Roissy on
 * 2026-09-01, same point, only the requested rendering scale changed:
 *
 *   1:119,271  → 1 feature, 3,932 B      1:39,757 → 1 feature,  7,803 B
 *   1: 26,505  → 1 feature, 9,660 B      1:24,848 → **0 features, 137 B**
 *   1: 23,387 / 1:22,718 / 1:22,087 / 1:20,925 → 0 features, 137 B each
 *
 * The cutoff sits between 1:26,505 and 1:24,848, i.e. on 1:25,000. Below it the
 * service answers HTTP 200 with an empty FeatureCollection, which reads exactly
 * like "there is no noise plan here". Its sibling `dgac_pgs_plan_wmsv` has no
 * such floor — measured down to 1:994 at Orly, still answering. So the probe
 * geometry is PINNED at {@link BRUIT_PROBE_PIXEL_DEG} per pixel (1:39,757, a
 * 59% margin over the measured floor) and never derived from the camera.
 *
 * That pinning also buys detail: the returned outline is generalised to the
 * requested scale. Same Roissy zone C, 2,106 B at 1:312,968 and 9,660 B at
 * 1:26,505 — a 4.6× difference in vertices for one polygon. Nothing drawn here
 * is a surveyed boundary and the card says so.
 *
 * ── GetFeatureInfo ANSWERS "NEAR", NOT "UNDER" ──────────────────────────────
 * GeoServer returns features within a buffer of the queried pixel, so a
 * returned zone is not necessarily a zone the point is IN. Measured at Les
 * Mureaux (LFXU) at the pinned scale: 4 features come back and only 2 of them
 * contain the probe point — the two zone-A polygons are beside it, not under
 * it. So every feature is re-tested here with `pointInPolygons` from
 * `ringGeometry.js`, holes included, and only `atPoint` zones answer the
 * question. The rest are kept and drawn as context rather than discarded,
 * because "the louder zone starts thirty metres away" is worth seeing.
 *
 * ── ONE ANSWER PER AIRPORT, AND THE INNERMOST ZONE WINS ─────────────────────
 * A probe can return several bands of one plan at once, and can return two
 * different airports' plans at one point (measured at Le Bourget: LFPB zone A,
 * arrêté 2017, AND Roissy's zone D, arrêté 2007, both containing the point).
 * Two plans are two facts, so they are reported separately, each with its own
 * arrêté and its own unit. Within ONE airport the bands are ordered by
 * severity — A over B over C over D — and the most exposed is the airport's
 * answer; the others are the bands that contain it and are listed, never
 * dropped. Identical bands published as separate polygons (measured at LFXU,
 * LFPV, LFPZ and LFGQ) are merged, and the piece count reported.
 *
 * Dependency-free apart from `ringGeometry.js`, and side-effect-free (no
 * Cesium, no DOM) so it runs identically in the browser, in the Vite
 * dev-server proxy, and under `node --test`.

/**
 * Degrees per pixel for an OVERVIEW probe — the scale at which ONE probe

 *
 * THE PINNED SCALE ABOVE ANSWERS THE WRONG QUESTION FROM A DEZOOMED CAMERA,
 * and the reason is the same buffer that made `atPoint` necessary. A PEB is a
 * set of NESTED RINGS: the reference point sits inside zone A, and zones B, C
 * and D are donuts that do not contain it. GetFeatureInfo returns what is
 * within a few pixels of the queried one, so at 1e-4°/pixel — 11 m of ground
 * per pixel — the buffer reaches about thirty metres and only zone A comes
 * back. Fly up and the answer does not get wider; it stays one band while the
 * three that surround it, the ones a reader zoomed out to see, are never asked
 * for.
 *
 * Measured 2026-09-02, one probe at each aerodrome's own published point,
 * counting DISTINCT bands (`code_oaci` + `zone`) returned, over the same
 * 25-aerodrome sample of the register:
 *
 *   1e-4°/px  1:39,757     37 bands   (the pinned scale — the band underfoot)
 *   1e-3°/px  1:397,570    79 bands   1,569 vertices
 *   3e-3°/px  1:1,192,709  88 bands   1,284 vertices
 *   5e-3°/px  1:1,987,848  88 bands   1,055 vertices
 *   1e-2°/px  1:3,975,696  88 bands     883 vertices
 *
 * 88 is the whole sample's plans, and 3e-3 already reaches it — SO WHY 1e-2.
 * Because the sample does not contain the two aerodromes the register itself
 * makes hardest, and they were probed separately:
 *
 *   · **LFPG (Roissy)** answers A, B, C at 3e-3, 5e-3 and 7e-3, and only picks
 *     up **zone D at 1e-2**. Its zone D is the national outlier — 65.8 km
 *     across — so its inner boundary is further from the reference point than
 *     any other in France, and it is exactly the ring a dezoomed view is for.
 *   · **LFPN (Toussus)** answers zone C alone at 3e-3 and gains **zone B at
 *     5e-3**. It is one of the three aerodromes the module header records as
 *     answering NOTHING at the pinned scale; at overview scale all three —
 *     LFPN, LFPK, LFPT — answer.
 *
 * The price is generalisation, and it is paid knowingly: 883 vertices against
 * 1,284 at 3e-3, about 30% fewer, for outlines drawn at 1:3,975,696. That is
 * what the service generalises to at this scale and it is the right amount of
 * detail for a shape being read from a hundred kilometres up — but it is NOT a
 * finer answer than the pinned probe, it is a wider one, and the card says
 * which scale it is looking at rather than letting the two be confused.
 *
 * Going coarser buys nothing and costs bands: at 3e-2 the sample still returns
 * 88 of its own bands plus its neighbours' (which the overview fetches anyway,
 * one probe per aerodrome), and LFEL LOSES one — 4 bands at 1e-2, 3 at 3e-2.
