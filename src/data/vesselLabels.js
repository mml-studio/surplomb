/**
 * @module vesselLabels
 * @description Shared AIS semiology: the type→hue table, the world-overlay card
 * policy, and — since the size pass — the HULL, which is the one quantitative
 * channel this layer was throwing away.
 *
 * ── What this module now owns, and why it is here ───────────────────────────
 *
 * `aisLiveVessels.js` draws the chevrons and `aisStreamAdapter.js` decodes the
 * socket; both need the same answer to "how big is this ship, and did anyone
 * actually say?". Putting that answer in one pure module (no Cesium, no I/O)
 * is what keeps the transponder's sentinel values from being interpreted twice
 * in two slightly different ways — which is exactly how the default CARGO hue
 * survived for so long.
 *
 * ── The measurement that decides everything ─────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Two independent runs on the live AISStream feed, world bounding box,
 * 2026-09-03 (5 min, then 4 min):
 *
 *   · 18 308 then 15 982 distinct MMSIs carried a position;
 *   · 18.0 % then **16.2 %** published a usable hull. Restricted to the French
 *     bounding box — the product's actual view — 666 of 3 756 contacts, 17.7 %;
 *   · 1 709 of 4 307 dimension blocks were ALL ZEROS: the "not available"
 *     default of an unconfigured transponder, and the commonest shape on the
 *     wire. 4 more carried a beam wider than the hull was long (a transposed
 *     field). None was saturated at 511/63, and none was under 3 m.
 *
 * So **four contacts in five publish no hull**, and any design that gives them
 * a default size would be inventing the size of 82 % of the map. That is the
 * aircraft defect this repo has just finished correcting ("97 % de la flotte
 * visible portait une silhouette inventée", cartography plan § 1.4, #78),
 * and it is not worth repeating at sea.
 *
 * Length distribution over the measured hulls (m):
 * min 4 · p05 12 · p10 15 · p25 22 · **median 40** · p75 105 · p90 183 ·
 * p95 229 · p99 332 · max 400. Beam: median 10 · p90 30 · max 80.
 * The median contact is a 40 m workboat, not a container ship — which is why
 * the ramp is anchored at 200 m rather than at the maximum, and why the floor
 * is set at the measured p10 (16 m, where 12.2 % of hulls sit) instead of at
 * zero.

 * ── What is in the data ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Message 5 (`ShipStaticData`) and message 24 part B (`StaticDataReport`)
 * publish four integers referenced to the transponder antenna, not to the
 * hull's centre: A = to bow, B = to stern, C = to port, D = to starboard
 * (ITU-R M.1371-5, table 51). Length overall is A + B and beam is C + D. The
 * repo threw all four away: `vite.config.js:17281` kept only name, type,
 * destination and IMO from exactly the message that carries them.
 *
 * ── The three sentinel values, which are NOT measurements ───────────────────
 *
 * Every field defaults to 0 for "not available", and that default reaches the
 * wire constantly — a Class B transponder that has never been configured
 * broadcasts 0/0/0/0 forever. A + B = 0 is therefore the single most common
 * "dimension" on the feed and it must never become a hull.
 *
 * A and B saturate at 511 ("511 m or greater"), C and D at 63. The largest
 * ship ever built was 458 m (Seawise Giant, scrapped 2010); the widest hull
 * afloat is 124 m (Pioneering Spirit) and it is a twin-hull outlier. So a
 * reported 511 is the transponder saying "off my scale", not a measurement,
 * and it is refused. {@link VESSEL_LOA_MAX_M} / {@link VESSEL_BEAM_MAX_M} are
 * the plausibility ceilings above which the quadruple is discarded whole: a
 * transposed or mis-scaled field is far more likely than a record-breaking
 * hull, and a 4 km chevron in a harbour is a worse error than a missing one.
 *
 * Length and beam are resolved SEPARATELY on purpose. A + B > 0 with
 * C + D = 0 is a real and frequent shape (length configured, beam left at the
 * default): the arrow's area may carry the length, and no hull may be drawn,
 * because a hull needs a width and inventing one is exactly rule A1.

 * boat only reaches 10 px at 2.3 km. There is no single altitude at which every
 * hull becomes legible, which is why the chevron never leaves.

 * The hull outline in the local tangent plane, metres east and north.
 *
 * Five vertices — a rectangle with a pointed bow — laid out in the SHIP frame
 * (x to starboard, y to bow) about the AIS reference point, which is the
 * antenna and not the centre of the hull. That is why `toBowM` and `toPortM`
 * are carried through {@link vesselHullFromAisDimensions} rather than being
 * reduced to a length and a beam: recentring the polygon on the position fix
 * would move a 400 m ship by up to 200 m, which at the altitude where hulls
 * draw is a visible lie about where the bow is.
 *
 * When the antenna offsets are absent the outline is centred, and the caller is
 * expected to have refused the hull already — this function does not invent.
 *
 * The polygon is then rotated by the vessel's heading, clockwise from north, in
 * the tangent plane. Heading is NOT defaulted: a hull is a directional object
 * and an undirected one drawn pointing north is a fabricated orientation, so
 * the caller filters on a published heading before calling.
 * @param {{loaM: number, beamM: number, toBowM?: number|null, toPortM?: number|null}} hull
 * @param {number} headingDeg Direction of travel, degrees clockwise from north.
 * @returns {Array<[number, number]>|null} `[east, north]` offsets (m), or null.
