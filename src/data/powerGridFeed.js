/**
 * @module powerGridFeed
 *
 * Pure OpenStreetMap → power-grid projection for the **Power Grid** layer
 * (`/api/power-grid` proxy in `vite.config.js`, drawing in `powerGrid.js`).
 *
 * What this dataset IS: the transmission network as volunteers have mapped it —
 * high-voltage line routes (`power=line`), their underground counterparts
 * (`power=cable`), the substations they land in (`power=substation`), and the
 * pylons that hold them up (`power=tower` / `power=portal`). © OpenStreetMap
 * contributors under ODbL 1.0, loaded for the VIEWPORT the operator is looking
 * at, never as a country-wide download.
 *
 * What it is NOT: a grid register. OSM power coverage is very good in western
 * Europe and patchy elsewhere; a line that is not drawn here is not a line that
 * does not exist. Nothing in this module ever invents a feature, a voltage, or
 * a vertex.
 *
 * ── The line this module will not cross ─────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A conductor hangs tens of metres above the ground and OSM does not say how
 * high, so this projection publishes the mapped GROUND ROUTE and the layer
 * clamps it to the terrain. Drawing a catenary would mean inventing the one
 * number the data withholds. The same rule kills every other temptation here:
 * a stroke is exactly the mapped way, decimated by nothing, rounded to five
 * decimals (~1.1 m) and no further.
 *
 * ── Six upstream traps, absorbed here and pinned in powerGridFeed.test.mjs ───
 *
 * 1. **A shared element cap starves whatever sorts last.** Overpass emits
 *    node → way → relation, so ONE capped union let 899 towers erase every line
 *    and substation in a Paris viewport (measured 2026-08-27, cap 900, zero
 *    ways returned). Every class gets its OWN output set and its own cap, and
 *    substations get one per element type — the real substation yards are ways
 *    and relations, and 197 street-corner nodes ate a 200-element substation
 *    cap before a single yard came back.
 *
 * 2. **`voltage` is a `;`-separated list carrying junk.** Real values from that
 *    same box: `225000;63000`, `400000;225000;90000`, `225000;225000;225000;63000`,
 *    and `225000;0` — a zero token for a circuit that is not energised.
 *    `Number('225000;63000')` is NaN, which would drop a 225 kV line out of the
 *    grid entirely. Tokens are parsed individually; the maximum positive one
 *    classifies the feature and the whole string travels to the card.
 *
 * 3. **`power=line` does not mean high voltage.** One way in that box is
 *    `power=line` at `voltage=400` — four hundred VOLTS. The Overpass prefilter
 *    regex is only a bandwidth optimisation; the 50 kV floor is enforced
 *    numerically here, so a mirror that ignores the regex cannot put a garden
 *    supply cable on the transmission layer.
 *
 * 4. **`substation=industrial` is a real poste source.** "Poste électrique de
 *    Villeras", operator RTE, `ref:FR:RTE=VLERA`, 225 kV, is tagged
 *    `substation=industrial`; so is a 63 kV RTE yard at Palaiseau. Filtering on
 *    `substation=transmission|distribution` would have thrown both away. The
 *    subtype is carried as a LABEL and never used as a filter — voltage is the
 *    filter, because voltage is the evidence.
 *
 * 5. **A relation substation has no `lat`/`lon`.** Multipolygon yards (Poste
 *    électrique de Haute-Borne, 225 kV) carry only Overpass's computed
 *    `center`; reading `element.lat` gives undefined and the yard vanishes.
 *
 * 6. **`power=cable` is the same network underground.** Same operators, same
 *    voltages, 550 of them against 1,650 overhead ways in one Île-de-France
 *    box. Drawing them identically would claim pylons that are not there, so
 *    `location` decides and the layer dashes them.
 *
 * Dependency-free and side-effect-free so the projection is unit-testable
 * without a Vite server — the same shape as `gasFranceFeed.js` and
 * `osmCameras.js`.

/**
 * Where to draw a pylon, walking the MAPPED VERTICES of the overhead routes.
 *
 * ── WHY THE VERTICES AND NOT A SPACING ALONG THE LINE ───────────────────────
 *
 * A pylon drawn every 2 km by dividing a line into 2 km pieces is a pylon at a
 * position nobody surveyed — the layer's whole discipline is that a mark sits
 * where the data put it. It does not have to be invented here, because of how
 * OpenStreetMap maps a transmission line: the way's node list IS the pylon
 * list.
 *
 * Measured 2026-09-14 against the live proxy, nodes tagged `power=tower` that
 * fall on a vertex of an overhead way THIS LAYER DRAWS: **574 of 574** in the
 * Bayonne box (0.25°, 377 km of overhead route) and **750 of 775** at Saclay.
 * The 25 misses are not noise and they are not a hole in the rule — each is a
 * pylon belonging to a way the layer excludes on purpose; the one audited is
 * `disused:power=line`, a decommissioned 63 kV liaison whose steel is still
 * standing and still tagged. A tower with no drawn route under it has no
 * rhythm to join.
 *
 * The vertex set is the SUPERSET of the tagged one: one vertex every 265 m
 * against one tagged pylon every 657 m at Bayonne, the remainder being the
 * pylons whose node nobody has tagged yet plus the occasional pure bend.
 *
 * So this walks each overhead way vertex by vertex, keeps a running distance,
 * and emits the NEXT MAPPED VERTEX once `spacingM` has gone by. Every mark is a
 * node someone drew. The spacing is honoured as a floor, never as a position:
 * on a route whose vertices are 800 m apart, a 300 m request yields every
 * vertex and not a single interpolation.
 *
 * UNDERGROUND WAYS ARE SKIPPED, and that is not a detail — it is the whole
 * reason the layer dashes them. A cable has no pylons, and it also carries far
 * MORE vertices than an overhead line does (3,173 against 1,426 in that same
 * viewport, because a trench follows streets), so drawing pylons on vertices
 * without this filter would put the densest pylon field exactly where there are
 * none.
