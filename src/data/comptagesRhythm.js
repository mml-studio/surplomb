/**
 * @module comptagesRhythm
 *
 * How a street's DAY is read, coloured and put into words.
 *
 * `comptagesFeed.js` turns 27.7 million rows into 2 977 arcs each carrying four
 * 24-hour profiles. This module is the reading of one of those profiles, and it
 * is separate from both the feed and the renderer because the same three
 * answers have to come out identically on the server, in the card and in the
 * legend: which band an arc is in, when it fills, and when it empties.
 *
 * ── Why a WEEKDAY profile and a WEEKEND one, and not just a mean ────────────
 * Because they are different streets. Measured across the 1 710 arcs that count
 * on both day-types, in the week 2026-08-24 → 2026-08-30:
 *
 *   • The peak hour MOVES at the weekend on **1 434 of them (83.9 %)**.
 *   • The weekday peak is one spike: 18 h on 552 of 1 730 arcs (31.9 %), and
 *     970 arcs peak somewhere in 16–19 h against 407 in 07–09 h. Paris peaks in
 *     the evening on two and a half times as many arcs as in the morning.
 *   • The weekend peak is a plateau instead: 17 h on 305 arcs, 18 h on 301,
 *     19 h on 274, 16 h on 273 — no hour owns the afternoon.
 *   • And **696 of the 1 710 (40.7 %) carry MORE vehicles per hour at the
 *     weekend than on a weekday** (ratio p10 0.847, median 0.980, p90 1.114).
 *
 * A single weekly mean would have hidden every one of those. Two profiles cost
 * 0.15 MB gzipped and are what the layer is for.
 *
 * ── Where Paris empties ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The trough is far more concentrated than the peak: **1 568 of the 1 730
 * counting arcs (90.6 %) are at their quietest between 03 h and 05 h**, 883 of
 * them at 04 h exactly. That is the one hour of the week the city agrees on.
 *
 * ── The colour used to be the COUNT. It is not any more ─────────────────────
 * Until 2026-09-03 the hue AND the stroke width both carried the same number —
 * the arc's mean weekday hour — and the header said so out loud: *"WIDTH
 * repeats the same band, because a hue is not readable in a hairline"*. Two
 * channels, one information, which is the defect rule A3 of `CARTOGRAPHY.md`
 * names. The redundancy also cost the only channel this layer had left, on a
 * pack that holds 2 977 arcs x 168 hours and painted exactly one of them.
 *
 * So the two channels were split:
 *
 *   WIDTH  keeps the count. An absolute quantity belongs on a size channel
 *          (B1), the five bands below are unchanged, and the stroke is baked in
 *          world-space geometry rather than composed with `scaleByDistance`
 *          (B2). What moved is WHICH count: the width now reads the hour the
 *          reader selected, not a single weekly average.
 *   COLOUR takes the SHAPE of the week — a qualitative variable, which is what
 *          hue is for (B4), on seven classes, which is inside B5's ceiling of
 *          five to seven.
 *
 * ── The rhythm classes: what they are, and the counts they hold ─────────────
 * Computed on the 48 published hourly means of each arc (24 weekday, 24
 * weekend), by {@link comptagesRhythmClass}, in a fixed waterfall. Measured on
 * the whole week 2026-08-24 -> 2026-08-30, over the 1 730 counting arcs:
 *
 *   nocturne     56   the 00-04 core carries >= 15 % of the weekday total.
 *                     Bd de Strasbourg, Bd de Clichy - Paris's night streets,
 *                     found by the profile and not by a name list.
 *   week-end    100   the weekend hour averages >= 1.15x the weekday hour.
 *                     Quai de la Rapee, Quai de Bercy, the A6A slip.
 *   pendulaire  367   BOTH commute windows stand >= 1.20x above the midday
 *                     floor. PE Charles Hermite, PE Batignolles.
 *   matinal     150   only the 06-09 window does. PE Lagny, PE Guyane.
 *   vesperal    652   only the 16-19 window does. The largest class by far,
 *                     and that IS the finding: 970 of the 1 730 arcs peak in
 *                     16-19 h against 407 in 07-09 h.
 *   plateau     369   neither window stands out. PE Pont Amont, PI Quai d'Ivry
 *                     - the ring road, saturated from morning to night.
 *   indetermine  36   fewer than 20 of 24 hours published on either day-type.
 *                     19 of them counted on weekdays and never once at the
 *                     weekend. They are NOT given a class they did not earn
 *                     (rule A1); they keep their measured width and lose only
 *                     the hue.
 *
 * The four thresholds are ROUND NUMBERS and they are frozen (rule C1): 15 % of
 * the day at night, +15 % at the weekend, +20 % above the midday floor, 20 of
 * 24 hours of coverage. None of them is a quantile of this week, so an arc does
 * not change class because its neighbours did. For the record, the measured
 * distributions they cut: night share p50 0.082 / p95 0.139 ; weekend ratio p50
 * 0.980 / p90 1.110 ; commute shoulder p50 1.074 / p75 1.201.
 *
 * ── Why these seven hues ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * There is NO GREEN anywhere on the wheel, and that is the whole safety
 * argument: `traffic.js` and `roadStatusFrance.js` both paint a congestion
 * ratio green -> amber -> red, and a traffic-light reading needs the green. An
 * orange arc here cannot be read as "slowing" because nothing on the map is
 * "clear". Beyond that the wheel is a mnemonic of the HOUR rather than an
 * arbitrary set: cold cyan for the morning, deep blue for the night, violet for
 * the two peaks that mix them, orange for the evening, gold for the street that
 * is busy all day, raspberry for the weekend.
 *
 * Separation was measured, not assumed. In CIE L*a*b*, the closest pair of the
 * seven is nocturne/pendulaire at dE 26.1, and every map colour of this layer
 * (the seven, plus occupancy steel, plus the two absence greys) is at least
 * dE 15.8 from every other. Lightness runs L* 41 to 78, so the wheel survives a
 * dark tarmac and a white zebra crossing. The nearest foreign hue is
 * `idfm-network`'s rail blue at dE 18.0 from nocturne; that layer draws
 * pictograms and elevated lines, this one draws ground-clamped strokes, and
 * both publish a legend.
 *
 * ── The hour cursor ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * One average was hiding the pack. Measured over the same week: only 932 of the
 * 1 730 counting arcs (53.9 %) are in the same width band at 18 h as they are
 * on the weekly average, so the single number misfiled 798 streets. Only 124
 * arcs (7.2 %) hold one band across all 48 published slots. From 04 h to 18 h,
 * 1 562 arcs climb at least one band and not one descends.
 *
 * The cursor is a SLOT token — `mean`, `clock`, `w00`..`w23`, `e00`..`e23` —
 * parsed by {@link comptagesParseSlot} and resolved by
 * {@link comptagesResolveSlot}. It navigates an ARCHIVED typical week, never a
 * present: this feed is J-2 and its unit is the last complete Monday-Sunday
 * week, so `clock` means "the hour it is now in Paris, read in that archived
 * week", and every label says which week it read (rule E1). The word "live"
 * still appears nowhere.
 *
 * The bands the cursor moves through, measured (counted arcs, per band, plus
 * the arcs with no published measurement in that slot):
 *
 *   slot     <100  100-250  250-500  500-1k   >=1k   sans mesure
 *   mean      196     620      519     238     157        0
 *   sem 04 h 1174     398       42      74      38        4
 *   sem 08 h  142     503      580     302     199        4
 *   sem 18 h  111     329      628     432     228        2
 *   w-e 04 h  797     529      223      68      93       20
 *   w-e 18 h  110     367      622     381     222       28
 *
 * No empty band at any of them, and the 04 h collapse IS the answer to "a
 * quelle heure". The weekend night is not a quieter version of the weekday
 * night: across the counting network the 00-04 hours carry **1.60x** as many
 * vehicles per hour at the weekend as on a weekday, and 685 arcs climb a band
 * between `w04` and `e04` against 21 that drop one.
 *
 * ── An hour with no measurement is not a quiet hour ─────────────────────────
 * Rule A1 again, one level down. An arc can count all week and still publish
 * nothing in the selected slot: at most 69 of the 1 730 do (weekend 10 h), 51
 * weekday cells and 674 weekend cells out of 41 520 in all. They are NOT drawn
 * at the bottom of the width scale, and they are not drawn like the 891 arcs
 * that never measure anything either. They take a THIRD stroke — a short dash
 * in a pale grey - so the map carries three distinguishable absences: nothing
 * all week (long dash, dark), nothing in this slot (short dash, pale), and a
 * unit the scale does not speak (solid steel, occupancy only).
 *
 * ── The three states, and why a dash ────────────────────────────────────────
 * A third of this network measures nothing, and drawing it as an empty road
 * would be the one lie this layer must not tell. So the primary distinction is
 * not a hue at all, it is the STROKE:
 *
 *   counted    (1 730, 58.1 %)  solid, hue by rhythm class, width by the flow
 *                               band of the SELECTED slot — or a short pale
 *                               dash when that slot published nothing.
 *   occupancy  (356, 12.0 %)    solid, one steel colour, off the ramp. The loop
 *                               reports how much of the hour the road was
 *                               occupied and never a count — that is a real
 *                               measurement in a different unit, and it has no
 *                               position on a veh/h scale.
 *   silent     (891, 29.9 %)    DASHED. 168 hours, no count and no occupancy.
 *                               The gaps in the line are the gaps in the data.
 *
 * And the silence is not uniform. Cross-tabulated against the city's own
 * `etat_barre` over the same 168 hours: **724 of the 891 (81.3 %) are declared
 * `Invalide`** — a sensor the city has already written off — 26 are `Barré`,
 * the road itself being shut, and **141 are declared `Ouvert` and still publish
 * nothing all week**. Only 10 of the 2 086 arcs that DO measure carry an
 * `Invalide`. The card names which of the three it is looking at.
 *
 * ── The occupancy bands are the CITY's, not this layer's ────────────────────
 * `k`'s own field description publishes them: *Fluide = 0 % ≤ K < 15 % ;
 * Pré-saturé = 15 % ≤ K < 30 % ; Saturé = 30 % ≤ K < 50 % ; Bloqué = 50 % ≤ K*.
 * They are reproduced here verbatim rather than invented, and they were
 * verified: over all 500 136 rows of the week, `etat_trafic` matches them with
 * **zero counter-examples** in seven separate probes.
 *
 * No Cesium and no DOM — this runs under `node --test`.
