/**
 * @file TomTom flow drawn as ITSELF — the measurement, not a colour on someone
 * else's geometry.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. The traffic layer animates dots along OSM road polylines
 * (Overpass) and lets TomTom decide only their COLOUR. That made live
 * congestion a passenger: with Overpass slow or down, the flow tiles arrived,
 * decoded, and had nothing to paint on, so the layer sat on "syncing LIVE
 * traffic flow" indefinitely. Measured 2026-09-10 on the hosted origin,
 * `/api/overpass` answered 502 after 25 s while the two TomTom tiles covering
 * the same view fetched and decoded in ~200 ms and carried 3 447 polylines of
 * their own. This module draws those polylines.
 *
 * So the layer now has two independent halves that degrade separately:
 *  - the RIBBON (here) is the measurement, and needs only TomTom;
 *  - the DOTS are the animation, and still need Overpass.
 * Either can be on screen without the other.
 *
 * Rendering is the `roadStatusFrance.js` idiom: ONE batched
 * `GroundPolylinePrimitive`, colour AND width travelling per geometry instance
 * (`GroundPolylineGeometry` bakes its own width, `PolylineColorAppearance`
 * reads a per-instance colour attribute). 3 447 segments is one draw call.
