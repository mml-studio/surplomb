// src/data/rnbPivot.js — the Référentiel National des Bâtiments as the pivot
// of the address lot.
//
// WHAT THIS SOURCE IS. The RNB is the state's building identity register: one
// stable twelve-character identifier per building in France, published with the
// BAN addresses that building answers to, the cadastral parcels it stands on,
// and the identifiers the other registers know it by. It is keyless, CORS-open,
// Licence Ouverte 2.0, and it answers in ~170 ms.
//
// WHY IT MATTERS HERE, AND IT IS NOT ABOUT DRAWING ANYTHING. Every layer in the
// address lot answers a question about a BUILDING and is joined to one by a
// GEOCODED DOT — a DPE, a sale, a permit lands on whichever footprint its
// coordinate happens to fall inside. `buildingTheme.js` says so in its own
// header: the point-in-polygon grid, the smaller-footprint rule, the half-open
// edge. All of that is careful arithmetic on a guess. The RNB replaces the
// guess with a published key, and the BD TOPO tiles this repository already
// draws CARRY THAT KEY: `identifiants_rnb`, slash-separated, on 95.5 % to
// 99.2 % of the footprints measured below.
//
// ── The pivot is calibrated, not trusted ───────────────────────────────────
//
// The RNB names BD TOPO back. Measured 2026-09-07 over the Lyon 2e box
// (4.8200,45.7530 → 4.8320,45.7610), 600 RNB buildings against the four z15
// BD TOPO tiles the layer would load for the same view:
//
//   RNB buildings carrying a `bdtopo` ext_id      574 of 600   (95.7 %)
//   … whose cleabs matches the tile that carries
//     the same RNB id under `identifiants_rnb`    573 of 573  (100.00 %)
//   … RNB id absent from the drawn tiles            1
//
// Zero disagreements. The two registers name each other, which is what makes
// this an identity join and not a heuristic — and it is re-measured by
// `scripts/qa-rnb-pivot.mjs` rather than asserted here, because an edition that
// stopped agreeing has to move a number in a harness before it moves a colour
// on screen.
//
// ── What the pivot buys, measured on the first consumer ────────────────────
//
// The ADEME DPE register publishes `id_rnb` (provenance `Reprise RNB`, or
// `Logiciel` when the diagnostician's software declared it). Joining
// diagnostics to volumes by that identifier instead of by their BAN geocode,
// over four boxes on 2026-09-07 — every diagnostic the box holds, against every
// footprint the layer would draw:
//
//                 footprints   DPE rows   with       joined by    joined by
//                 with RNB     in box     id_rnb     the dot      the id first
//   Paris 13e       95.5 %       2 509     73.7 %     81.8 %        96.3 %
//   Lyon 2e         99.2 %       4 701     60.8 %     40.4 %        75.7 %
//   Marseille       99.2 %       5 000     58.8 %     78.8 %        88.9 %
//   Ustaritz        97.1 %         357     34.5 %     14.0 %        41.5 %
//
// The gain is not marginal and it is not uniform: Lyon nearly doubles because
// its BAN geocodes land in the street, Ustaritz stays low because a rural
// register is thin on both sides. Of the diagnostics the two methods BOTH
// place, they disagree on 2 (Paris), 4 (Lyon), 83 (Marseille) and 4 (Ustaritz)
// — buildings painted with a neighbour's letter today.
//
// ── The three shapes that break a naive index ──────────────────────────────
//
// 1. **One footprint, several RNB ids.** `identifiants_rnb` is a SLASH-joined
//    list: 65 of 2 395 Paris polygons carry 2, 3 or 5. A BD TOPO polygon that
//    merges what the RNB splits must answer to every one of them, so the index
//    maps id → footprints and any of a polygon's ids claims it.
//
// 2. **One RNB id, several footprints.** A building cut across two tiles is
//    drawn twice — `bdtopoBuildingsFeed.js` trap 4 — and both halves carry the
//    same `cleabs` AND the same RNB id: 239 of the 2 062 distinct Paris ids
//    name more than one drawn polygon. A point joined by identity must colour
//    ALL of them, or a building is painted down the middle. It is still ONE
//    matched point, which is why the counter increments once and the bucket is
//    appended to several times.
//
// 3. **An identifier that names nothing on screen.** A diagnostic can carry an
//    RNB id for a building outside the loaded viewport, or one BD TOPO has not
//    picked up: 26 of 1 849 in Paris, 2 of 2 858 in Lyon, 0 elsewhere. That is
//    not a match and not a failure — it is counted separately (`idOffScreen`)
//    and then offered to the geometric join like any other point.
//
// ── What this module does NOT do ───────────────────────────────────────────
//
// It does not fetch in bulk. The identity join needs no network at all: the key
// is already on the tile and already on the register's row. The only call this
// module builds is the ONE lookup a selected building makes to learn its own
// addresses and parcels — `rnbBuildingUrl` — and `bdtopoBuildings.js` makes it
// straight from the browser, with no proxy, for the same reason it reads the
// tiles that way: keyless, CORS-open, one request per click, and a proxy would
// add a cache in front of an answer that changes on the register's cadence and
// not on the operator's.
//
// It also does not yet own the parcel join. `cadastreParcelDetail.js` trap 2
// says "the join is geometric, and nobody publishes it" — the RNB now does,
// through `plots`, and that module is the named next consumer of this one.
//
// And it does NOT bring DVF or the permits along, which is a property of those
// sources and not an omission here. The geolocated DVF file publishes 40
// columns and none of them is an RNB identifier (checked on the 2024 edition of
// 75113): its key to the ground is `id_parcelle`, so a sale reaches a building
// only through `plots`, and there is no bulk endpoint for that — one call per
// parcel, at 50 to 150 parcels per 300 m scan. That makes the DVF pivot a
// per-SELECTION operation like the card below, not a per-viewport theme, and
// wiring it as the latter would trade a wrong colour for a rate limit.
//
// Dependency-free and side-effect-free: no Cesium, no DOM, no fetch.
