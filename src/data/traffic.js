/**
 * @file Street Traffic — animated dots along OSM road polylines, colored by
 * live TomTom congestion when a key is configured.
 *
 * Road geometry: OSM Overpass API (free, no auth). Fetches road polylines for
 * the camera viewport, spawns PointPrimitives that lerp along pre-computed
 * Cartesian3 waypoints. Camera-gated by altitude BAND (see
 * `trafficBounds.ROAD_FETCH_TIERS`): the full street graph in a 5.5 km box up
 * to 8 km, arterials only in a 33 km box up to 30 km, nothing above.
 *
 * Two modes (decided once per session via `/api/tomtom/status`):
 *  - `sim` (keyless default): white dots at hardcoded per-road-class speeds —
 *    the original simulation, byte-identical behavior.
 *  - `live`: TomTom flow tiles (`flowTiles.js`) are matched onto the same
 *    Overpass roads (`flowMatch.js`); matched roads color/slow/densify their
 *    dots by real congestion (`trafficFlowStyle.js`), closed roads spawn no
 *    dots, and unmatched roads keep the simulated white.
 *
 * Architecture overview:
 *  - Camera-change listener triggers debounced road fetching per viewport tile.
 *  - Fetch bounds center on the camera's look-at point (`trafficBounds.js`, C4).
 *  - Roads are fetched in two passes: major-only (fast) then full graph (detailed).
 *  - Fetched tiles are cached by clamped bounding-box key to avoid re-fetching.
 *  - Dot budget allocation distributes a hard cap fairly across visible roads.
 *  - Each dot lerps along pre-computed Cartesian3 waypoints every preRender frame.

 * coordinates every call so nothing could be cached — median of six runs, a

 * That is **~47 ms of fixed cost per BATCH plus ~3.2 ms per call** — the pick
 * frustum switch and the tileset re-traversal are paid once, whatever the
 * batch holds. Two consequences, and they point in opposite directions:
 *
 *   - spreading probes out is the WORST thing that can be done. A time box
 *     that cut the batch to one call was measured on 2026-09-16 taking the
 *     seating loop from 9.8 s to 16.2 s of main thread over the same 40 s.
 *   - no batch, however small, fits in a frame. Even one call is 50 ms.
 *
 * So the lever is not the batch size. It is the NUMBER OF BATCHES, and that is
 * set by {@link floorCellDeg} — how much ground one reading is allowed to
 * answer for.

 *
 * ── Why the cell grid and not the nearest seated road ──────────────────────
 * This used to scan every parsed road for every waiting road. At Paris's
 * 1 991 roads that is ~4 M distance tests a pass, and it was measured at 13 ms
 * for only 561 of them — so ~46 ms once the whole network is waiting, every
 * 250 ms, on top of the probes. The cell grid holds exactly the same readings
 * (every probe is written into it) keyed by ~111 m cell, so the same question
 * is a handful of map lookups. It is also a better answer: a road's own cell
 * beats whichever road happens to have the nearest FIRST VERTEX, which for a
 * long avenue can be a kilometre from the point being asked about.
 *
 * The box gate is kept and moved onto the QUERY. `_roads` still holds the
 * previous view's network while the new one is being parsed, and `_floorCells`
 * is only cleared when the SURFACE changes — so a coordinate outside the
 * current fetch box must not be lent anything, or a Paris height reaches a
 * Biarritz street, the same "one bad reading lent to a whole commune" failure
 * `provisionalFloor.js` measured.

/**
 * Buy surface readings for the roads on screen, a budget at a time, and lend

 *
 * ── Why this is a pass and not a line in `parseRoads` ───────────────────────
 * MEASURED in the running app over Biarritz, camera 900 m at −35°, 2026-09-14:
 * `scene.sampleHeight` answers **−6 311.7 m** for the first ~10 s of a session
 * — the planetary root tile — and **+54.0 m** once the tileset has drained.
 * Roads are parsed the moment their Overpass response lands, which on every
 * camera move is inside that window, and the old code took whatever came back
 * as long as it was finite. The whole network was therefore baked 6 365 m under
 * the street: 1 761 of 1 761 dots out of any plausible band, a median 1 564 px
 * from the road they belong to, worst 4 234 px. With depth testing punched
 * through at 2 km they are painted anyway, so the symptom is not a hole in the
 * map — it is dots sliding across the sky as the camera turns.
 *
 * ── The two tiers ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * TIER 1 — one probe at the fetch-box centre, lent to every road at once. It
 * converts 6 365 m of error into the box's own relief (70 m across this box)
 * for a single call, and it is what a road gets to stand on while it waits.
 *
 * TIER 2 — the road's OWN probe at its first vertex, {@link FLOOR_SAMPLE_BUDGET}
 * per pass, nearest road first so the street under the reader is corrected
 * before the edge of the box. Roads still waiting borrow from the nearest road
 * that has finished rather than from the box centre.
 *
 * Every reading goes through `renderedSurfaceM`, so the drain test, the
 * plausibility band and the 25 km camera ceiling are enforced in one place and
 * a refusal is a refusal — never a latched −6 311 m.
 *
 * @returns {{done:boolean, armed:boolean, probes:number, seated:number,
 *   waiting:number}} What the pass found and what it spent.

 *
 * The FRAME filter is new, and it is what pays for `tierFetchBox`. The fetch
 * box is now the band's full span for everybody — that is what gives the
 * Overpass proxy a key it can answer twice. The box is therefore wider than
 * most windows, and allocating the 6 000-dot budget over everything it
 * returned would spread the same dots over roughly twice the streets:
 * measured at the `qa-traffic-floor` view, 421 roads in frame against 1 003 in
 * the box. Every street on screen drawn half as busy, to buy a cache hit.
 *
 * Filtering here instead closes that, and closes it for all four callers at
 * once — the render pass, both heat-line rebuilds and the ground-seating loop.
 * The seating one is the one that was not obvious: a road out of frame was
 * being bought a `sampleHeight` probe, at 3.2 ms a call on top of a 47 ms
 * batch, to seat dots nobody can see.
 *
 * With no frame recorded the filter is skipped entirely, which is the exact
 * pre-`tierFetchBox` behaviour — that is the path the unit tests and the
 * direct `loadRoadsForBounds` callers take.
