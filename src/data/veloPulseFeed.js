/**
 * Pouls vélo — reading a typical week, and refusing to compare two instruments
 * that do not measure the same thing.
 *
 * WHAT THE PACK CONTAINS. 168 numbers per site: one per hour of a typical week,
 * Monday 00:00 first, averaged over four weeks of June 2026. Two cities, two
 * instruments, and the asymmetry is not an accident of engineering — it is the
 * finding:
 *
 *   · **Lyon publishes an archive of Vélo'v dock availability** running
 *     continuously since 2023-03-27, filterable per station and per date. It is
 *     the only one of its kind in France.
 *   · **Paris publishes no equivalent for Vélib' at all.** Verified 2026-09-02
 *     against opendata.paris.fr (two datasets, both real-time), data.gouv.fr,
 *     transport.data.gouv.fr (the `history` array for the Vélib' dataset is
 *     empty) and the community archive everyone cites,
 *     `lovasoa/historique-velib-opendata`, last pushed 2023-04-04 with release
 *     assets dated 2021.
 *
 * So Paris is shown through its 111 permanent counters instead. Lyon measures
 * STOCKS — how full a dock is — and Paris measures FLOWS — how many cyclists go
 * past. Those are different quantities in different units and this module never
 * puts them on one scale.
 *
 * WHAT IS COMPARABLE, AND IT IS ONLY ONE THING: each site against ITSELF. The
 * colour ramp is the share of that site's own weekly maximum, so "this is a busy
 * hour here" reads the same in both cities while the absolute number keeps its
 * own unit on the card and in the blob's AREA. Two sites in two cities are never
 * on screen together — they are 390 km apart — so a shared absolute scale would
 * buy nothing and cost the truth.
 *
 * Dependency-free and side-effect-free.

 *
 * So a stock is inverted before it is summed — against the dock's OWN CAPACITY,

 * IS normalised against its own weekly maximum, which is what keeps a

 * The five bands, as a share of the site's OWN weekly maximum.

 *
 * ── MONOTONE IN LIGHTNESS, AND DARK WHERE IT IS BUSY ────────────────────────
 * This ramp shipped once as blue → teal → yellow → orange, and its last step
 * went the WRONG WAY: measured as CIE L*, the five bands read
 * 27 · 50 · 67 · 80 · 58. The busiest band was darker than the one below it, so
 * the order died the moment the hue was taken away — a colour-blind reader, a
 * greyscale print, a washed-out screen — and no opacity setting removed the
 * inversion, because the defect was in the ramp (CARTOGRAPHY B4).
 *
 * The obvious repair — climb all the way, ending on a pale mint — fixed the
 * ordering and broke something worse: measured against the basemap it is drawn
 * over, the busiest band came out at ΔE 11, which over a light city is a blob
 * nobody can see. A ramp has to satisfy BOTH tests, and only one of them is in
 * the doctrine.
 *
 * So it descends, and it descends into the warm: **93 · 80 · 63 · 45 · 27**.
 *
 *   · Ordering survives greyscale, monotonically, by construction.
 *   · The bands stay 6.3 L* apart at the layer's alpha, composited over six
 *     backdrops (light city, mid city, dark roof, park, water, near-white).
 *   · The busy end has ink where it matters — ΔE 24 against the map — and the
 *     calm end deliberately has almost none: a station doing nothing should let
 *     its street show through, which is the whole complaint this answers.
 *   · Closest approach to the two other magnitude ramps painted over these same
 *     streets (`idfm-network`, `comptages-fr`) is ΔE 19. Two layers on one
 *     coordinate may not share a colour.
 *
 * It is warm without being a traffic light: amber → red → carmine, no green
 * anywhere, so it cannot be read as the congestion triad `traffic.js` and
 * `roadStatusFrance.js` own on the same streets.
 *
 * `veloPulseRamp.test.mjs` recomputes the whole compositing chain — including
 * the alpha read out of `veloPulse.js` itself — and fails on any inversion, any
 * band that stops separating, and a busiest band that stops being visible.

 * and a reader comparing two discs is not misled by the fourth power a

 * city in its OWN unit while landing a busy site in either city at a comparable
 * size: a full 40-stand Vélo'v dock and a 350-cyclist Paris rush hour both come
 * out near 150 m. Lyon's docks hold dozens and Paris' counters see hundreds, so
