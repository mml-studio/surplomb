/**
 * ADEME DPE — the energy label of this building, and of every one around it.
 *
 * A diagnostic is compulsory for any French sale, so the register is close to a
 * census of what has changed hands since July 2021 — 15,476,290 rows, geocoded
 * against the BAN. A listing shows one letter. This shows the street's.
 *
 * THE COLOURS ARE THE OFFICIAL ONES. A to G on the state's own DPE scale, dark
 * green through dark red. Inventing a palette here would make the layer
 * unreadable to the only people who already know what the letters mean.
 *
 * NO NEIGHBOURHOOD GRADE. The distribution is reported; the mean is not. A DPE
 * describes one dwelling's envelope and boiler, and the average of a street's
 * letters is not a property of the street.
 *
 * ── WHERE THE PROPERTY IS — one badge per site, on its own building ─────────
 *
 * Reported 2026-09-14: «les points bougent en même temps que je bouge la carte»
 * and «on ne comprend pas exactement où est situé le bien qui a ce DPE». Both
 * had the same cause, and it was not the seating.
 *
 * A default scan of Paris 13e serves 200 diagnostics carrying **14 distinct
 * coordinates**, 13 addresses and 5 RNB identifiers. One coordinate carried
 * **42 badges**. Only the topmost of each pile was ever visible or clickable,
 * the card a click opened was a lottery between forty-two flats, and the point
 * on screen was a BAN geocode — a point on a street, not a building. That is
 * the second complaint, exactly.
 *
 * It caused the first one too. `renderedSurface.js` lifts a mark onto the drawn
 * surface under a budget of 24 probes per pass over six passes, so 200 marks
 * never fit; dozens stayed on the scan-centre fallback height, and a mark at
 * the wrong height under a camera that is not overhead SLIDES when the camera
 * turns. Measured on the live app, 1400 × 900, nadir at 420 m, before and
 * after:
 *
 *                       badges   height error   screen offset   slide / 250 m pan
 *     before               200        25.2 m         25.5 px        **72.6 px**
 *     after                 10         0.0 m          0.0 px           0.0 px
 *
 * So the diagnostics are GROUPED — by building where the register names one, by
 * BAN address otherwise (`dpeSites.js` carries the rule and its one refusal) —
 * and each site draws three things instead of forty-two:
 *
 *   1. **the building's footprint**, washed in the site's own letter and
 *      outlined, clamped to whichever surface is being drawn. On the photoreal
 *      stack the classification climbs the facades, so the answer to «où est le
 *      bien» is a whole building lit in its own colour, with `Bâti 3D` off and
 *      nothing else switched on;
 *   2. **the parcel it stands on**, as a dashed achromatic line and never a
 *      wash — see `PARCEL_LINE_CSS` for why the colour channel cannot be spent
 *      twice;
 *   3. **one badge**, standing inside its own outline rather than on the street.
 *
 * The shapes come from the `/api/dpe` proxy, which resolves them from the RNB
 * (the register's own `id_rnb`, else the building under the BAN point) and the
 * cadastre box the `cadastre-fr` proxy already caches. Neither can withhold the
 * diagnostics: a site with no shape keeps its badge and its card, and the row
 * prints how many of the addresses got an outline.
 *
 * ── The volumes carry the letter now (representation audit, track 1, #78) ───
 *
 * `bdtopoBuildings.js` extrudes the BD TOPO footprints of the viewport, and
 * until now this layer drew a badge floating ABOVE the roof it was talking
 * about. It publishes a theme to `buildingTheme.js` instead: the volume takes
 * the diagnostic's own colour, and the badge stays as the handle and the card.
 * The badge is a SUPPLEMENT, never a replacement — with `Bâti 3D` switched off
 * nothing about this layer changes, byte for byte.
 *
 * • **Precedence 10** — ahead of the two other themes this seam is built for
 *   (€/m², permit state). Not because energy matters more, but because this is
 *   the densest register of the three (15.4 M rows against 4.4 M mutations) and
 *   the only one that grades the BUILDING rather than a transaction on it.
 *
 * • **The reduce rule is the MODE, and the mode is never invented.** Several
 *   diagnostics on one building is the normal case, not the edge case: a block
 *   of flats produces one per sale. The letter painted is the one held by the
 *   most diagnostics on that footprint — an observed value, present in the
 *   data, unlike a mean of letters, which would be an ordinal average of an
 *   ordinal scale whose classes are not evenly spaced (measured on the palette
 *   below: 21.1 to 53.1 ΔE76 between adjacent classes, a factor 2.5). The mode
 *   is also the one summary that survives the shape of the register: the
 *   envelope and the heating plant are SHARED by the whole building, so the
 *   letters of its flats genuinely cluster, and the cluster is the building.
 *
 *   Ties go to the WORSE letter — three C and three E paints E. A tie is a
 *   building the rule cannot summarise, and of the two readings the pessimistic
 *   one is the one that cannot mislead a reader into thinking a *passoire* is
 *   not there. It is also deterministic: the seven letters are distinct, so the
 *   answer never depends on the order the register returned its rows in.
 *
 *   Two rules that were considered and refused. **The most recent** diagnostic
 *   is a property of one flat that happened to sell last, not of the building.
 *   **The worst** turns one bad studio out of forty into a G on a whole block —
 *   the exact overstatement A1 exists to forbid, in the other direction.
 *
 * • **The diagnostic names its building, and that is how it reaches a volume.**
 *   Since 2026-09-07 the projection reads `id_rnb`, and `buildingTheme.js`
 *   joins on it before it looks at any coordinate. The BAN geocode was never a
 *   claim about a BUILDING: it is a point on a street, and it lands in the road
 *   or on a neighbour often enough to matter. Measured over four boxes, the
 *   share of diagnostics that reach a drawn volume goes from 81.8 % to 96.3 %
 *   in Paris 13e and from 40.4 % to 75.7 % in Lyon 2e, and 2 to 83 rows per box
 *   were being painted on the wrong roof. `rnbPivot.js` carries the reasoning;
 *   the two counts are kept apart on the row, because a colour decided by a key
 *   and a colour decided by a dot are not the same claim.
 *
 *   34.5 % to 73.7 % of the rows carry the key depending on the commune, so the
 *   geometric join is not gone — it is the fallback, and it is counted as one.
 *
 * • **What the mode cannot see, stated.** The register publishes `numero_dpe`
 *   (per diagnostic) and `identifiant_ban` (per ADDRESS), and no dwelling key
 *   at all. A flat re-diagnosed in 2021 and again in 2024 therefore votes
 *   twice. De-duplicating on `(identifiant_ban, surface_habitable_logement)`
 *   was tried on paper and refused: in a French apartment block the same floor
 *   plan is stacked storey after storey, so identical surfaces at one address
 *   are the NORMAL case and that key would collapse a whole column of flats
 *   into a single vote. A double vote is a smaller error than a deleted one.
 *
 * • **A site whose diagnostics disagree must not look homogeneous.** A badge
 *   goes QUIET (12 px instead of 20) when the volume under it already says its
 *   own letter, and keeps its full size otherwise. One rule, one meaning (A3):
 *   the size of a badge is how much of it is NOT already said by the volume.
 *   The two can genuinely differ, and the case is not hypothetical — a site is
 *   the set of diagnostics that agree about their ADDRESS, while the theme
 *   buckets by FOOTPRINT, so a courtyard building whose BAN geocode lands on
 *   the street building in front of it paints that footprint with letters no
 *   badge on it claims. A site with no published letter never agrees with
 *   anything, so it keeps its full 16 px — it is the one thing the paint cannot
 *   express. The card states the range in words on top of that.
 *
 * • **The palette is safe against "not measured", and fails the greyscale
 *   test.** Measured over the six BD TOPO usage hues, each washed by
 *   `unknownBuildingCss` and then darkened across the layer's whole height
 *   range: the closest any DPE class comes to any unjoined volume is ΔE76
 *   **58.5** (A `#319834` against a washed `Agricole`), against the 25 the seam
 *   asks for and the 2.3 of a just-noticeable difference. Nothing here can be
 *   read as an absence.
 *
 *   The honest half: converted to grey the official ramp is a HUMP, not a
 *   ladder — L* 55.4, 72.3, 92.8, 96.6, 83.8, 72.1, 52.7 for A to G. B and F
 *   land 0.2 L* apart and A and G 2.7 apart. The B4 test ("convert the ramp to
 *   greyscale, does the order survive?") fails, and it fails for the official
 *   French palette, not for ours. B4's own carve-out is why it is kept: a
 *   strong cultural code outranks Bertinian purity. What it costs is written
 *   down here — under a sensor pass, or for a deuteranope, the PAINTED VOLUME
 *   stops being readable while the BADGE, which draws the letter as a shape,
 *   does not. That is the second reason the badges stay.
 *
 * • **The scan is 200 m wide and the city is 9 km wide (A5, H1).** This layer
 *   asks the ADEME for the 200 nearest diagnostics within 200 m of the point
 *   the camera is looking at; the volumes on screen can span `BDTOPO_MAX_BOX_DEG`
 *   (0.08°, ~9 km). So the unpainted volumes are two different things at once —
 *   never diagnosed, and never asked about — and the theme's "no data" row says
 *   exactly that: *sans DPE dans le rayon scanné*. The row's coverage line
 *   carries the numbers that go with it: diagnostics served over diagnostics
 *   known within the radius (2,805 within 300 m of one Paris 13e point, so the
 *   200-row page is a truncation and says so), then volumes painted over
 *   volumes loaded.
 *
 * • **A theme with nothing to paint does not take the city's colours away.**
 *   When the scan comes back with no published letter at all — a rural point,
 *   or a camera above the scan ceiling — the theme is WITHDRAWN rather than
 *   registered empty. A grey city under an all-zero legend reads as a broken
 *   layer, and the wash only means anything as a contrast to a measurement that
 *   exists somewhere on screen.
 *
 * ── Why the join is run twice, and what it costs ────────────────────────────
 *
 * The seam runs its own join inside `bdtopoBuildings.js` to decide the colours.
 * This module runs a SECOND one, over `bdtopoLoadedFootprints()`, because the
 * badge and its card are drawn here and neither the badge size nor the card's
 * "immeuble : 12 DPE, de B à F" line can be written without knowing which
 * footprint a diagnostic landed on. Measured on this machine, best of nine,
 * with the ring copy included:
 *
 *     3 000 volumes × 200 diagnostics    0.6 ms copy + 0.9 ms join
 *     14 000 volumes (the cap) × 200     1.8 ms copy + 8.6 ms join
 *
 * — on a path already debounced 450 ms behind the camera settling, against the
 * 2 to 10 dropped frames the naive nested loop cost the seam. Both joins run
 * the same pure `dpeBuildingSummary()` over the same points, so they cannot
 * disagree about a building they both see.
 *
 * `registerBuildingTheme()` is not followed by an `applyBuildingTheme()` call
 * and the BD TOPO layer is not asked to repaint. Registering ALREADY notifies
 * it — it subscribes in its own `init()` — and the second call would be a
 * second full repaint of the batch per scan. In the one case where the
 * subscription does not exist yet, `Bâti 3D` never having been switched on, the
 * manager initialises layers lazily and an explicit call would find no records
 * either; the volumes are painted a moment later by the layer's own first
 * `drawRecords()`, which resolves the active theme before its first colour.
 *
 * The traffic runs the other way too — the volume layer reloads its tiles on
 * its own, without telling anyone — so this module treats a call to its own
 * `reduce()` as the signal that the city was repainted, and re-syncs the badges
 * on the microtask after it. That is the only notification the seam offers, and
 * it is what makes the badges quieten down when `Bâti 3D` comes on after this
 * layer, with no rescan and no request.

 * — one flat, picked by whichever of the forty-two billboards stacked on that
 * coordinate the click happened to land on. The other forty-one were drawn at

 * needs them:
 *
 *   1. the spread — `14 DPE, de C à G, majorité E`. The distribution IS the
 *      answer for a block; a single letter for forty-two flats would be the
 *      neighbourhood grade this layer has always refused to invent.
