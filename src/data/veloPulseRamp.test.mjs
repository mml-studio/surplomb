// src/data/veloPulseRamp.test.mjs
// The lock on the heat field's colours.
//
// This layer paints over imagery nobody chose: the same band lands on a white
// roof, on a forest, on water and on a night city, and what a reader perceives
// is the COMPOSITE, not the swatch. The ramp shipped once with an inversion at
// the top — the busiest band drawn darker than the one below it — and no
// opacity setting could have hidden it, because the defect was in the ramp.
//
// So this file recomputes the whole chain the eye actually receives (sRGB →
// linear → CIE L*, composited at the layer's own alpha over eight backdrops)
// and fails if any pair of neighbouring bands inverts or gets too close. It is
// the same method `choroplethAlpha.test.mjs` uses on the French choropleths.
//
// CARTOGRAPHY B3 ("six declared classes do not make six perceived classes")
// and B4 ("convert the ramp to grayscale — does the order survive?").
