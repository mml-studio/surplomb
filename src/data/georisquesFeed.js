/**
 * Géorisques feed projection — the seam between the state's own risk register
 * and what the browser is served.
 *
 * WHAT THIS SOURCE ACTUALLY IS. Géorisques (BRGM, for the Ministère de la
 * Transition écologique) is the register behind the **état des risques**, the
 * document a French seller is legally obliged to hand a buyer. The same facts
 * are normally read weeks into a purchase, at the compromis. Read from a
 * coordinate instead, they are readable before the first visit.
 *
 * MEASURED against the live API on 2026-09-01, at 2.3760,48.8300 (Paris 13e):
 *   - `GET /api/v1/resultats_rapport_risque?latlon=LON,LAT&rayon=1000`
 *     → 200, 3,260 bytes, `access-control-allow-origin: *`,
 *       `cache-control: no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate`
 *   - `GET /api/v1/installations_classees?latlon=LON,LAT&rayon=1000&page_size=…`
 *     → 200, 7,007 bytes, 30 establishments; the same call at rayon=2000
 *       returns 256, so the radius is the whole cost control
 *   - `GET /api/v1/radon?code_insee=75113` → 200, 179 bytes,
 *     `data[0].classe_potentiel: "1"`
 *
 * THE ONE STRUCTURAL FACT WORTH CARRYING. `risquesNaturels` and
 * `risquesTechnologiques` are OBJECTS keyed by hazard, not arrays, and each
 * hazard carries TWO verdicts: `libelleStatutCommune` and
 * `libelleStatutAdresse`. On the 13e, ICPE reads "Risque Concerne" for the
 * commune and "Risque non Concerne" for the address. That gap is the
 * difference between "true anywhere around here" and "depends on your street",
 * and the upstream already computes it — so this projection TRANSPORTS both
 * verdicts rather than collapsing them into one boolean. Collapsing them would
 * manufacture a certainty the source declined to make.
 *
 * A SECOND TRAP, ENCODED HERE SO IT IS NOT REDISCOVERED. `commune.codeInsee`
 * comes back as `75056` — Paris as a single commune — not the arrondissement.
 * The radon endpoint is keyed by INSEE code and accepts the arrondissement
 * (`75113`), so the caller passes the code it resolved from the BAN rather
 * than the one this report echoes. See `dvfFeed.js`, which is broken by the
 * same distinction in a louder way.
 *
 * Side-effect-free: URL construction and projection only, so a unit test can
 * point at a captured response. The `/api/georisques` proxy imports it, and so
 * does `georisques.js` — for the two LABEL helpers at the bottom only
 * ({@link radonClassLabel}, {@link icpeSiteName}), which exist because the
 * server publishes French and the browser has to say the same thing in its own
 * language. Nothing else here reaches the browser.
