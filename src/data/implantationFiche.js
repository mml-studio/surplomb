/**
 * Fiche implantation — the one card a geomarketing tool exists to print.
 *
 * WHAT IT ANSWERS. Click a door. How many people live within ten minutes' walk
 * of it, what do they earn, what may be built on the plot, and what did the
 * ground around it last sell for. Every half of that is already in this
 * repository — `isochrone-fr` has the reachable shape, `filosofi-fr` has who
 * lives in every 200 m square, the urbanism layer has the zoning, DVF has the
 * sales — and nothing has ever joined them. The join IS the product.
 *
 * THE HEADLINE IS A BRACKET, NOT A NUMBER. A 200 m square either sits inside
 * the ring, outside it, or across its edge. Every commercial tool picks a
 * convention and prints one figure; this one prints the centroid count with the
 * two countable bounds around it — the population of the squares ENTIRELY
 * inside, and of every square the ring TOUCHES. `implantationFeed.js` carries
 * the reasoning; the consequence on screen is that a reader sees how much of
 * the answer is boundary. Areal interpolation would have produced a tidier
 * number by assuming people are spread evenly inside a square, which is exactly
 * what INSEE's own imputation flag exists to deny.
 *
 * WHY IT COMPOSES IN THE BROWSER AND ADDS NO PROXY. The four sources it needs
 * are four routes this server already has, already cached, already tested —
 * `/api/isochrone`, `/api/filosofi/carreaux`, `/api/gpu`, `/api/dvf`. A fifth
 * route would have to duplicate their load logic server-side and would miss
 * their caches. So the layer fans out across them in parallel and does the join
 * locally: the join is arithmetic over data the browser already has, and it is
 * pure and unit-tested. The shared address-scan factory takes a `fetchImpl`
 * seam, and this is what that seam is for.
 *
 * WALKING ONLY, AND THREE DURATIONS. A catchment brief is written in walking
 * minutes — "dix minutes à pied" — so the chips are 5, 10 and 15, and the
 * driving ring stays the isochrone layer's own control. One ring per scan, so
 * the fiche costs one isochrone call rather than three.
 *
 * AND THE FIGURES NOW SAY WHERE THEY STAND. "1,04 km² atteignables" is a fact
 * nobody can read without a country to read it against, so the card carries a
 * national percentile beside it and, for the three indicators whose direction
 * is a defensible judgement rather than an opinion, an A→E letter.
 * `baremeNational.js` holds the measured ladders and every refusal; `FICHE_SCORED`
 * below is the join, and its `geometry` functions are what stop a fifteen-minute
 * ring from being graded on a ten-minute scale. THE DURATION CHIPS ARE THE
 * REASON THAT GUARD EXISTS: the same indicators mean something else on a wider
 * ring, and the ladder was measured at ten minutes only.
