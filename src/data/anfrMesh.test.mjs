// What the MAILLAGE is allowed to claim about a country it is only sampling.
//
// The mesh exists because 72 700 masts cannot be drawn at once and the pack
// that describes them (1 046 KB gzipped, measured on the real payload) is 2.7×
// what the tuple costs (392 KB). Everything it drops has to drop honestly, and
// two rules carry that:
//
//   1. **A cell is represented by its MODAL band, ties going to the lower
//      index.** The distribution is lopsided — 50 148 of 72 700 supports are
//      `5g` — so representing a cell by its largest member would paint rural
//      France 5G on the strength of one upgraded mast per cell, and a tie
//      going the other way would draw an approved project as a live 5G mast.
//   2. **The pick reports what it dropped.** `inBox` and `thinned` are the
//      only reason a reader can tell 1 100 dots from 1 100 masts.
//
// The third property here is a correction. `anfrMesh.js`'s own docstring says
// no two supports share a coordinate to five decimals. Measured over the real
// register on 2026-09-02 that is FALSE — 952 supports share a position with at
// least one other, 895 positions are occupied twice or more, the worst by six
// masts — which is why `anfrFrance.js` keys its exact records by SUP_ID and
// treats a mesh id as a position rather than an identity. The last test pins
// that, so the claim cannot quietly become load-bearing later.
