/*
 * LAYER TAXONOMY — the one place that says what each dataset IS.
 *
 * The Data Layers panel used to render `getAll()` in registration order, which
 * is the order the layers were merged in. That was an accident, not a decision:
 * the French energy layers sat together because their PRs landed back to back,
 * and Marine Buoys sat between Mapped Installations and Datacenters for no
 * reason at all. This file replaces that accident with a stated grouping.
 *
 * WHY A CENTRAL FILE AND NOT A `category:` FIELD ON EACH LAYER MODULE
 *
 * Grouping and ordering are product decisions about the WHOLE set — "does
 * Defence stand apart from Air & Space?" is not a question any single layer
 * module can answer. Spread across 27 modules those decisions become unreviewable;
 * here they are one diff. This mirrors LAYER_STATE_REGISTRY in ./layerState.js,
 * which already owns the other cross-cutting per-layer decision (share tokens).
 *
 * EXHAUSTIVENESS IS ENFORCED, NOT DOCUMENTED
 *
 * `validateLayerTaxonomy()` runs at import and cross-checks this table against
 * REGISTERED_LAYER_IDS in both directions. Adding a data layer without giving it
 * a category is therefore a BOOT FAILURE, not a row that quietly lands in
 * whatever group it was appended next to. Same contract, same reason, as the
 * duplicate-token assertion next door.
 *
 * WHAT READS THIS
 *
 * `main.js` hands both tables to `finalizeRegistrations()`, and the Data Layers
 * panel renders one collapsible group per category, each row showing `label`
 * (the French name) plus a scope chip derived from `coverage`. `name` — the
 * English string on the layer module — stays the canonical id-adjacent name and
 * is what the voice layer and the LLM scene context still report; only the
 * human-facing surfaces moved to `label`.
 *
 * A manager sealed WITHOUT these tables still renders the old flat list. That
 * is not dead code: `getAll()` already documents "null when sealed without a
 * taxonomy", and the unit tests build bare managers that way.
