/**
 * @module viewGate
 *
 * "Zoom in to load" — carried out instead of announced.
 *
 * Several layers only answer for a bounded camera: BD TOPO refuses a box wider
 * than 0.08°, the mapped grid refuses one wider than 0.8°. The ceiling is real
 * — it is what keeps one click from asking a public service for half a country
 * — but the operator turning the layer on from a continental view was left
 * holding an instruction instead of a layer, and (because a load that fetched
 * nothing reported itself as a failed load) a toggle that flipped straight back
 * to OFF with "could not start cleanly". That reads as a broken layer. It is
 * not: it is a camera that has not been asked to move yet.
 *
 * So this module moves it. Given the ceiling a layer loads behind, it computes
 * the view that fits under it, flies there, and then RE-ASKS the layer's own
 * gate — the same predicate that will decide the load a moment later, not a
 * second opinion about it. If the answer is still no, it tightens and tries
 * again, twice, and gives up honestly rather than looping.
 *
 * ── What it is careful about ────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * • **The ceiling is in degrees, and a degree of longitude is not a degree of
 *   latitude.** At Lyon a degree of longitude is 700 m shorter than a degree of
 *   latitude, so the metre span that fits under a 0.08° ceiling is the one the
 *   LONGITUDE axis allows. Sizing off latitude alone overshoots the gate by
 *   45% in France and lands the flight right back on "zoom in".
 *
 * • **Altitude alone cannot satisfy a box ceiling.** A camera at 600 m looking
 *   at the horizon sees to the horizon: the view rectangle stays kilometres
 *   wide no matter how low it goes. The pitch is therefore steepened to at
 *   least `VIEW_GATE_MIN_PITCH_DEG` before any height is solved — and left
 *   alone when it is already steeper, because the operator's angle is theirs.
 *
 * • **It zooms in, never out.** The solved height is capped by the height the
 *   camera already has. A shallow view from 600 m needs the pitch, not 1.9 km
 *   of extra altitude, and pulling the camera back to "fix" it would be a
 *   worse answer than the guidance it replaces.
 *
 * • **It aims at what the operator is looking at.** The focus is the centre of
 *   the current view, pulled onto the layer's coverage when that centre falls
 *   outside it and the coverage is a real part of the shot — a camera framing
 *   France with its centre in the Bay of Biscay should land on France, not on
 *   water. A sliver at the edge of a camera aimed somewhere else is not, and
 *   the gate declines to fly at all rather than teleport away from the subject
 *   (see `viewGateFocus`).
