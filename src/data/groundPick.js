/**
 * Where on the globe a screen point lands.
 *
 * The one question every layer that draws GROUND has to answer, and the one
 * `scene.pick` answers badly. Ground-classification geometry — the cadastral
 * parcels, the PLU wash — is picked by whichever shadow volume the ray enters
 * first, and at the grazing angles this globe is flown at that is not reliably
 * the shape under the pointer: `cadastreParcels.js` paid for that lesson by
 * lighting up a parcel somewhere else. A layer that already holds its polygons
 * in memory should ask them directly, and to do that it needs a coordinate.
 *
 * THREE SOURCES, IN THE ORDER OF HOW WELL EACH ANSWERS "WHAT IS THE OPERATOR
 * POINTING AT". The rendered terrain first, because that is the surface the
 * shapes are draped on and it is exact. The depth buffer second, which is what
 * answers on the photoreal stack where the globe is hidden. The bare ellipsoid
 * last, which ignores relief and is wrong by the local terrain height times the
 * tangent of the view angle — acceptable as a floor, never as a first choice.
 *
 * AND THE DEPTH BUFFER IS VALIDATED, not trusted. Over empty sky it hands back
 * a finite Cartesian that is not a place: `isPickedWorldPosition` rejects the
 * ones that would otherwise convert without complaint into somewhere
 * underground and reverse-geocode as 0°, 0°.
