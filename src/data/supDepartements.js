 * @module supDepartements
 *
 * The national regime of the higher-education layer: 6 914 sites folded onto
 * the 96 bundled département polygons.
 *
 * ── Why this one folds SITES and the schools one folds ROWS ─────────────────
 * `schoolsDepartements.js` runs its point-in-polygon over the raw register,
 * because there its raw register IS one row per drawn dot. Here it is not: the
 * Atlas publishes one row per (établissement × composante × degré d'études),
 * seven of which can describe one campus. So the projection in `supFeed.js`
 * resolves the sites first and this file folds THOSE — the same objects the
 * map draws, which is what makes the choropleth's total and the dot count
 * agree by construction rather than by coincidence.
 *
 * ── What the HEIGHT carries, and why it is not the dot count ────────────────
 * **Students.** This is a deliberate departure from `schoolsDepartements.js`,
 * which bins on establishments and argues, correctly for it, that a national
 * regime shading by anything other than the drawn unit is "a different map
 * wearing the same legend". Higher education is the case where that rule
 * gives the wrong map, and it is worth stating why rather than quietly
 * flipping it.
 *
 * Measured on the real rollup. Counting SITES, Paris (484) leads the Nord
 * (292) by 1.66× and the ten leading départements hold **35%** of them.
 * Counting STUDENTS, Paris (394 788) leads the Rhône (192 964) by 2.05× and
 * the top ten hold **49.8%** — half of French higher education in ten
 * départements. The site count is flatter because 2 800 of the 6 914 sites are
 * lycées running a BTS, and those follow the secondary-school network, which
 * is spread by population across the whole country. Both numbers are true;
 * only the second is about higher education. A map of where BTS sections are
 * is a map of where lycées are, and `schools-fr` already draws that.
 *
 * Students are an ABSOLUTE count, so they now travel on the prism's HEIGHT and
 * no longer on a colour fill — `choroplethPrism.js` holds that grammar and
 * `supFrance.js` holds this layer's calibration. The site count travels on
 * every département's card beside it, so the two are never read as each other.
 *
 * ── What the COLOUR carries: a rate this file can actually compute ──────────
 * The prism needs a ratio for its hue (CARTOGRAPHY B1), and the ratio a
 * reader would want first — students per 1 000 INHABITANTS — is not derivable
 * here: no population figure reaches this module, and inventing one from
 * another layer's feed would be a source, not an arithmetic. Two candidates
 * were computable from these very rows, and they were measured against each
 * other on the real rollup (96 départements, rentrée 2024) by Spearman rank
 * correlation with the student count and by mean rank displacement:
 *
 *   students per 1 000 km² (`per1000Km2`)   ρ = 0.974   mean shift  4.3 places
 *   share at bac+4 and beyond               ρ = 0.880   mean shift 10.4 places
 *
 * The density is very nearly the height drawn a second time — it moves a
 * département by four places out of ninety-six — and A3 exists to stop a
 * second channel restating the first. Its spread makes it worse, not better:
 * 156 to 3 812 827 students per 1 000 km², a factor of 24 500 whose top four
 * classes are the four départements of the petite couronne, so the hue would
 * be an Île-de-France detector rather than a rate.
 *
 * So the published rate is `advancedShare`: the share of a département's
 * students enrolled at bac+4 or beyond (`master` + `doctorat` over the cycles
 * the register grades). It separates the two ways of being big — Ariège is
 * 94th by enrolment and 35th by share, Allier is 60th and 91st — which is
 * exactly what the height cannot say. Measured range 0.0 % (Ardèche, Cantal,
 * Corse-du-Sud, Haute-Loire: real zeros, not gaps) to 46.0 % (Essonne, i.e.
 * Saclay), median 17.4 %.
 *
 * C4, applied: the share is a ratio of SUMS — master + doctorat summed over
 * the département's sites, divided by the graded total summed the same way —
 * never a mean of per-site shares. And the denominator is the graded total
 * rather than `students`, because `supFeed.js` drops any `degre_etudes` it
 * does not recognise: on this vintage the two are equal on all 96 départements
 * (2 902 711 = 2 902 711), and if a future vintage breaks that equality the
 * rate must be over the population that was actually graded. A département
 * with nothing graded gets `advancedShare: null` — no denominator, no rate,
 * and the map draws that refusal instead of a zero (A1).
 *
 * ── The quantile bin is still published, and the map no longer reads it ─────
 * `bin` and `thresholds` remain in the payload: they are part of this rollup's
 * published shape. They are a quantile cut over the rows in hand, which is
 * precisely what C1 forbids on the map — a poll that lost a stripe would move
 * every boundary and repaint départements nothing happened to. The prism's
 * colour ladder is a frozen literal in `supFrance.js` instead.
 *
 * ── What the 96 polygons cannot hold ────────────────────────────────────────
 * They are METROPOLITAN — 96 features, no overseas geometry — so **214 of the
 * 6 914 sites, holding 57 301 students, fall outside every one of them**:
 * La Réunion 79, Guadeloupe 41, Martinique 41, Guyane 21, Mayotte 15,
 * Polynésie française 12, Saint-Martin 4. They are counted, named by the
 * register's own `dep_num_nom`, and returned as `offshore` rather than snapped
 * or dropped — the nearest French polygon to a campus in Cayenne is 7 000 km
 * away. The national card states the shortfall instead of letting a
 * choropleth claim France has 2.90 million students.
 *
 * The 214th is a different fact and is reported the same way: ONE site in the
 * Bas-Rhin (21 students) sits further outside the simplified outlines than the
 * snap reaches. The 2 km coastal snap is the shared one from
 * `franceDepartements.js` — the measurement behind the number lives in
 * `irveDepartements.js`, where it was made — and it rescues 10 sites that
 * landed in the drawn sea. It cannot reach Guadeloupe, which is the point.
 *
 * The prism does not soften this and must not: 57 301 students that no polygon
 * can hold are 57 301 students with no height. `unassigned` and `offshore`
 * travel to the legend, where A5 wants them.
 *
 * Dependency-free and side-effect-free (no Cesium, no DOM) so it runs
 * identically in the browser, in the Vite dev-server proxy, and under
 * `node --test`.
