# The app is not a static bundle: vite.config.js carries ~35 middleware
# proxies that broker keys, cache upstream responses on disk and hold the AIS
# websocket. So the runtime is `vite preview` (built bundle + those proxies),
# not a file server — which is why the dev dependencies stay in the image.
