/**
 * @module data/cadastreLineage
 *
 * Where a permit's parcel went after the surveyor split it.
 *
 * Sitadel carries no coordinate (`adsFeed.js`, TRAP 4) but it does carry up to
 * three cadastral references, and the cadastre is open. Placing a permit on
 * the plot it names is therefore free — for the 58.1% of rows whose parcel
 * still exists. Measured over the 543 Sitadel rows of Ustaritz (64547) since
 * 2013:
 *
 *   parcelle citée toujours vivante                        315   58.1%
 *   parcelle disparue du cadastre courant                  202   37.3%
 *   référence provisoire, suffixe lettre («255P»)           25    4.6%
 *   … et 298 rows (55.0%) carry no house number at all.
 *
 * THE 37% IS THE INTERESTING PART, and it is not a data error. A parcel
 * disappears because it was DIVIDED, and a permit is very often the reason it
 * was: file on a field, split the field, build on a lot. So the reference is
 * dead precisely BECAUSE the permit did what it asked to do. Dropping those
 * rows to a street-level geocode — which is what the layer did before this
 * module — throws away the one register that knows where the building went.
 *
 * ── The chain, and the case it was written from ─────────────────────────────
 * Permit `06454721B0009`: parcelle `AN 221`, no house number, 1 317 m² of
 * declared land, 1 dwelling of 94 m², chantier open 2022-04-15, finished
 * 2023-04-15.
 *
 *   1. AN 221 is absent from the 8 072 parcels of today's Ustaritz.
 *   2. Etalab publishes DATED snapshots of the whole cadastre. AN 221 is
 *      present at 2021-04-01 and gone at 2021-07-01 — divided three months
 *      before the permit was granted. Its outline measures 1 372 m² against
 *      the 1 317 declared, a 4% disagreement.
 *   3. Three of today's parcels have their anchor inside that outline:
 *      AN 511 (811 m²), AN 512 (527) and AN 513 (34). They sum to 1 372 m²,
 *      to the square metre — which is what a division looks like and what
 *      {@link childrenOf}'s area guard tests for.
 *   4. Buildings, on the same two snapshots: AN 511 already carried 188 + 12 m²
 *      in 2021 and gained nothing; AN 513 — 34 m², the lotissement's access
 *      strip — never carried anything; AN 512 went from ZERO to one building
 *      of 76 m². Against 94 m² of declared floor area over two levels, that is
 *      the house.
 *   5. The commune's BAL names it: `64547000AN0512` is **18 Impasse de
 *      Haroztegia**.
 *
 * The number 18 never appears in the permit. It falls out of the chain.
 *
 * ── Why it stops at the parent when it cannot pick a child ──────────────────
 * Measured over the 125 ambiguous divisions of Ustaritz authorised since 2018,
 * the building diff alone names exactly one child in **29.6%** of cases. In
 * 45.6% several children built — usually because several permits name the same
 * parent, a lotissement being a lotissement — and in 24.8% nothing was built
 * at all. So two thirds of the time there is no child to pick, and this module
 * hands back the PARENT outline rather than a guess. A 1 372 m² polygon that
 * certainly contains the site beats a confident dot in the middle of the road,
 * and {@link ADS_LINEAGE_BASIS} makes the difference legible on the card.
 *
 * ── The archive floor is 2017, and the loss profile says so ─────────────────
 * Etalab's oldest snapshot is 2017-07-06. Of the 227 unusable references,
 * 67.4% are recoverable overall — but that average hides the shape. Per year of
 * authorisation, permits that could not be placed at all:
 *
 *   2013–2016   61 of 161      (no snapshot exists that far back)
 *   2018–2021    5 of 227
 *   2022–2026    2 of 115
 *
 * Nothing can be done about the first line, and this module does not pretend
 * otherwise — {@link LINEAGE_ARCHIVE_FLOOR} is the honest edge of the method.
 *
 * Dependency-free and side-effect-free (no Cesium, no DOM, no fetch): URL
 * construction, geometry and decision logic only. The `/api/ads-fr` proxy
 * imports it; nothing in the browser bundle does.
