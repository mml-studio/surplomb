/**
 * How a moving contact says it is coasting on dead reckoning rather than
 * reporting — and why that is not an alpha.
 *
 * ── The channel conflict ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The aircraft layers composed THREE independent facts into a single alpha:
 *
 *   • freshness — `baseAlpha: _missingPolls.get(icao24) ? 0.45 : 1`
 *   • distance to the limb — `aircraftRecession`'s `alphaFloor` (0.35)
 *   • focus de-emphasis — the tracked-contact `dimFloor` (0.25)
 *
 * Multiplied together, they are not recoverable. A faint sprite could be a
 * contact whose position is minutes old, or one near the horizon, or one the
 * camera is not following — three different statements sharing one variable
 * (CARTOGRAPHY A3: one visual variable, one fact).
 *
 * Alpha keeps DEPTH, which is what a reader already reads it as on a globe.
 * Freshness moves to the sprite's own colour.
 *
 * ── Why a desaturating mix, not a fade ──────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * "Desaturate toward grey" is the textbook answer and it does nothing to the
 * civil fleet, which is already pure white — zero saturation. The operation
 * that works for BOTH tints is a mix toward a neutral mid-grey: it removes the
 * amber from a military contact AND takes the white fleet down off maximum
 * value, in one step, without touching alpha.
 *
 * The result stays fully opaque, so a coasting contact is exactly as VISIBLE
 * as a reporting one — it has not gone anywhere, and hiding it would be its own
 * false statement. It is only less vivid.
