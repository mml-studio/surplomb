/**
 * What you can say — the discoverability list.
 *
 * A voice cockpit with 29 tools and 59 data layers is undiscoverable by design
 * unless something says so: the mic looks identical whether it can do one thing
 * or a hundred, and an operator who tries twice and misses twice stops trying.
 * These are the phrasings that reach the widest part of the surface, in the
 * language the fork is actually used in.
 *
 * ONE LIST, TWO READERS. The dock rotates three of these while it is idle, and
 * the same strings are named in the shipped instructions so "que puis-je dire ?"
 * is answered from the prompt without a tool call. A unit test holds the two in
 * agreement — a suggestion the model cannot honour is worse than no suggestion.
 *
 * Every line here must be answerable by a tool that exists. When one stops
 * being true, delete it: this file is a promise, not a wish list.
 */

/**
 * Spoken examples, French first — the fork's own language.
 *
 * NOT a catalog, and that is the point: both lists exist at once, and which
 * one is shown is decided by the SESSION's language, not the page's. They are
 * usually the same now that the page's locale reaches the session
 * (`resolveVoiceSessionLanguage`), but `GEV_VOICE_LANGUAGE=de-DE` still makes
 * them differ, and a reader on a French page may hold a session in English.
 * A `{fr, en}` leaf would only ever hand back the page's language.
