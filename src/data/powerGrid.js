/**
 * Power Grid — the high-voltage network as OpenStreetMap has mapped it, for the
 * viewport you are looking at.
 *
 * Three things, drawn together because the grid only reads as a system when
 * they are:
 *
 *   **the routes**  — `power=line` and `power=cable` ways at 50 kV and above,
 *                     clamped to the ground, coloured by voltage band, with the
 *                     underground half dashed so it is never mistaken for a
 *                     pylon route
 *   **the nodes**   — `power=substation` yards at the same voltages, sized by
 *                     band, which is where those routes actually terminate
 *   **the pylons**  — a Temaki `power_tower` glyph on the mapped vertices of the
 *                     overhead ways, at the spacing the camera can read, tinted
 *                     with the route's own voltage colour
 *
 * Keyless, ODbL 1.0, all through the `/api/power-grid` proxy. The upstream traps
 * live in `powerGridFeed.js` under test against a captured Overpass response;
 * this module is the drawing.
 *
 * ── What the drawing is careful about ───────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * • **A stroke is on the ground because the height is not published.** A 400 kV
 *   conductor hangs 20-40 m up and OSM records that for about a third of pylons
 *   and for no line at all. So the routes are clamped ground polylines — the
 *   mapped ROUTE, drawn where it is known to be — and the card says so. Lifting
 *   them to a plausible catenary would be inventing the one number the data
 *   withholds.
 *
 * • **This is volunteer mapping, not a grid register.** RTE publishes no public
 *   geometry, which is why this layer exists at all; OSM's coverage of it is
 *   excellent in France and uneven elsewhere. An empty viewport means nothing is
 *   MAPPED there, and the empty state says exactly that rather than "no grid".
 *
 * • **Voltage is the filter because voltage is the evidence.** Anything OSM has
 *   not given a voltage is not drawn — not demoted, not guessed. That is also
 *   why the legend counts by band rather than by feature type.
 *
 * • **A stroke is not a line.** OSM splits one named liaison across dozens of
 *   ways at every junction and attribute change, so the layer reports both: the
 *   stroke count it drew, and the distinct mapped ROUTE names behind them.
 *
 * • **The ground is where these objects are.** Substations and pylons sit on the
 *   local ground floor, and strokes are clamped ground polylines classified
 *   against ONLY the active surface — the rule the submarine-cable, Vigicrues
 *   and gas layers established, with BOTH as the safe fallback for an unknown
 *   stack.
 *
 * ── WHAT THE 2026-09-14 PASS CHANGED, AND WHY ───────────────────────────────
 *
 * The operator's report was three sentences and every one of them was a real
 * defect. They are recorded here because each fix is a rule, not a tweak.
 *
 * 1. **"Il faut un certain zoom, une certaine inclinaison pour que le réseau
 *    daigne bien se montrer."** The request box was the span of
 *    `computeViewRectangle`, which on a tilted camera reaches the HORIZON —
 *    0.278° of longitude at Bayonne looking straight down from 19.5 km, and
 *    1.076° at a 35° pitch from the SAME altitude. The 0.8° ceiling fell
 *    between the two, so the layer refused the oblique view this globe opens
 *    on. The box is now `focusedViewBox` around what the camera is aiming at,
 *    sized from the ALTITUDE (`powerBoxDegForAltitude`) and gated on it
 *    (`POWER_GRID_MAX_ALTITUDE_M`). See `powerViewportBox`.
 *
 * 2. **"Le tracé se fait via un tout petit trait, c'est quasi invisible."**
 *    True at 1.6–3.2 px with no casing. The bands are 3–5.5 px now and every
 *    stroke is drawn twice, near-black and wider underneath. See `buildStrokes`.
 *
 * 3. **"J'ai pas l'impression qu'il y ait une légende."** There was one, and
 *    the layer was deleting it: a camera past the ceiling ran `clearRendered()`,
 *    which nulls `_payload`, and the key is built from `_payload.tiers`. A
 *    camera moving does not make mapped geometry wrong, so what was loaded now
 *    stays drawn — and keyed — until it leaves the shot. See `load`.
 *
 * ── WHAT THE 2026-09-19 PASS CHANGED: A NATIONAL LAYER UNDER THE VIEWPORT ───
 *
 * "Il met beaucoup de temps à s'afficher, et j'aimerais qu'il s'affiche même
 * avec une vue bien dézoomée et nationale." Both halves were true, and both
 * had the same cause: every route on screen came from a live Overpass query,
 * so nothing could be drawn above the 120 km that query tolerates, and every
 * box nobody had asked for yet cost 4 to 21 s of Overpass before a line
 * appeared. The gas layer, which the operator was happy with, has neither
 * problem because its whole network is one file.
 *
 * So the grid now has one too: `local_data/power_grid_fr/national.json`, every
 * high-voltage route and substation mapped in France, simplified to 50 m and
 * shipped as a static asset (`powerGridNational.js` says what was cut and why).
 * The layer draws it at ANY altitude, band by band (`powerGridNationalBand`):
 * the 400/225 kV backbone from space, the 63/90 kV mesh under 600 km. Under
 * 120 km the per-viewport path still loads — pylons, named yards, the exact
 * mapped vertices — and as its answer lands, the national strokes it covers
 * are hidden ONE WAY AT A TIME (`syncNationalHidden`), so the viewport answer
 * replaces them in place and the rest of the country stays drawn around it.
 * Until that answer arrives, and if it never does, the national strokes are
 * what the operator sees: the wait for Overpass is a refinement now, not a
 * blank globe.

 * the traffic layer's congestion underlay uses.
 *
 * The split is by what has to differ: overhead strokes share ONE primitive and
 * carry their band colour as a per-instance attribute, while underground ones
 * need a dashed material and a material is per-primitive, so they get one batch
 * per band. Six batches at most, whatever the stroke count.
 *
 * ── THE CASING IS THE FIRST BATCH, AND IT IS WHY THIS LAYER IS VISIBLE ──────
 *
 * Every stroke is drawn TWICE: once near-black and `POWER_GRID_CASING_PX`
 * wider, then once in its band colour. Without it a #7ee0a8 line at 1.6 px over
 * a pine plantation is, in the operator's words, "quasi invisible" — a coloured
 * line on an orthophoto has no reliable background, and the answer cartography
 * has for that is a casing, not a louder hue. The casing instances go in FIRST,
 * in their own primitive, because `scene.groundPrimitives` draws in insertion
 * order and the core has to land on top of its own shadow.
 *
 * Per-instance colour is safe on a GROUND POLYLINE and is not safe on a ground
 * POLYGON: a polyline's shadow volume culls by distance to the line, so it does
 * not have the bounding-rectangle rule that forces one colour per batch on
 * `GroundPrimitive`. `PolylineOutline` would fold casing and core into one
 * pass and cannot be used at all here — Cesium's ground-polyline fragment
 * shader never declares the `v_width` varying that material reads, so the
 * primitive fails to link.

/**
 * Draw a pylon along every mapped overhead route, at the rhythm this camera can

 *
 * ── WHY THIS EXISTS AND WHAT IT IS ALLOWED TO CLAIM ─────────────────────────
 *
 * The layer used to draw `power=tower` nodes as 4 px grey dots, below 0.25° of
 * view and nowhere else. At that size a pylon is not a structure, it is a
 * speck; and above that zoom the overhead network had nothing on it at all, so
 * a red line and a red dashed line were the only difference between a corridor
 * of 400 kV steel and a trench.
 *
 * So the mark is Temaki's `power_tower` — CC0, the glyph the OpenStreetMap iD
 * editor puts on the tag — tinted with the route's own voltage colour, and it
 * is placed by `powerPylonMarks` on the MAPPED VERTICES of the overhead ways.
 * Not at an interpolated spacing: the vertices of a `power=line` way ARE its
 * pylons (574 of 574 tagged towers fell on one at Bayonne, 750 of 775 at
 * Saclay, see `powerPylonMarks` for what the 25 are), so the rhythm can be
 * honoured by SKIPPING vertices and never by inventing one between them.
 *
 * Two consequences are load-bearing:
 *
 *   • The mark is drawn from the STROKES, so it appears at every zoom the
 *     strokes do — there is no second request and no second ceiling. The
 *     `power=tower` NODES are still fetched below
 *     `POWER_GRID_TOWER_MAX_BOX_DEG`, and what they add is the CARD: a
 *     reference, a design, a height. A mark that finds one is a pylon with a
 *     record; a mark that does not is a vertex of the mapped way, and its card
 *     says exactly that rather than promoting it.
 *
 *   • The spacing is re-solved on every camera settle, not once per load.
 *     Zooming out thins the marks instead of clumping them; zooming in walks
 *     back down to every mapped vertex, which on a French 400 kV line is every
 *     pylon there is.
