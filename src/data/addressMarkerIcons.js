 * @module addressMarkerIcons
 *
 * WHICH REGISTER a marker comes from, drawn as a silhouette.
 *
 * The six French address layers all answer a question about the SAME
 * building. Turn on Ventes immobilières and Performance énergétique together
 * and, until this module existed, you got two clouds of coloured discs over
 * the same roofs with nothing to tell them apart — the reported symptom, in
 * the operator's own words: "on ne sait pas qu'est-ce qui correspond à ce data
 * layer et qu'est-ce qui correspond à cet autre". Size and hue were already
 * spoken for. DVF spends its colour on the price against the local median and
 * DPE spends its on the official A–G scale, so neither channel was available
 * to say which register a dot belongs to. SHAPE was the only one left, and it
 * is the right one anyway: shape survives at 16 px, and it survives colour
 * blindness.
 *
 * ONE SILHOUETTE PER REGISTER, and each one is what the register is about:
 *
 *   - **€** for DVF. What a sale is. Asked for by name.
 *   - **A letter on a plate** for the ADEME DPE — the diagnostic's own label,
 *     so the marker states the grade without being clicked.
 *   - **A warning triangle** for Géorisques.
 *   - **A plan sheet** for the Géoportail de l'urbanisme: a zoning rule is a
 *     drawing about ground, not a place.
 *   - **A tower crane** for the autorisations d'urbanisme. The sheet is the
 *     rule; the crane is what turns up when someone is allowed to act on it.
 *   - **The mode's own pictogram** for IDFM stops, borrowed from
 *     `transitVehicleIcons.js` — see {@link idfmStopGlyphKind}.
 *
 * DRAWN HERE RATHER THAN VENDORED, unlike `transitVehicleIcons.js`. That
 * module records why it took Material Symbols: a bus and a tram in plan view
 * are genuinely hard to invent recognisably, and recognition beats invention.
 * None of that applies to a euro sign or a hazard triangle — they are already
 * the universal drawing — so these carry no third-party licence obligation.
 *
 * TINT-SAFE BY CONSTRUCTION, the same discipline as its two sibling icon
 * packs. No glyph carries a hue of its own: everything is white or black at
 * some alpha. Cesium multiplies `billboard.color` into the texture, so white
 * takes the layer's value colour exactly — the DVF price ramp, the official
 * DPE scale, the Géorisques severity — while black survives the multiply
 * (0 × c = 0). A hue baked into the artwork would fight the tint and destroy
 * the channel each layer spends its colour on.
 *
 * TWO WAYS TO SPEND THAT WHITE, AND THE CHOICE IS A MEASUREMENT.
 *
 *   - **Line-art over a dark halo** — the default, and right over a road map.
 *     The silhouette is the read and the halo is what keeps it off a pale
 *     roof.
 *   - **A filled pastille with the sign in dark ink** — `disc: true`. The
 *     disc is the tintable surface, so the colour channel gains ~40× the
 *     area, and the sign is punched through it in black.
 *
 * The second exists because the first was measured and lost where it had to
 * win: over Google's photoreal tileset, a 19 px euro puts roughly 7 % of its
 * box in ink, and 7 % of amber over a field of terracotta roofs is nothing.
 * `euro` carries it, and since 2026-09-21 so do the DPE letters, as a rounded
 * PLATE rather than a disc — the shape a reader knows from the label on a sale
 * listing. Both were decided the same way: by looking at the layer over
 * photoreal, not by symmetry with each other. The other kinds stay line-art.

 * WHY THE LETTERS LEFT THE LINE-ART (2026-09-21). A yellow D in line-art over
 * Lyon's roofs put a few pixels of yellow on terracotta, and a D badge and an
 * E badge were told apart by hue alone at 20 px: the reported view showed the
 * volumes lit and the badges barely there. Filled, the class colour covers the

 * and the letter is dark on every class, which the tint cannot undo (0 × c = 0).

/**
 * The seven letters of the official DPE ladder, plus the case the register
 * leaves blank — as **Inter**'s own outlines, vendored glyph by glyph.
 *
 * NOT SVG `<text>`, for the reason this module has always given: text inside an
 * SVG loaded as an IMAGE resolves against whatever font the browser happens to
 * pick, which is not a thing to bet a legend on. The outlines are extracted
 * once, at build time, so the letterforms are decided here rather than by the
 * reader's machine.
 *
 * NOT DRAWN HERE EITHER, which is the change. These used to be seven stroked
 * paths authored in this file — an even line weight, arcs where a typeface has
 * curves, and no relationship between one letter and the next beyond a shared
 * bounding box. They read as traced rather than set, and the B and the G said
 * so loudest. A letter is the one thing in this pack that is NOT a picture of
 * an object: it is a character, and characters are the work of type designers.
 * Recognition beats invention here exactly as it does for a bus.
 *
 * Inter specifically, because the application already sets its entire interface
 * in it (`--font-sans`, loaded in `index.html`). A grade badge on the globe and
 * the same grade printed on the card are now the same letterforms.
 *
 * WHAT IS STORED. Each entry is the glyph's `d` exactly as the font contains
 * it, in Inter's own 2048-unit em space, plus `cx` — the horizontal centre of
 * its bounding box, which is derived from the outline rather than imposed on
 * it. Nothing is rescaled here; {@link addressMarkerGlyph} places the outline
 * with an SVG transform, so what is stored stays verifiably the font's.
 *
 * Extracted with fontkit from `ofl/inter/Inter[opsz,wght].ttf` (google/fonts)
 * at `wght 700, opsz 14` on 2026-09-02. `opsz 14` rather than 32 on purpose:
 * Inter's optical-size axis opens the counters for small sizes, and this draws
 * at 15 px.

  //    photoreal tileset it is not, and Bayonne is the case that proved it —
  //    an amber € at 19 px puts roughly 7 % of its box in ink, and 7 % of

  //
  //    So the marker is inverted, and only for the layers that draw over the
  //    world rather than over a basemap: a FILLED disc takes the tint, and the
  //    € is punched through it in black. Three things survive the change and
  //    they are the three that matter — the colour channel is untouched and in
  //    fact gains two orders of magnitude of area, the SHAPE channel still
  //    says DVF because the € is still the thing you read, and the tint still
  //    lands exactly, because Cesium multiplies `billboard.color` into the
