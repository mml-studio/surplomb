/**
 * IGN isochrone feed projection — where you can actually get to, rather than
 * how far away things are.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS AT ALL. A circle drawn at 800 m around an address is a lie
 * told by a map: it crosses railways, rivers and motorways as if they were
 * pavement. The Géoplateforme runs Valhalla over IGN's own BD TOPO road and
 * path network and returns the polygon actually reachable in a given time —
 * the difference between "1 km away" and "eleven minutes on foot, because the
 * only bridge is upstream".
 *
 * MEASURED against the live service on 2026-09-01:
 *   - `GET data.geopf.fr/navigation/isochrone?point=LON,LAT&resource=bdtopo-valhalla
 *     &costValue=600&costType=time&profile=pedestrian`
 *     → 200, 716 bytes, `access-control-allow-origin: *`, keyless,
 *       `cache-control: private, max-age=1814400` and a strong ETag
 *   - the answer is a `Polygon`; a 600 s pedestrian ring came back with 24
 *     vertices
 *   - `resourceVersion` moved between two probes on the SAME day
 *     (`2026-08-26`, then `2026-08-25`), so it is relayed, never pinned
 *
 * THE PROFILE THE DESIGN WANTED AND THIS SOURCE DOES NOT HAVE. Only `car` and
 * `pedestrian` are accepted; `bicycle` and `truck` are rejected with HTTP 400
 * and an error that enumerates the valid set. So walking and driving rings are
 * real here and a CYCLING ring is not available from this service at all. The
 * app's existing `/api/route` proxy does carry an OSRM `bike` profile, but that
 * answers a route between two points, not a reachable area. Offering a cycling
 * isochrone would mean modelling one, and a modelled ring drawn beside two
 * measured ones is exactly the false precision the mission design forbids.
 *
 * Dependency-free and side-effect-free. The `/api/isochrone` proxy imports this.

/**
 * WHY A CYCLING RING NEEDED A DIFFERENT SOURCE ENTIRELY.
 *
 * Re-probed 2026-09-02, and the refusal has not moved: `profile=bicycle`,
 * `bike`, `cycle` and `cycling` all answer HTTP 400 from the Géoplateforme with
 * `value should be one of car,pedestrian`, on `bdtopo-valhalla` and on
 * `bdtopo-pgr` alike. BD TOPO has no cycling cost model, so there is nothing to
 * ask it for. A cycling ring therefore has to come from a network that knows
 * what a cycle track is, and in France that is OpenStreetMap.
 *
 * FOSSGIS runs the Valhalla instance that WOULD answer this in one call. It was
 * unreachable from two networks on 2026-09-02 (TCP connect timeout to
 * valhalla1.openstreetmap.de:443, twice, while DNS resolved), so it is not a
 * dependency this can rest on. Its sibling — the OSRM cluster at
 * `routing.openstreetmap.de/routed-bike` — answered in 0.6 s, and this
 * repository already routes through it for `/api/route`.
 *
 * WHAT OSRM CAN AND CANNOT GIVE. OSRM has no isochrone endpoint. It has
 * `/table`, which answers the travel time from one origin to up to ~400
 * destinations in ONE request. So the ring is measured rather than modelled —
 * every vertex is a real routed cycling duration on the OSM network — but it is
 * measured ALONG SPOKES: 36 bearings, 11 samples each, and the reachable
 * distance on each bearing is the point where the measured duration crosses the
 * budget. What is drawn between two neighbouring spokes is a straight line
 * nobody measured.
 *
 * SO IT IS AN ENVELOPE, AND IT IS LABELLED ONE. A star polygon cannot express
 * the two things the IGN polygon can: a pocket you cannot reach, and a
 * catchment in disconnected pieces. It fills them in, so its area is an UPPER
 * BOUND, never the "surface réellement atteignable" the other two rings report.
 * Measured 2026-09-02, running this exact method on the WALKING network and
 * comparing it against the IGN walking polygon at the same point:
 *
 *   Lyon Presqu'île   5/10/15 min   +1 %   +17 %   +19 %
 *   Paris 11e                       +14 %  +11 %   +14 %
 *   Bordeaux centre                 −24 %  +2 %    +9 %
 *   Ustaritz (64)                   −32 %  −12 %   +40 %
 *   Cantal, rural                   +117 % +69 %   +69 %
 *
 * The rural row is the honest worst case and the reason the label matters:
 * where the network is a handful of roads, the true shape is a spider and any
 * envelope around it is mostly ground you cannot reach. That table is printed
 * on the card, not buried here.
 *
 * The two figures also differ because the NETWORKS differ — OSM against BD
 * TOPO — and the comparison deliberately does not try to separate the two: what
 * a reader wants to know is whether the drawn shape is the right size, and that
 * is the combined question.
