# Surplomb — does the edge still rate-limit ALL of /api?
#
# The rule that stood in front of the former staging hostname is 30 requests per 10
# seconds per address on `/api`, blocking for 10 s (measured 2026-09-09). A GEV page makes
# about six `/api` calls to boot, so the page never trips it — a QA harness,
# a couple of tabs reloading, or two people behind one NAT do, and for those
# ten seconds EVERY `/api` answers 429: the mic reads "Could not reach voice
# configuration (HTTP 429)", live layers stall, proxied tiles go grey.
#
# The rule belongs on the five routes that spend a key, not on open data. The
# expression to paste in the Cloudflare dashboard is in docs/DEPLOY.md; this
# script is how you check which shape is live, before and after.
#
# RUN IT FROM THE VPS. The limit is per source address, and Claude runs on the
# owner's public IP: probing from the laptop blocks the owner's own browser for
# ten seconds, which happened three times on 2026-09-09.
#
# What it does: bursts a KEYLESS /api route that no correct rule would ever
# throttle, plus `/` as a control. It spends no API key and reads no secret —
# `/api/voice/config` behind the Basic gate answers 401, and a 401 proves the
# request reached the origin just as well as a 200 does. Only a 429 with
# Cloudflare's `error code: 1015` means the edge answered instead.
