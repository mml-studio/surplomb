/**
 * French hydro register projection — the pure half of the Centrales hydro layer.
 *
 * Lives here rather than inside the build script for the reason
 * `rteGenerationFeed.js` and `edfPlantsFeed.js` do: the shapes ODRÉ publishes
 * are strange in specific, repeatable ways, and the only thing that keeps a
 * normalisation honest across a rebuild is a test against captured rows. The
 * build script (`scripts/build-fr-hydro-registry.mjs`) imports these functions;
 * so does the browser layer, for the display half.
 *
 * ── What this register is ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * ODRÉ's *Registre national des installations de production et de stockage
 * d'électricité* is the only nationwide list of French hydro. Measured on the
 * 30/06/2026 edition: **2 757 hydraulic installations, 26,04 GW**, against the
 * 51 plants EDF Open Data publishes and the 56 the ≥ 100 MW `units.json`
 * registry carries. It is the reason the nine SHEM plants at Laruns — 223,9 MW
 * in one commune of the Pyrénées-Atlantiques — were on no layer of this globe:
 * every other French source this project reads is either EDF-only or has a
 * 100 MW floor, and Laruns is neither EDF nor above 100 MW.
 *
 * ── The trap that shapes everything here: no coordinates ────────────────────
 * **The register publishes no position.** Not a point, not a parcel — a commune
 * INSEE code and nothing else. Every marker this layer draws is therefore a
 * JOIN, and the join succeeds for some plants and fails for others. That
 * failure is not hidden: see `PLACEMENT_TIERS`.
 *
 * ── The second trap: half the register has no name ──────────────────────────
 * 1 359 of the 2 757 rows publish `nominstallation` as the literal string
 * `"Confidentiel"` — small private installations whose operator is a person,
 * anonymised by the publisher. `plantName()` returns `null` for those rather
 * than the word "Confidentiel", because "Confidentiel" is not a plant's name
 * and no card should print it as one.
 *
 * What survives anonymisation is most of the row. Measured across the 1 359:
 * commune 100 %, installed power 100 %, technology 96 %, commissioning date
 * 100 %, connection voltage 100 %, source substation 95 %, grid operator 100 %,
 * EIC code 100 %, and rolling twelve-month energy injected 90 %. An anonymous
 * plant is a full card missing one line, not an empty one.
 *
 * ── The third trap: published zeros that mean "not published" ───────────────
 * `hauteurchute`, `debitmaximal`, `productible`, `capacitereservoir` and
 * `energiestockable` are published as `0.0` on rows that simply do not declare
 * them. Measured across all 2 757 hydro rows, the share carrying a NON-ZERO
 * value is: head 24 %, annual productible 8 %, reservoir capacity 3 %, and
 * **maximum flow 0 % — the column is zero on every single row in France**. They
 * are therefore read through `positiveOrNull()`, and `debitmaximal` is not read
 * at all: a layer that showed "0 m³/s" would be asserting a stopped turbine on
 * 2 757 running plants.
 *
 * ── The fourth trap: 26 hydro plants published as photovoltaic ──────────────
 * `technologie` is `Photovoltaïque` on 26 rows whose `codefiliere` is `HYDLQ`.
 * 25 of them are in Corsica, all connected by EDF-SEI, and they are the
 * island's actual hydroelectric fleet: Rizzanese at Sainte-Lucie-de-Tallano
 * (55 MW), Lugo-di-Nazza (43 MW), Castirla (28,5 MW), Tolla, Calacuccia, Ocana,
 * Asco. 220,9 MW of hydro carrying the wrong technology in the publisher's own
 * file.
 *
 * The filière is right and the technology is wrong, so the rows are KEPT and
 * the technology is refused: `techKey` is null for any value outside the five
 * hydro technologies, while `tech` preserves the published string verbatim so
 * the anomaly stays visible in the file instead of being quietly corrected to
 * something this project made up. The same rule catches the register's own
 * `Autre` on three Tarn mills.
 *
 * ── The one measurement in the file ─────────────────────────────────────────
 * `energieannuelleglissanteinjectee` is real: the energy actually injected over
 * the trailing twelve months, in kWh, present and non-zero on 94 % of rows. It
 * is the only figure here that is an OUTPUT rather than a nameplate, which is
 * why it is carried under a name that says so and why `loadFactor()` exists —
 * 74 MW at Miégebat against 188 GWh injected is 29 %, and that ratio is the
 * single most informative thing this register can tell a reader about a plant
 * whose name it refuses to publish.
