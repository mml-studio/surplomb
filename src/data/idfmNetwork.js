/**
 * Île-de-France Mobilités — ONE layer for the Paris network: what serves this
 * stop, and how often it does.
 *
 * ── The absence this layer answers ──────────────────────────────────────────
 * `transitCoverage.js` measured it across all 148 queryable national feeds:
 * **0 live vehicles in Paris intra-muros** against 453 in Bordeaux, because
 * IDFM publishes no GTFS-Realtime vehicle positions at all. The flagship
 * live-transit layer is therefore blank over the one city this fork opens on,
 * and blank is indistinguishable from broken.
 *
 * What IDFM does publish, keylessly and completely, is the OFFER, and it
 * publishes it twice:
 *
 *   - `arrets` / `referentiel-des-lignes` — 37 956 stops and 2 121 lines, each
 *     line with its official livery, ODbL 1.0. This says WHAT serves a stop:
 *     the mode, the fare zone, whether the platform is step-free.
 *   - `offre_hebdomadaire_moyenne_hors_vacances` — 1 311 578 rows of average
 *     courses per stop, per line and per one-hour band over a typical
 *     term-time week, Licence Ouverte v2.0. This says HOW MUCH, and it is the
 *     only time-of-day dimension on this globe.
 *
 * ── Why these are ONE row and not two ───────────────────────────────────────
 * They were two rows until 2026-09-10, and the case for the split was written
 * at length: two licences, a rate is not a referential, neither set contains
 * the other, and the query gates differ by 12× in payload. Every one of those
 * is true and none of them is a reason to make the READER do the join. Two
 * chips drew ONE subject — measured 2026-09-02 against the referential,
 * **34 903 of the frequency file's 36 502 stops (95.6 %) join on `arrets.arrid`**
 * — and the reader who wanted "how good is the transport at this address" had
 * to know to press both. The differences survive as facts rather than as
 * chips: the card says when a stop publishes no profile, `dataCredits.js`
 * names both licences for as long as the row is on, and the frequency half
 * simply stops DRAWING above its own gate rather than dragging the referential
 * up with it — a click is still answered at any altitude, see
 * {@link probeStop}.
 *
 * What did NOT survive is the département choropleth the frequency row painted
 * above that gate. Eight polygons carrying a per-stop mean, at an alpha that
 * had to stay low enough for satellite imagery underneath — it read as a faint
 * wash over half of France and answered a question nobody had asked at that
 * altitude. The stop-level product is the product.
 *
 * ── ONE MARK PER STOP, which took two goes to get right ────────────────────
 * A stop could carry two marks on one coordinate — the mode's pictogram, and a
 * rate disc under it — and the first version of this merge kept both, sized so
 * that the disc "sits INSIDE the mode glyph rather than fighting it". The
 * reader who saw it said the plain thing: they are one subject drawn twice, and
 * the two numbers are joined anyway. They were right, and the argument for the
 * stack was an argument about pixels rather than about what is being said.
 *
 * So one point carries one mark, and the fix ran in both directions:
 *
 *  • THE PICTOGRAM BECAME A BADGE and grew, 14–24 px to 21–27 px. Naked white
 *    line-art tinted `#c9d4e0` over photorealistic Paris is grey on grey and
 *    the most numerous mode wore it. See {@link stopBadge}.
 *  • THE BADGE CARRIES THE RATE IN ITS FILL, so nothing was lost by dropping
 *    the disc: mode is the shape, rate is the colour, and the legend swaps to
 *    match whichever the view has actually read. See {@link stopBadgeFill}.
 *  • THE DISC YIELDS wherever a badge stands, and only there — never
 *    everywhere. The two publications are read with different page sizes,
 *    {@link STOP_LIMIT} against {@link IDFM_FREQ_MAX_STOPS}, so in a dense
 *    viewport most discs have no badge over them and stay drawn. See
 *    {@link restoreDiscStyle}.
 *
 * The discs' own size ladder still answers to density, and that is why the
 * badges do not have to. Measured over the 805 stops in the 4 km Châtelet box,
 * 2026-09-02: median nearest-neighbour distance **24.2 m**, p10 8.9 m, **463
 * stops with a neighbour inside 30 m** — which is what caps a disc at 13 px.
 * At most {@link STOP_LIMIT} badges are ever on screen, at any altitude,
 * because a hundred is all one referential query asks for.
 *
 * ── Two queries, two gates, one row ─────────────────────────────────────────
 * THE REFERENTIAL is a viewport box: the stops API takes a bounding box, so
 * the viewport IS the natural query. It draws below {@link ACTIVATION_ALTITUDE_M}.
 *
 * THE FREQUENCY is a tighter viewport box, because its rows are 24 per stop
 * and `offset + limit <= 20000` is a hard cap under `group_by`: five upstream
 * calls buy at most {@link IDFM_FREQ_MAX_STOPS} full profiles. It draws below
 * {@link STOPS_ENTER_SPAN_DEG} of view span and leaves above
 * {@link STOPS_EXIT_SPAN_DEG}, with hysteresis so a wheel notch cannot flip it.
 *
 * THE GATE BOUNDS THE DRAWING AND NOT THE ANSWER. Above it the badges name
 * their mode and no rate is drawn — but a click names one coordinate, and the
 * cheapest legal box around one coordinate is one grid cell, so the click buys
 * it. A card that answered "not at this altitude" was quoting the map's
 * ceiling at somebody who had already stopped asking about the map. See
 * {@link probeStop}.
 *
 * ── The clock is Paris's, and the day runs 04:00 → 03:59 ────────────────────
 * The default moment is `Europe/Paris` NOW, mapped onto the operating day by
 * `operatingSlot()`: 01:30 on a Wednesday is TUESDAY's band 25, and getting
 * that backwards moves every night reading onto the wrong day. Friday night is
 * where it costs most — band 25 is 15 904 courses region-wide on a Monday and
 * **31 585 on a Friday, +98.6 %**.
 *
 * ── Silence is measured, so it is NOT grey ──────────────────────────────────
 * `fraicheurParis.js` established the rule: grey `#8a93a6` means "the register
 * did not measure this" and nothing else. A stop that publishes a profile and
 * has no course in the selected band WAS measured, and the published answer is
 * zero. It keeps its own dark colour, its own legend row, its own card line,
 * and it is DRAWN. The grey is not unused, though: a referential stop with NO
 * row in the offer file is exactly what it is for, and in a charted view its
 * badge wears it — see {@link IDFM_NOT_MEASURED_COLOR}.
 *

 * The mark a stop is drawn with: its MODE's pictogram inside a filled badge.

 * than inventing a second transit vocabulary for the same city.
 *
 * ── The bare pictogram was unreadable, and not by a little ────────────────
 * Until 2026-09-10 this layer drew that glyph naked: white line-art with
 * a ~1.6 px dark halo, 14 px wide for a bus, tinted `#c9d4e0`. Bus is the
 * mode this referential is mostly made of. Over photorealistic Paris that is
 * pale grey line-art on pale grey roofs and pale grey roads, and the reader
 * who reported it used the words "gris sur gris". A filled badge answers it by
 * construction instead of by hunting for a luckier hue: the mark brings its
 * own ground, and `transitVehicleIcons.js` picks the ink from the fill's
 * luminance so the pictogram survives either end of a lightness ramp.
 *
 * ── One mark per stop, which is what the fill is FOR ──────────────────────
 * A stop used to be able to carry two marks on one coordinate — this pictogram
 * and a rate disc under it — and the reader who saw both said the obvious
 * thing: they are one subject drawn twice. So the disc now yields wherever a
 * badge stands (see {@link reconcileDiscs}) and the badge carries the rate in
 * its FILL. That is why the fill is a parameter and not a property of the
 * mode: at a hundred badges on screen the fill is the only channel wide enough
 * to read at a glance, and the mode is already carried by the shape inside it.
 *
 * @param {?string} mode
 * @param {string} fill Badge fill, from {@link stopBadgeFill}.

 *  • ANY STOP IN A VIEW THAT CHARTED NOTHING takes its mode's hue. Above the

 * a count of published time bands. A reader called it « du charabia ». It is
 * seven lines now, and it opens on how long they stand at the pole.
 *
 * Three lines were cut outright and the reasoning is worth keeping:
 *   - `Total Mardi : 244 courses` measures how big the stop is, which is a
 *     fact about the operator's day, not about the reader's.
 *   - `Même tranche : Lun 13 · Mar 13 · …` is seven numbers with no question
 *     attached. {@link mostDifferentDay} asks the question and answers it in
 *     one clause.
 *   - `21 tranches publiées sur 24` is internal accounting. The part a reader
 *     needs — when the service starts and stops — is already the first/last
 *     line, and states it in hours rather than in array indices.
 *
 * The MODE moves to the title, beside the name, where a reader looks for what
 * kind of thing they just clicked; {@link networkLine} keeps WHERE it is.
 *
 * ── A CLICK IS ANSWERED, NEVER DEFERRED ──────────────────────────────────
 * There are no altitude excuses on this card any more. It carried two —
 * "l'offre horaire n'est pas lue à cette altitude, rapprochez-vous" above the
 * frequency gate, and a flat "aucun profil publié" in a box the proxy had
 * refused without ever asking about this stop — and both were the MAP's
 * ceiling quoted back at a reader who had already narrowed the question to one
 * coordinate. `probeStop()` buys that coordinate's profile instead, so the
 * only absence this card can still report is a measured one: a stop with no
 * row in the offer file. See {@link selectStop}.

 * attribution surface for as long as the layer is on, and the layer's own
 * `source` string. A per-stop card is not one of those places — it is where a

 * stands, but a hidden disc still has to be in the right place — its badge can
 * go at any repaint, and a fix that seated one of the two would simply pull
 * them apart at that moment.
 *
 * The same mechanism the address-scan factory runs, for the same reason: a
 * stop drawn on the ellipsoid stands eighty metres under the pavement it
 * serves, and a vertical error under a camera that is not exactly overhead is
 * a horizontal error on screen that MOVES as the camera moves. Measured on
 * this layer, 2026-09-10 over the Latin Quarter with the camera at 420 m: the
 * marks sat at ellipsoidal 0 while the rendered mesh read 83.5 to 91.6 m under
 * the same coordinates — 140 px of median error, 272 px at worst, and up to
 * 269 px of SLIDE across a 250 m pan. That slide is the reported symptom.
 *
 * The height is read from whichever surface is ON SCREEN, which is the part
 * that was missing: `globe.getHeight()` answers `undefined` for every point on
 * the photoreal stack, where the globe is hidden, so this seating was a silent
 * no-op on the stack most readers are looking at. `renderedSurface.js` owns
 * that decision and the budget it costs.
 *
 * This layer keeps its own copy of the wiring rather than the logic — its scan
 * is a bounding box, not a radius, so it does not sit on the factory — and the
 * box centre stands in for surface that has not streamed in yet. Over this
 * viewport that one borrowed reading is most of the fix on its own: ~88 m of
 * error down to ~8 m, for a single probe.

 * function that actually builds it. `refStops` is the projected `arrets` rows
 * the referential half holds, keyed on `arrid` here as it is there.
