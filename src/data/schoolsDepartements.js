 *
 * The national regime: 68 158 open, geolocated establishments folded onto the
 * 96 bundled département polygons, so the layer says something true at
 * national altitude instead of drawing a smear.
 *
 * ── Why this sweep is one call, where the charge-point one is a recursion ───
 * `irveDepartements.js` has to sweep ODRÉ in latitude stripes and split any
 * stripe that comes back at the aggregation limit, because it needs a GROUPED
 * query and Opendatasoft caps those silently. This register does not: its
 * `/exports/` endpoint streams every matching row with no aggregation and no
 * cap, and the whole national set — filtered to open and geolocated, a
 * handful of columns wide — is **8.5 MB, 2.4 MB gzipped, in one request**
 * (measured). So
 * the sweep here is a single GET, the truncation recursion does not exist, and
 * the completeness proof is a straight comparison against the portal's own
 * `total_count` for the same `where`.
 *
 * ── The coordinate is the join, never the code ─────────────────────────────
 * The register publishes `code_departement` and it CANNOT be joined to the
 * bundled polygons: the register zero-pads to three characters (`028`, `045`)
 * and spells Corsica `02A` / `02B`, where the IGN outlines use `28`, `45`,
 * `2A`, `2B`. Every row would miss. Assignment is therefore point-in-polygon,
 * exactly as the charge-point rollup does it, which is also what makes the
 * result independent of a code convention either side might change.
 *
 * ── What the 96 polygons cannot hold ────────────────────────────────────────
 * They are METROPOLITAN. The bundled file has 96 features and no overseas
 * geometry at all, so **2 762 of 68 158 open, geolocated establishments fall
 * outside every polygon** — measured by running this projection over the real
 * national export. 2 753 of them are the overseas collectivités: La Réunion
 * 855, Guadeloupe 448, Martinique 403, Nouvelle-Calédonie 334, Mayotte 333,
 * Guyane 319, Saint-Martin 38, Saint-Pierre-et-Miquelon 14, Saint-Barthélemy 9.
 *
 * The other 9 are metropolitan and are a different fact: schools on Belle-Île,
 * Ouessant, Sein and Bréhat, islands the simplified outlines drop entirely, so
 * they sit further from the drawn coast than the 2 km snap reaches. Both kinds
 * are reported the same way rather than being averaged into one number.
 *
 * They are not silently dropped and they are not snapped — the nearest French
 * polygon to a school in Cayenne is 7 000 km away. They are counted, named by
 * their published `code_departement`, and returned as `offshore` so the layer
 * can state the shortfall on the national card. A choropleth that quietly
 * omits them is a choropleth claiming France has 65 396 schools.
 *
 * ── What the 2 km coastal snap is for, and what it is not ──────────────────
 * A handful of genuinely metropolitan schools land just outside the simplified
 * outlines — the IGN shapes bundled here are ~14 000 vertices for all of
 * France, so a seafront lycée in Antibes can sit in the drawn sea. Those snap
 * to the nearest polygon within 2 km and are counted in `snapped`, because
 * moving a point is a thing the map did rather than a thing the file said. The
 * measurement behind the 2 km is in `irveDepartements.js`, where it was made.
 * It cannot reach the overseas collectivities, which is the point.
 *
 * ── What this rollup is read as, and what changed ───────────────────────────
 * This header used to argue which single variable the national FILL was binned
 * on, and answered "the number of ESTABLISHMENTS, not pupils, because the
 * layer draws establishments". The premise was the defect: painting a raw
 * count as a colour fill is the fault CARTOGRAPHY B1 names in capitals, and
 * the question "count or density?" only exists while there is one channel to
 * put them on. `schoolsFrance.js` now draws a PRISM, so both travel:
 *
 *   `schools`      the absolute count → the prism's HEIGHT.
 *   `per1000Km2`   the count per 1 000 km² of the polygon actually drawn → the
 *                  prism's COLOUR. It was already computed here and, until the
 *                  prism, was only ever printed on a card.
 *
 * Measured on the 2026-09-03 export (68 158 rows) through this very function:
 * counts run 150 (Lozère) → 2 504 (Nord), median 577, range 1 : 16.7; density
 * runs 29.0 → 14 303 per 1 000 km², median 92.4, range 1 : 493. The two ranges
 * differ by a factor of thirty, which is the arithmetic reason one channel
 * could never carry both.
 *
 * `bin` and `thresholds` — the six-quantile ladder of the old fill — are still
 * computed and still returned, and NOTHING PAINTS THEM any more. They stay
 * because the payload shape is shared with the day-long disk cache and pinned
 * by `schoolsDepartements.test.mjs`, and because they remain the cheapest read
 * of the count distribution in a served document; removing them is a follow-up
 * that has to land with that test file. Treat them as a diagnostic, never as a
 * rendering instruction: a quantile ladder recomputed from the rows in hand is
 * exactly the C1 violation the prism's frozen domain exists to remove.
 *
 * `per1000Km2` is `null`, never 0, when the drawn polygon has no area: a
 * density that could not be computed is not a density of zero (A1). A
 * département with no establishments in it keeps a real 0 — that is a
 * measurement, and the prism draws it as one.
 *
 * Dependency-free and side-effect-free (no Cesium, no DOM) so it runs
 * identically in the browser, in the Vite dev-server proxy, and under
 * `node --test`.
