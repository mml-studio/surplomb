/**
 * Deterministic browser proof that the aircraft-noise layer is READABLE FROM
 * A DEZOOMED CAMERA.
 *
 * THE DEFECT THIS HARNESS EXISTS TO CATCH. A PEB is a set of nested rings, a
 * WMS GetFeatureInfo answers within a few pixels of the coordinate it is given,
 * and the reference point of an aerodrome sits inside zone A. So a point probe
 * returns ONE band — the innermost — and zones B, C and D, the ones anybody
 * dezooming has come to look at, are never asked for. On top of that the layer
 * shared the address-scan ceiling of 12 km and cleared itself above it, while
 * the widest plan in France (Le Bourget's zone D) is 65.8 km across. The shape
 * could not be on screen whole at any altitude the layer would answer at.
 *
 * None of that is visible to a unit test: the projection is correct, the
 * fixtures are real, the payload validates. It is a fact about what reaches the
 * screen at a given camera height, so it needs a camera.
 *
 * The checks, over Roissy — the aerodrome whose zone D only a coarse probe
 * returns and whose plan is the largest in the register:
 *
 *   i.   at 6 km the layer is in POINT mode: one probe, the fine scale, and
 *        the winner rule intact. Nothing about the overview may regress this.
 *   ii.  at 60 km it is NOT dormant and NOT cleared — the failure this whole
 *        change is about — and it draws strictly MORE bands than the point
 *        scan did, because it is now asking a wider question.
 *   iii. Roissy's four bands A, B, C and D are all on screen at once, from a
 *        camera that can see the whole 41 km of zone C.
 *   iv.  every one of those bands is drawn SOLID. The dash is the point-mode
 *        channel for "the service found this near your pixel"; there is no
 *        pixel, and a dashed ring would answer a question nobody asked.
 *   v.   several aerodromes are drawn at once, each with its own marker, and
 *        clicking one opens ITS card and not another's.
 *   vi.  the card names the scale the SHAPE BESIDE IT is at. The overview is
 *        served at a scale a hundred times coarser than a point scan's and each
 *        band is then re-fetched at the fine scale behind the response, so both
 *        denominators are legitimate and which one is true depends on how far
 *        the second pass has got. What must never happen — and is what this
 *        checks — is the card claiming a precision the outline does not have.
 *   vii. at 400 km, above the overview ceiling, it goes dormant and clears, so
 *        the old honest behaviour survives at the altitude it now belongs at.
 *
 * Screenshots are written under the gitignored `qa-shots/bruit-overview/`.
