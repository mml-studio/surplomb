// src/data/dpeSites.js — the DPE register, grouped by the thing a map can
// actually point at.
//
// ── The measurement this file exists for ───────────────────────────────────
//
// A default scan of Paris 13e (2.3760, 48.8300, 200 m) serves 200 diagnostics
// out of 917. Those 200 rows carry **14 distinct coordinates**, 13 distinct
// BAN addresses and **5 distinct RNB identifiers**. One coordinate carries
// **42** of them.
//
// So the layer drew 200 billboards on 14 pixels. Only the topmost of each pile
// was ever visible or clickable; the other 186 were an atlas entry, a draw
// call and a card lottery each. And the reported symptom was not "there are
// too many badges" — it was «on ne comprend pas où est le bien», which is
// exactly right: a stack of letters on a street geocode says a diagnostic
// exists somewhere near here, and nothing more.
//
// It also broke the SEATING, which is the other half of the same report. Marks
// are lifted onto the drawn surface by `renderedSurface.js` under a budget of
// 24 probes per pass over six passes — 144 marks. 200 badges never fit, so
// dozens stayed on the scan-centre fallback height, and a mark at the wrong
// height under a camera that is not exactly overhead is a mark that SLIDES
// when the camera turns. Measured before this change, 1400 × 900, nadir at
// 420 m: 25.2 m of worst height error, 25.5 px of worst screen offset, and up
// to **72.6 px of slide across a 250 m pan**.
//
// Grouping fixes both at once, and the second one for free.
//
// ── What a site IS ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// A DPE describes ONE DWELLING. A map cannot draw a dwelling: the register
// publishes no coordinate for a flat, and the envelope and the heating plant a
// diagnostic grades are shared by the whole block anyway. What a map CAN draw
// is the building, and the register names it — `id_rnb`, on 34.5 % to 73.7 %
// of the rows depending on the commune (see `rnbPivot.js`).
//
// So a site is, in order of preference:
//
//   1. **A BUILDING** — every diagnostic carrying the same `id_rnb`. The
//      register's own claim, not a guess.
//   2. **AN ADDRESS** — every diagnostic sharing a BAN key, when none of them
//      names a building. The geocode is a point on a street and the card says
//      so.
//   3. **A COORDINATE** — the fallback for a row with neither, which is the
//      shape `projectDpe` can still emit for an edition missing both columns.
//
// ── The propagation, and its one refusal ───────────────────────────────────
//
// A BAN address whose rows DISAGREE about nothing — where the rows that name a
// building all name the SAME one — lends that identifier to its rows that name
// none. This is not an inference about geography; it is the statement that two
// diagnostics at `93 rue du Chevaleret` are in the building at 93 rue du
// Chevaleret. Measured on the box above: 111 rows carry an identifier, 135
// after propagation, 8 of the 13 addresses fully resolved.
//
// Where an address carries TWO identifiers it is refused whole. Those are the
// real cases the rule must not paper over — a courtyard building behind a
// street one, a block split across two RNB records — and lending either id to
// the undecided rows would paint a diagnostic onto a building chosen by
// whichever row the register happened to return first.
//
// Everything here is pure and node-testable; the Cesium drawing lives in
// `dpeFrance.js` and the upstream resolution in the `/api/dpe` proxy.
