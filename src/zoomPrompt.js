/**
 * @module zoomPrompt
 *
 * "Zoome pour voir cette couche" — said in the middle of the screen, where the
 * eye already is.
 *
 * Thirteen layers refuse to draw above a ceiling of their own, and every one of
 * them says so honestly: `powerGrid` publishes a guidance status and a sentence,
 * the manager prints that sentence under the row, and `layerFeedState()` takes
 * care that the chip stays green because a zoom gate is not a fault. All of that
 * is correct and none of it is SEEN. The sentence lands in a sub-line, in small
 * type, in a panel that can be collapsed to a 0×0 box — while the reader is
 * looking at a globe 1 000 km below, wondering why the layer they just switched
 * on drew nothing.
 *
 * So this module states it once, centrally, and — for the three layers that can
 * — offers to do it: `ensureViewGate()` already solves the view that fits under
 * a layer's ceiling and flies there (`data/viewGate.js`). Until now nothing in
 * the app called it.
 *
 * ── What it is careful about ────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * • **It speaks for SWITCHED-ON layers only.** Thirteen layers are gated; at a
 *   continental camera twelve of them are outside their gate at the same time.
 *   A card that listed every layer that COULD be waiting would be a wall, and
 *   would be nagging about layers nobody asked for. A gate is only news for a
 *   layer the reader has turned on and is waiting for.
 *
 * • **It borrows the layer's own words.** The message is the layer's
 *   `loadingLabel` — the same string the panel row prints, never a second
 *   sentence written here that could drift from it. A layer that publishes no
 *   sentence gets a neutral fallback rather than an invented ceiling.
 *
 * • **It aggregates.** One card, up to three rows, then "+N more". Three
 *   cards stacked in the middle of a globe is a modal dialog by accident.
 *
 * • **It is not a first-run card.** Dismissal is remembered against the SET of
 *   waiting layers (the signature), not forever: closing it while the grid
 *   waits keeps it closed for that situation, and a different set of layers
 *   waiting later is different news.
