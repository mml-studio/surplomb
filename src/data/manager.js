   * WHY HERE AND NOWHERE ELSE (CARTOGRAPHY, "a map without a key is a

   * `#data-panel`, which ships `collapsed` — and the collapsed rule hides

   * (`ui.js`, `allowStored: !this._initialShareState`), so the one moment
   * somebody reads a map they did not build was the moment the key was
   * structurally guaranteed absent. That copy is gone: the row keeps the
   * chips, which are controls, and the key is painted once, here.
   *
   * The `blurb` is rendered as TEXT here, not as a `title` tooltip. Those
   * strings carry statements the map has to make — "the fill is an absolute
   * count, so the card also gives the rate per 1 000 km²" — and a tooltip puts
   * them out of reach of anyone without a mouse.
   *
   * ── TWO TIERS, AND ONLY WHERE THERE IS SOMETHING TO DISAMBIGUATE ──────────
   *
   * The key used to have exactly one tier: one enabled layer, one titled block.
   * The PANEL has had two since the fusion table — one row, several chips — and
   * the mismatch is what made « Trafic routier » unreadable. Measured in
   * Île-de-France at 1440×900 on 2026-09-10, one panel row printed THREE blocks
   * with identical titling (`TRAFIC ROUTIER`, `ÉVÉNEMENTS ROUTIERS`,
   * `COMPTAGES ROUTIERS` — same weight, same colour, same trailing word), 23
   * rows, 559 words and 1 256 px of content into a 216 px window. Nothing said
   * the three were one row, and nothing said they were three different
   * questions.
   *
   * So the key is grouped by PANEL ROW, and a row that has more than one member
   * on screen prints its name once and then one sub-block per member, indented
   * behind a rule. The sub-title is the member's CHIP LABEL — the word the
   * reader pressed — and not its taxonomy label, which for a companion appears
   * nowhere in the panel.
   *
   * A row with ONE member keeps today's rendering exactly: that member's own
   * name, no tier, no rule. This is deliberate and it is not laziness. `bruit-fr`
   * alone under the `local-airports` row would otherwise be titled `Aéroports`
   * over a list of PEB noise bands, which is worse than what it replaced — and
   * six of the fifteen fusions, plus every unfused layer, are in that case.
   * Chrome that disambiguates nothing is chrome that costs pixels.
   *
   * `legendNote` is the block's own sentence — its provenance and its CLOCK —
   * printed once under the sub-title instead of once per row. Four blocks land
   * on the road row and they run on four different clocks; E1 is P0 and the
   * per-row copies it replaces were, on `road-status-fr`, five English
