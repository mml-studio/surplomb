 * Shared shell for the point-centred French address layers.
 *
 * WHY THESE LAYERS ARE NOT VIEWPORT LAYERS. Géorisques, DVF, the ADEME DPE
 * register, the Géoportail de l'urbanisme, the IDFM network and the ADS permit
 * registers all answer a question about a POINT — "what reaches this address"
 * — and every one of their APIs takes a coordinate and a radius, not a
 * bounding box. The permits go further and are published per COMMUNE, which a
 * box cannot even name. Fitting them to the viewport would mean inventing a
 * centre anyway, so the centre is made explicit: each layer scans around the
 * ground point the camera is looking at, and refetches when that point moves
 * far enough to change the answer.
 *
 * WHY THERE IS A SHARED FACTORY AT ALL, against the one-self-contained-module
 * convention. The layers differ only in their endpoint and in how they draw;
 * the camera-centre derivation, the altitude gate, the movement threshold, the
 * abort handling and the error reporting are identical, and six copies of that
 * would be six places for the same bug. Each layer is
 * still one module with one default export implementing the manager's
 * interface — this file is a helper they share, like `worldOverlay.js`.
 *
 * THE CENTRE IS THE LOOK-AT POINT, NOT THE NADIR. Reusing
 * `deriveFetchCenter()` from the traffic layer, which exists because
 * `computeViewRectangle()` spans toward the horizon at oblique pitch: centring
 * on the rectangle midpoint put fetches tens of kilometres from what the user
 * was actually looking at. An address scan centred on the wrong block is worse
 * than no scan, because it looks like an answer.

 * WHY `moveEnd` IS NOT ENOUGH, though the shell already repaints on it. Both
 * the panel watcher and these layers listen to the same camera event, and the

 * nothing at all; these follow that. Depth testing is disabled instead, which
 * is what actually keeps a marker from being swallowed by the ground.
 */

/**
 * WHY THE MARKERS ARE SEATED ON THE TERRAIN BY HAND.
 *
 * Not clamping is only half an answer. `Cartesian3.fromDegrees(lon, lat)` puts
 * a marker on the ELLIPSOID, at height 0 — and the globe draws avenue de
 * France at 79 to 83 m of ellipsoidal height. The marker is eighty metres
 * under the street it describes, and because depth testing is disabled it is
 * still painted, just in the wrong place. Measured in the running app at 700 m
 * and a pitch of −35°: a DVF dot landed 83 px below its own address, and
 * turning the camera 35° moved the error to 62 px sideways.
 *
 * That is the whole of the reported symptom — "the dots aren't fixed, they
 * move when I nudge the map". A parallax error is not a constant offset; it is
 * a function of the camera pose, so the dots slide over the city instead of
 * sticking to it, and no amount of squinting at the data explains it.
 *
 * The height is therefore read rather than assumed — and read from whichever
 * surface is on screen. `renderedSurface.js` owns that question and records why
 * it had to: `globe.getHeight()` is the right call on a globe stack and answers
 * `undefined` for every point on the PHOTOREAL one, where the globe is hidden.
 * The seating below was a no-op on the default stack until 2026-09-10 —
 * measured at 83 to 92 m of error over the Latin Quarter, up to 272 px on
 * screen. Markers are re-seated when the surface finishes streaming and when
 * the camera settles, because the LOD under a point refines as you fly toward
 * it.

 * ceiling the densest of these layers draws — that is the budget half. The
 * other half is the TILESET: nothing may be probed until it reports
 * `tilesLoaded`, and a first fixed-interval cut of this loop (six x 250 ms,
 * 1.5 s) expired before the photoreal stack had finished streaming and left
 * every mark on the ellipsoid — the exact bug it was written to fix, measured

 * than open-ended because a box the tileset never answers for (mid-air,

 *
 * `ground` is the answer that matters here, and it exists because THE GROUND
 * IS NOT A BACKGROUND. For a layer that describes a plot — what may be built
 * on it, what the state has encumbered it with — the plot IS the subject, and
 * requiring the operator to find the one marker the scan happened to plant is
 * asking them to click the legend instead of the map. So a click that lands on
 * the world, or on this layer's OWN wash and outlines, is a question about
 * that spot.
 *
 * A click on ANOTHER layer's object is not. That object is about to open a
 * card of its own, and two cards for one click is how a sibling layer's
 * selection gets silently talked over.
 *
 * ── `world`, AND WHY IT IS NOT `picked` ANY MORE ─────────────────────────
 * This function used to take the raw pick and read its PRESENCE: an empty
 * `scene.pick` meant the reader had clicked the map, because the bare globe is
 * not a primitive and answers nothing. The photorealistic surface ended that.
 * Measured 2026-09-10 over Paris at 700 m, six probes across the screen
 * returned six non-falsy picks — 3D Tiles features, every one — so `!picked`
 * was false everywhere a reader could click, and BOTH of this rule's map-facing
 * outcomes went dead with it:
 *
 *  • `ground` never fired, so on `urbanisme-gpu`, `bruit-fr` and
 *    `isochrone-rings` — the three layers that pass a `groundCard` or a
 *    `groundClick` — clicking the plot did nothing at all. That is the
 *    feature this paragraph opens by justifying.
 *  • `dismiss` never fired, so a card on any of the seven layers built on this
 *    factory could not be closed by clicking the map.
 *
 * The caller now decides the question the presence of a pick was standing in
 * for — "could ANYBODY select this?" — with `pickRegistry.isWorldPick`, which
 * is true for the empty pick and for a tile feature alike because neither
 * carries a pick id. A statement about ownership rather than about which
 * surface happens to be switched on.
 *
 * A foreign pick still resolves to `ignore` rather than `dismiss`, unchanged:
 * that decision is about not talking over a sibling's card, and the
 * photorealistic globe has nothing to say about it.
 *

 *   => Record<string, string>} [config.params]
 *   Extra query parameters. Takes the viewer as well as the point because a
 *   layer may ask a different question depending on the CAMERA — the urbanism
 *   layer asks for a box close in and a point higher up — and the runtime
 *   parameters because a layer may ask a different question because the READER
 *   said so; see `config.runtimeParams`.
 * @param {Record<string, {values: string[], defaultValue: string}>} [config.runtimeParams]
 *   The parameters this layer accepts through `setLayerParams`, and the closed
 *   set of values each one takes.
 *
 *   ENUMERATED, NEVER FREE. Everything reachable here is also reachable from a
 *   share link, so an unvalidated parameter is a stranger's URL choosing what
 *   this browser asks an upstream API for. A closed list means a hostile or
 *   simply stale value is REJECTED — `setParams` returns false, the manager
 *   reports `ParamsRejected`, and the layer keeps the question it was already
 *   asking — rather than clamped into something plausible.
 * @param {string[]} [config.drawOnlyParams]
 *   The subset of `runtimeParams` that changes the DRAWING and not the
 *   QUESTION — a filter over rows the proxy has already served.
 *
 *   A parameter listed here must be absent from `config.params`, or the two
 *   halves fight: the query string would move, `runScan` would refetch, and
 *   this would be a slower way of doing what it exists to avoid. When every
 *   key a `setParams` call changed is in this list, the layer rebuilds its
 *   entities from the payload in hand — no request, no rate-limit slot, no
 *   round trip between a chip press and the map answering it.
 *
 *   It is also the honest reading of what happened: the reader did not ask the
 *   register a different question, they asked to be shown less of the answer.
 *   Rescanning would re-download an identical reply to draw a subset of it.
 * @param {(runtime: Record<string, string>, summary: ?object) => object} [config.rowControls]
 *   Chips for this layer's row in the panel, built from the runtime params in
 *   force and the current summary. The manager turns a click into
 *   `setLayerParams`, so a chip's `params` must be values `runtimeParams`
 *   accepts — the two are one mechanism seen from its two ends.
 * @param {number|(() => number)} [config.maxAltitudeM] Ceiling above which a
 *   camera-following scan goes dormant. A FUNCTION when the ceiling depends on
 *   what the layer is currently asking for — a fifteen-minute drive is two
 *   orders of magnitude bigger on the ground than a five-minute walk, and one
 *   constant for both either wastes requests or hides the answer.
 * @param {number|(() => number)} [config.minShiftKm] Distance the scan centre
 *   must move before the question is asked again. Also a function for the same
 *   reason: 250 m redraws a walking ring and is noise against a driving one.
 * @param {(context: {payload: object, point: object, viewer: ?object,
 *   selectCard: (id: string) => boolean, rescan: () => void}) => void}
 *   [config.afterDraw]
 *   Called once the draw is on screen AND indexed, which is the first moment a
 *   card can be opened for it. This is where a layer that answers about a point
 *   the reader chose puts the answer up without waiting to be asked twice.
 *   `rescan` re-asks the SAME question and takes the answer anyway, bypassing
 *   both movement and query-string guards — for the layer whose upstream
 *   improves a reply it has already sent. Call it from a timer, not in a loop:
 *   nothing here rate-limits it.
 * @param {(card: object) => ({lon: number, lat: number, placement?: string}|null)}
 *   [config.cardAnchor]
 *   Move the open card off its marker. A layer that draws a SHAPE around its
 *   marker — a catchment, a viewshed — has a card that covers the very thing it
 *   describes, and only the layer knows where the shape ends. Returning null,
 *   which is the default, leaves the card on the marker.
 * @param {(context: {lon: number, lat: number, viewer: ?object}) => boolean}
 *   [config.groundClick]
 *   What this layer does with a click on bare ground that opened no card.
 *   Returning true consumes the click. Called even while the layer is DORMANT,
 *   which is the whole point for a layer whose click PINS the scan centre: the
 *   reader is up too high to scan and is asking to scan here anyway.
 * @param {() => void} [config.onClear]
 *   Called every time the shell takes its own draw down — before a redraw,
 *   when the layer goes dormant above its ceiling, and on destroy. For a layer
 *   that draws PRIMITIVES as well as entities: the shell empties the data
 *   source it owns, and only the layer knows what else it put on the globe.
 *   Without it, a layer gone dormant at 12 km would leave its ground washes
 *   standing over the country with no answer behind them.
 * @param {(pickedId: string) => boolean} [config.ownsPick]
 *   Whether a pick id that is NOT an entity of this layer's data source is
 *   still this layer's — the ids a layer gives the geometry instances of its
 *   own primitives. Such a pick then reads as a click on the layer's own
 *   ground, exactly like a click on one of its washes, and reaches
 *   `groundCard`; without it the click met an id nobody claimed and was
 *   ignored.
 * @param {(card: ?object) => void} [config.onSelectionChange]
 *   Called when the open card changes — a marker or a bare point selected
 *   (`card`), or the selection dismissed (`null`). For a layer that shows the
 *   selection somewhere other than on the card: a highlight on the ground, a
 *   section of the map key. The shell then announces a draw change, so the key
 *   repaints from the state the hook just wrote.
 * @param {(card: object) => (boolean|string)} [config.compactCard]
 *   Whether the card on the globe keeps only its title, because the layer
 *   prints the details elsewhere. Asked each time the card is painted, so a
 *   layer can answer from the page as it is at that moment — the map key
 *   folded away or not. A STRING answers yes and replaces the title too: the
 *   DPE tags its site `C–E · 16`, which says on the map what the key says in
 *   full.
 * @param {(entities: Array<object>, context: {viewer: object}) => boolean} [config.clusterClick]
 *   What a click on one of this layer's Cesium CLUSTERS does. A cluster's pick
 *   id is the array of entities it stands for, which no card is filed under,
 *   so without this hook the click is ignored. Returning true consumes it.
 * @param {() => void} [config.onSeat]
 *   Called when a seating pass has moved markers. For a layer that clusters
 *   them: Cesium re-clusters on camera moves, and a cluster placed before the
 *   marker was lifted onto the surface would hang where the marker used to be.
 * @param {typeof fetch} [config.fetchImpl] Injection seam for tests.
 * @returns {object} A layer module.
