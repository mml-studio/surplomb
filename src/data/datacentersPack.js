/*
 * DATACENTERS PACK — what the bundled snapshots can honestly say.
 *
 * The pack is now TWO databases under one ODbL licence: the OpenStreetMap
 * extract this file was written for, and — in France only — the megawatts
 * OpenStreetMap does not have. See "THE POWER OSM DOES NOT HAVE" below, and
 * scripts/build-datacenters-power.mjs for how the two are joined.
 *
 * The layer drew 4 351 sites and its card said almost nothing about any of
 * them: 2 428 of them (55.8 %) rendered as a title and no detail line at all,
 * and the one line the rest could get came from a capacity chain
 * (`capacity:it_load` / `it_load` / `capacity` / `properties.capacity`) that
 * matches exactly THREE features in the whole pack — one each, and the fourth
 * key does not exist in the file at any level. So the card was, in practice,
 * the operator's name or nothing.
 *
 * This module is the same arrangement `damsPack.js` and `airportsPack.js`
 * already use: the file that decides what a card says lives beside the data it
 * says it about, is pure (no Cesium, no DOM, no network) and is under test, so
 * a dropped field is a failing assertion rather than a blank line nobody
 * notices.
 *
 * ── WHAT IS ACTUALLY IN THE PACK ────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Measured over all 4 351 features (313 distinct OSM tag keys):
 *
 *     telecom            4 177  96.0 %   a constant — never a card line
 *     name               3 405  78.3 %
 *     building           3 218  74.0 %
 *     operator           2 619  60.2 %
 *     operator:wikidata  1 352  31.1 %
 *     website              929  21.4 %
 *     ref                  868  19.9 %
 *     building:levels      374   8.6 %
 *     operator:short       344   7.9 %
 *     start_date           188   4.3 %
 *     height               154   3.5 %
 *
 * And essentially NO power vocabulary: every key matching
 * /power|generator|capacity|load|energy|cool|pue|ups|diesel/ together covers
 * 24 features. `data_center:power` — the only one that is a real IT-load
 * figure — is on six, five of them French (Digital Realty MRS1 16 MW, MRS2
 * 16 MW, MRS3 24 MW, MRS4 20 MW, Phocea DC 1.2 MW) and it was NOT among the
 * keys the old card read. It is now.
 *
 * ── THE ONE FACT THE PACK HELD AND NEVER PUBLISHED: SIZE ────────────────────
 *
 * 3 517 of the 4 351 features (80.8 %) are polygons, and their footprint spans
 * five orders of magnitude — p05 417 m², median 5 741 m², p95 50 519 m², max
 * 7 044 428 m² — and until now every one of them rendered as the same 10 px
 * dot. That is the most discriminating thing in the file and it costs nothing
 * to compute: the whole pack is 46 596 vertices, and the render path already
 * walks each polygon's positions once to place its stem.
 *
 * ── AND NOW DRAWS. THE FOUR SIGNS, AND WHY THEY ARE FOUR ────────────────────
 *
 * The size channel is spent in WORLD UNITS, not in screen pixels: the emprise
 * is drawn where it is, at the metre count it has, so it shrinks with distance
 * the way a building does. That is the branch of B2 that a physical object is
 * entitled to — the alternative, a constant-pixel disc scaled by area, would
 * claim a hall is legible from orbit, which it is not. The anchor dot drops
 * from 10 px to 6 px and stops being the size channel; it is now only the
 * stem's head and the card's hook.
 *
 * Measured over the whole shipped pack (4 638 features), the four render
 * classes and their counts:
 *
 *     volume   461   9.9 %   building polygon + a published height
 *     slab   2 739  59.1 %   building polygon, height NOT published
 *     site     317   6.8 %   polygon with no `building` tag — a fence
 *     point  1 121  24.2 %   no polygon at all
 *
 * `point` is the class the DCWatch merge grew: 834 OSM nodes plus the 287
 * French sites DCWatch locates and nobody has ever traced. They draw the same
 * hollow ring for the same reason — the position is known and the emprise was
 * never surveyed — so the merge needed no fifth sign.
 *
 * `slab` is 59 % of the pack — and 63 % of its OSM half, which is the
 * population the decision was made on — and it is the reason nothing gets a
 * default height (A1): six OSM features in ten would then be standing at a
 * height nobody measured. A slab is flat, and flat is the sign for "emprise
 * connue, hauteur inconnue". A `point` is a HOLLOW ring, not a disc, because
 * there is no emprise to be small — there is no emprise at all, and "small"
 * and "absent" must not share a mark.
 *
 * Height is read from `height` first (154 features, 3.5 %) because it is
 * already metres, then from `building:levels` (374, 8.6 %), which has to be
 * converted. The conversion factor is MEASURED, not assumed: 59 features carry
 * both tags, and their height-per-storey is a median 5.0 m (p25 4.0, p75 6.7).
 * Five metres is a data hall, not an office floor, and it is what
 * {@link DATACENTER_LEVEL_HEIGHT_M} says. The 461 resulting extrusions run
 * 3 m → 170 m, median 12.2 m.
 *
 * ── COLOUR, WHICH THIS LAYER HAD NEVER SPENT ────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Every datacenter was cyan, so hue carried nothing. It now carries the one
 * distinction the footprint number cannot survive without: a hall is cyan, a
 * SITE OUTLINE is slate. Fill opacity is a single constant across all three
 * surface classes precisely so that it encodes nothing (A3) — form says what
 * is known, hue says what the polygon outlines, and the polygon's own extent
 * says how big.
 *
 * ── BUT A POLYGON IS NOT ALWAYS A BUILDING ──────────────────────────────────
 *
 * This is the trap, and it is why {@link datacenterFootprint} returns a KIND
 * and not just a number. 317 polygons carry no `building` tag (or
 * `building=no`), and they are site outlines, not buildings: median 31 204 m²
 * against 5 008 m² for the 3 200 that do carry one. `Meta Los Lunas Data
 * Center` is explicitly `building=no` and measures 2 033 401 m²; `Data4 Campus
 * Paris Saclay` is 343 709 m². Printing "emprise au sol" over those would be a
 * measurement of the fence, presented as a measurement of the hall — so the
 * two are worded differently, from the tag, every time.
 *
 * Areas are prefixed `≈` and rounded to two significant figures. OSM outlines
 * are volunteer tracings, not a survey, and the number must not read like one.
 *
 * ── THE POWER OSM DOES NOT HAVE ─────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Everything above is what a volunteer can trace from the outside. How much
 * electricity the building draws is not, and it shows: five French features in
 * 372 publish `data_center:power`, and the three other capacity keys the card
 * reads match one feature each in the whole world.
 *
 * DCWatch — a collaborative research database under ODbL, built after the
 * ADEME/Arcep work published in January 2026 — publishes a collected figure in
 * megawatts for 400 of its 427 French rows. `scripts/build-datacenters-power.mjs`
 * folds it in, and the result over the shipped pack is:
 *
 *      53  OSM features pinned to a DCWatch row, 51 of them with a power
 *     287  DCWatch sites in operation appended as Points, 282 with a power
 *      78  DCWatch PROJECTS deliberately left out — see the build script
 *     333  French sites now carrying a power, 2 301 MW in total
 *
 * Only two DCWatch columns reach this file: `power_total_mw` and
 * `operation_start_year`. The two floor areas do not, because they are one
 * number and a constant — the build script measures the ratio and says so —
 * and this module must have no field a reader could mistake for a survey.
 *
 * Where a DCWatch value reaches a card, {@link datacenterCardDetails} signs the
 * card. A mapped `data_center:power` always outranks the DCWatch figure, so
 * signing is not merely decorative: it says which of two databases spoke.
 *
 * Sources:  OpenStreetMap (`telecom=data_center`), ODbL 1.0, and
 *           DCWatch (https://gitlab.com/hubblo/datacenter-watch), ODbL.
 * See also: src/data/local_data/datacenters/README.md, which records that the
 *           OSM snapshot's extraction date and query were never written down —
 *           so this module reads what is there and claims nothing about its
 *           vintage — and dcwatch/SOURCE.md, which records DCWatch's.
