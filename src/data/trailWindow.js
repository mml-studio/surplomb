/**
 * How much history a track trail shows — measured in GROUND LENGTH, not in
 * number of fixes.
 *
 * ── The defect ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Three layers shipped the same constant, `TRAIL_MAX_POINTS = 400`:
 * `flights.js`, `militaryFlights.js` and `aisLiveVessels.js`. One number for a
 * vessel at 5 m/s and an airliner at 250 m/s — a fifty-fold difference in what
 * a fix is worth on the ground.
 *
 * The consequence is a false statement about time. At a ~15 s poll, 400
 * airliner fixes span on the order of 1 500 km and the trail crosses the whole
 * screen; 400 vessel fixes span a few kilometres and the trail fits inside the
 * chevron. A reader comparing the two sees a plane with a long past and a ship
 * that looks as though it has just appeared — when both have been tracked for
 * exactly as long (CARTOGRAPHY E: a temporal encoding must mean the same
 * thing for every subject that carries it).
 *
 * ── The rule ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Every trail shows the same LENGTH OF GROUND behind its contact. That is the
 * quantity a reader actually compares on a map — screen length is ground
 * length — and it needs no speed estimate, so a contact that stops, turns, or
 * reports irregularly is handled by the same arithmetic as one in cruise.
 *
 * Two guards keep the honest cases honest:
 *
 * • A FLOOR of `minPoints` fixes. A moored ship covers no ground, and pruning
 *   purely by length would collapse its trail to a dot — erasing the fact that
 *   it has been watched for an hour. The floor keeps a short, visible history
 *   for a stationary contact.
 *
 * • A CEILING of `maxPoints` vertices, the old constant's real job: a bound on
 *   the primitive rebuilt on every poll.
 *
 * Distances are computed on the WGS84 ellipsoid chord (`Cartesian3.distance`),
 * which is what the drawn polyline's own segments measure. Over the segment
 * lengths involved, the chord and the great circle differ by parts in 10^7 —
 * far below the precision this window needs, and the polyline is the thing
 * being trimmed.

/**
 * Default ground length shown behind a contact.

 * 260 km is roughly 17 minutes of airliner cruise and a comfortable fraction
 * of a continental view: long enough to read a turn or a hold, short enough
 * that a dense sky does not become a ball of string. The same 260 km is a
 * ship's last several hours — which is the point: the two trails now say the
 * same thing about distance instead of the same thing about fix count.
