/**
 * Vigicrues — France's official river-flood vigilance map.
 *
 * The SCHAPI (Service central d'hydrométéorologie et d'appui à la prévision
 * des inondations) publishes one keyless GeoJSON holding every monitored
 * river reach ("tronçon de vigilance crues") with its current 4-level
 * vigilance colour. This is the state's own reading of French flood risk —
 * Hub'Eau (see `hubeauHydrometry.js`) carries the raw gauge measurements
 * underneath it.
 *
 * MEASURED against the live feed on 2026-08-26:
 *   - `GET /services/InfoVigiCru.geojson` → 200, 2,245,691 bytes, NO gzip
 *     (the origin ignores `Accept-Encoding`), and NO ETag or Last-Modified,
 *     so a conditional GET is impossible
 *   - 337 reaches, all `MultiLineString`, 537 line parts, 56,110 vertices
 *   - every reach carried `NivInfViCr: 1` (green) — late August, no episode
 *   - the map is republished twice a day, at 10:00 and 16:00 Paris (the file
 *     lands ~5 min early), and "at any moment" during an episode
 *
 * WHY THIS GOES THROUGH A PROXY even though the origin sends CORS headers and
 * a direct browser fetch works: 2.2 MB uncompressed with no conditional GET,
 * against a map that changes twice a day, means any useful poll cadence costs
 * hundreds of megabytes a day for two meaningful changes. The `/api/vigicrues`
 * proxy splits the feed along its real seam — a ~1.1 MB geometry document
 * fetched ONCE per session, and a ~3 KB level document that is polled — joined
 * by `geometryVersion`. Measured end to end: 2,245,691 → 3,116 bytes per poll.
 *
 * The honest headline for this layer: **outside a flood episode every reach is
 * green.** It is therefore drawn as "the monitored river network of France,
 * dim" in calm weather, and only lights up — wider strokes, labels, non-zero
 * alert counts — when a reach is raised to yellow/orange/red. Labels are
 * published ONLY for raised reaches, so a calm France costs zero label work.
 *
 * The reaches are clamped ground polylines, so they follow the same
 * surface-classification rule the submarine-cable layer established: classify
 * against ONLY the active surface (Google 3D tiles under the photoreal stack,
 * terrain under the globe stacks), and fall back to BOTH for an unknown
 * stack rather than risk drawing nothing.

/**
 * VISIBILITY — AND THE ONE LEVEL WHERE COLOUR IS NOT A SIGNAL.
 * -----------------------------------------------------------
 * The reaches were drawn as flat 1.4–6 px lines at alphas as low as 0.5, and
 * disappeared into every basemap we ship: the dark official green over IGN
 * ortho's dark vegetation, and all four hues over Plan IGN's pale hydrography
 * — which is drawn in the same blues and greens, in the same places, because
 * it is the same rivers.
 *
 * Widening and un-fading (below) fixed yellow, orange and red. It did not fix
 * green, and could not: `#009245` is a DARK green, the photoreal and IGN ortho
 * basemaps are mostly vegetation, and no amount of alpha separates a dark green
 * line from a dark green hillside. A 3 px stroke you have to hunt for is the
 * same as no stroke.
 *
 * ── Why green may be repainted and the other three may not ──────────────────
 *
 * Licence Ouverte 2.0 forbids distorting the MEANING of the information. The
 * meaning of levels 2-4 is carried by their hue: yellow, orange and red are how
 * the state says "something is happening", they are what a reader recognises
 * from every other vigilance map, and they are pinned byte-for-byte in
 * `vigicrues.test.mjs`. Repainting one of those would be the distortion.
 *
 * Level 1 says "pas de vigilance particulière requise" — it is the ABSENCE of a
 * signal, and on an ordinary day it is 337 reaches out of 337. What the layer
 * is actually drawing then is the monitored river network of France, which is
 * what the module header has always said it draws. So the calm level is painted
 * as water — a cyan no basemap and no other level uses — while the level it
 * represents stays stated in words everywhere a reader meets it: the legend row
 * names it and repeats the service's own sentence, and `level`/`levelLabel`
 * still carry 1 and 'VERT' to the analyst engine and to every entity property.
 * Nothing claims a reach is calm that the feed did not publish as calm; the
 * moment a reach is raised it leaves this branch and gets the state's colour.
 *
 * The official swatch is kept on every level as `color` and is what the pinned
 * test asserts. `stroke` is what reaches the canvas, and differs from `color`
 * for exactly one level.
 *
 * A dark casing under each reach would have been another lever, and the gas
 * layer next door built and measured one first. It scored WORSE than simply
 * widening the flat stroke: `msaaSamples: 4` under Cesium's FXAA stage leaves
 * a cased core largely edge-blend, and a hue leaves a ±24 tolerance at only
 * ~10 % casing contamination. Applied to a raised reach that is not merely a
 * worse render, it is a licence problem — a casing that dims a vigilance colour
 * toward black is the distortion the licence prohibits, reached through a
 * rendering side door. See the measured table in `gasFrance.js`.
 */

/**
 * The four vigilance levels, in the state's own vocabulary and colours.
 * `NivInfViCr` carries the level as a small integer; anything outside 1..4
 * (including the `null` the feed has been observed to emit for a reach with
 * no current assessment) is UNKNOWN and is not drawn as green — inventing a
 * reassuring colour for missing data is the one failure mode a vigilance map
 * must not have.
 *
 * The ladder stays strictly monotonic in `width`: severity is legible from
 * weight alone, before any colour is read, which is what a colour-blind
 * visitor and a screenshot at low zoom both depend on.
 *
 * GREEN IS DELIBERATELY THE QUIETEST THING THAT IS STILL VISIBLE. It is the
 * overwhelming majority of the feed on an ordinary day — 337 of 337 reaches in
 * the snapshot this was tuned against — so it gets the alpha that makes it
 * findable and none of the weight that would make a calm country look like an
 * episode. The gap between green and yellow is therefore the widest step on
 * the ladder, on purpose: "something is happening" has to break the pattern.
