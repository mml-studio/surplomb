# Contributing to Surplomb

Thanks for being here. Surplomb is an open foundation for live spatial intelligence in the browser, and it gets better when more people run it, break it, and extend it.

## Getting set up

Use Node.js 24.14.x or 26.x (also enforced by `package.json`).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mml-studio/surplomb.git
cd surplomb
nvm install 24.14.0
nvm use 24.14.0
npm install
./scripts/dev-fresh.sh        # or: npm run dev
```

**No key is required.** The globe boots on keyless satellite imagery and most data layers need no account. A **Google Maps API key** with the Map Tiles API enabled adds the photorealistic 3D planet (in the EEA, a free Cesium ion token does the same — see the [README](README.md#-api-keys)). On macOS the launcher pulls keys from the Keychain; on any platform you can pass them as env vars or use a `.env` (copy `.env.example`).

Open `http://localhost:4173`. Before sending a PR run `npm run build`, `npm test`, and `npm run test:track` (dev server must be up) — **all three must stay green.**

## Good first contributions

The highest-leverage places to jump in:

- **🌆 Add a CCTV source pack.** Austin is the reference camera source. Adding another city means a clean public camera catalog with coordinates, attribution, and server-registered frame URLs (the proxy only fetches registered URLs — never client-supplied ones, see [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md)). City packs are the best first lane.
- **🔌 Plug a dataset — one JSON file, no code.** Drop a manifest in `datasets/<id>.json` (or paste the dataset's address into **＋ BRANCHER UN JEU DE DONNÉES** under the layer list and copy the manifest it produces) and the layer is on the panel at the next build: group, source line, credit, card and legend derive from the file. `npm run dataset:manifest -- <url>` writes one from a data.gouv.fr page, an Opendatasoft page, a WFS or a bare GeoJSON/CSV. Contract and limits: [`docs/DATASETS.md`](docs/DATASETS.md).
- **🛰️ Add or improve a data layer.** Each layer is one self-contained module in `src/data/<layer>.js` implementing the layer interface (`init/enable/disable/update/destroy/getStats`, optional `getDetectableObjects`/`getStats`). Use an existing layer as a template.
- **🎙️ Extend voice control.** Voice tools are declared server-side (`GEV_REALTIME_TOOLS` in `vite.config.js`) and executed client-side (`src/voice/gevActions.js`). Keep the tool surface tight and the responses honest (confirm only what actually happened).
- **🎨 Add a visual style.** Styles are GLSL post-process shaders in `src/styles/`.
- **🐛 Fix bugs / improve the first-run experience.** See [docs/KNOWN-ISSUES.md](docs/KNOWN-ISSUES.md); the three first-run variants are described in [docs/CURRENT-STATE.md](docs/CURRENT-STATE.md).

## Finding a French data source (`.mcp.json`)

`.mcp.json` registers the **official data.gouv.fr MCP server** (`https://mcp.data.gouv.fr/mcp`, no key, read-only) so a compatible AI assistant can search the national open-data catalog while you work. It's a discovery aid for authors — `search_datasets`, `search_dataservices`, `get_dataservice_openapi_spec` and `list_dataset_resources` beat guessing at dataset URLs when you're scoping a new layer.

The step after a hit is one command. The dataset id or resource id the MCP returns is exactly what the manifest tool opens:

```
search_datasets("défibrillateurs")                         # MCP → dataset 61556e1e9d6adb2df86eb0fc
list_dataset_resources("61556e1e9d6adb2df86eb0fc")         # MCP → the CSV resource
npm run dataset:manifest -- 61556e1e9d6adb2df86eb0fc       # writes datasets/<id>.json
```

The tool reads the same REST endpoints the MCP wraps, profiles the columns on the Tabular API, guesses the geometry and says why, and reminds you that the licence it read is confirmed on the dataset's page. See [`docs/DATASETS.md`](docs/DATASETS.md).

It is **not** a runtime data path, and no product code should call it:

- Its CORS preflight answers `403` — the browser can't reach it.
- Its tools return prose for a model to read, not typed JSON. The plain REST API (`https://www.data.gouv.fr/api/2/datasets/resources/<id>/`) returns real fields and is what layers and scripts should use.
- data.gouv.fr call the server experimental and warn its answers "peuvent être incomplètes, erronées ou inclure des hallucinations", recommending their APIs for anything serious.

Layers already fetch the same platform directly: 162 pinned `www.data.gouv.fr/api/1/datasets/r/<uuid>` resources, mostly the national transport access point's GTFS feeds in `config/pan_gtfs_*.json`.

⚠️ **Never source a licence claim from an MCP answer.** Use it to find a candidate; confirm the licence and attribution on the dataset's own page before it goes into [DATA_SOURCES.md](DATA_SOURCES.md).

## Architecture in one minute

- **No framework.** Vanilla JS + [CesiumJS](https://cesium.com/platform/cesiumjs/) + [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/).
- **UI lives in `src/ui.js`** (panels, HUD, styles, the control facade). **Layer logic lives in `src/data/<layer>.js`.** Keep them separate.
- **Secrets stay server-side.** Anything needing a private key goes through a Vite proxy in `vite.config.js`. The browser only ever sees the Google Maps key (which you restrict) and ephemeral tokens.
- `docs/CURRENT-STATE.md` is the authoritative runtime reference — read it first.

## QA harnesses (and the welcome card)

Every headless harness is a *fresh browser*, and the first-run card
([`src/firstRunExperience.js`](src/firstRunExperience.js)) shows once per
browser by design — so every harness meets it. Left alone it sits over the
globe and swallows the clicks, pixels, and focus a harness is trying to
measure — the failure usually looks like a broken layer, not like a modal.
Variant C's bubble (`#first-run-hint`) is hidden by the same suppression.

So: **open the page with `newQaPage(browser)`**, never `browser.newPage()`.

```js
import { newQaPage } from './lib/qa-first-run.mjs';   // scripts/lib/qa-first-run.mjs

const page = await newQaPage(browser);                 // card already handled
```

`npm test` enforces this: [`src/qaFirstRunSuppression.test.mjs`](src/qaFirstRunSuppression.test.mjs)
audits every `scripts/qa-*.mjs` that navigates and fails with the fix in the
message. `firstRunLauncherSuppressed(page)` is there if a harness wants to
*prove* the card is out of its shot; `scripts/qa-firstrun.mjs` is the one
exemption, because the card is its subject.

**Testing by hand in a real browser?** Open
`http://localhost:4173/?welcome=0` — same suppression, nothing to click away.
(`?welcome=1` forces the card back when you do want to see it, and
`?welcome=A`, `B` or `C` forces that variant: A asks for an address, B offers
three questions, C is the bubble on the search field.)

### The 3D globe costs money per boot

Google Photorealistic 3D Tiles reach this app through Cesium ion, which bills
them by **root tile** — and one root tile is one successful request to the ion
endpoint. So **every boot of the app spends one**, whether or not the run ever
looks at the ground. The free tier allows 1 000 a month, `scripts/` holds 113
harnesses that boot the app, and they share one token across every workspace:
in September 2026 they passed 1 000 by the fifteenth.

The app itself opens on the keyless satellite stack and buys the tileset on the
reader's first rest under 25 km (`src/photorealAdoption.js`), so a boot nobody
touches costs nothing. A harness touches the camera constantly, though, so it
would buy one on almost every run — and `newQaPage()` therefore closes the door
outright. The app lands on OSM and
the `photoreal` chip reads *"off for this session"* — which is a switch, not a
failure, and the tray says so.

```js
const page = await newQaPage(browser);                        // OSM, costs nothing
const page = await newQaPage(browser, { photoreal: true });   // 3D globe, one root tile
```

Opt back in whenever the harness measures something **against Google's 3D
surface** — ground clamping, seating, mesh floors, altitude, or the map-source
tray itself. If a run suddenly disagrees about a height, this is the first
thing to check.

By hand, the same switch is `http://localhost:4173/?photoreal=0`.

## Language

**Everything in this repository and on its GitHub pages is written in English:**
code, comments, docs, commit messages, pull-request titles and descriptions,
review comments. Surplomb is a French product, but its contributors and its
upstream, [God's Eye View](https://github.com/bilawalsidhu/gods-eye-view), are
not all French speakers.

The exceptions are deliberate and narrow:

- **What the reader sees is bilingual.** The interface speaks French by default
  and English on request; every visible string lives in the module's
  `<module>.i18n.js` catalog with its French and English side by side. Never
  hard-code a visible string in either language. (The catalogs arrive with the
  i18n infrastructure; until a module is migrated, leave its French strings
  where they are rather than translating them in place.)
- **Data is not prose.** Commune names, DVF property types, crime categories
  and every other value read from a French source stay as published; only
  their display label is translated.
- **The legal pages** (`mentions-legales.html`, `confidentialite.html`) are
  French and the French text governs.
- **[`docs/GLOSSARY.md`](docs/GLOSSARY.md)** pairs the French terms with the
  English ones the docs and the interface use — *commune* → *municipality*,
  *DVF* → *property sales (DVF)*. Use its words; add a missing term to the
  section of its domain.

Commits and pull requests before 2026-09-19 are mostly in French. They are
left as they are.

## Coding style

- ES modules, **2-space indent, single quotes, semicolons.**
- JSDoc on exported/public functions.
- Match the surrounding code — comment density, naming, and idiom.
- Prefer small, reviewable commits. A commit subject says what the reader saw and what changed (*"Links to Lyon opened sales on an empty map: camera rounding noise no longer blocks moveEnd"*); the body argues the decision. Conventional-commit-style prefixes (`feat:`, `fix:`, `perf:`, `docs:`) are appreciated but not required.

## Pull requests

1. Branch off `main`.
2. Keep `npm run build`, `npm test`, and `npm run test:track` green and avoid new console errors.
3. If you change runtime behavior, update `docs/CURRENT-STATE.md` and `CHANGELOG.md` in the same PR.
4. If you add or change a data source, update [DATA_SOURCES.md](DATA_SOURCES.md) with its license and attribution. **Don't add data you don't have the right to redistribute** — fetch it at runtime instead.
5. Describe what you changed and how you verified it (screenshots welcome for anything visual). The [pull-request template](.github/pull_request_template.md) has the sections.

## Ground rules

- This is a tool for **public** data. Don't add scraping of sources whose terms forbid it, private/paywalled datasets, or anything that misrepresents public-data inference as authoritative intelligence.
- Be decent to each other. Assume good faith, keep it constructive.
