// src/data/bdtopoBuildingsFeed.js — the BD TOPO building schema, and the
// arithmetic that decides where a building's floor goes.
//
// Everything here is pure and node-testable. The Cesium drawing lives in
// `bdtopoBuildings.js`; this file is where the upstream traps are held down,
// under test against a real captured IGN vector tile.
//
// ── The four traps ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// 1. **`precision_altimetrique: 9999` is not a precision.** It is the IGN
//    sentinel for "this building has no Z at all" — `methode_d_acquisition_
//    altimetrique: "Pas de Z"`. Read literally it says ±10 km, which would let
//    any building pass any altimetric check ever written.
//
// 2. **Half of France publishes roof altitudes and half does not.** Lyon,
//    Marseille and Grenoble carry `altitude_maximale_toit` and
//    `altitude_maximale_sol` (photogrammetry / correlation). Paris carries
//    NEITHER — its buildings come from the cadastre with an interpolated Z, so
//    only `altitude_minimale_sol`, `altitude_minimale_toit` and `hauteur` are
//    there. Measured 2026-08-31 on z16 tiles: roof altitude present for 96% of
//    Lyon, 0% of Paris. A seating rule that assumes the roof altitude erases
//    Paris; one that assumes only `hauteur` throws away the better data
//    everywhere else. Hence the hierarchy in `seatBuilding`.
//
// 3. **The altitudes are NGF-IGN69, the globe is WGS84.** Orthometric, not
//    ellipsoidal: h = H + N, N ≈ +44 m over Paris and +51 m over Grenoble.
//    Forget it and the whole city sinks 45 m into the terrain.
//
// 4. **One building can be several features.** A building straddling two tiles
//    appears cut in both, each piece carrying the same `cleabs`. Both pieces
//    must be DRAWN (they re-join) and the building COUNTED once.
