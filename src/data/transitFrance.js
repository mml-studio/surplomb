/**
 * @module transitFrance
 *
 * Live ground transit for France — the buses, trams, metros and interurban
 * coaches that are moving *right now*, from the GTFS-Realtime vehicle-position
 * feeds published on the Point d'Accès National (`transport.data.gouv.fr`).
 *
 * WHY THIS LAYER EXISTS: everything else on this globe flies, floats or orbits.
 * Ground transit is the one live layer where the contact is a vehicle a person
 * is sitting in, on a street you can descend to in the 3D scene — and France
 * publishes ~150 such feeds, keyless, under Licence Ouverte 2.0 or ODbL 1.0,
 * as an obligation of EU regulation 2017/1926.
 *
 * HOW IT LOADS: per viewport, never nationally. The dev-server proxy
 * (`/api/transit-fr/vehicles`, see `vite.config.js`) resolves which networks
 * intersect the camera's box, fetches only those protobuf bodies, decodes them
 * and returns the vehicles inside the box. Above {@link ACTIVATION_ALTITUDE_M}
 * the layer reports a `zoom-in` guidance state rather than fanning out over
 * every network in the country.
 *
 * WHAT IS REAL AND WHAT IS DISPLAY:
 *   - Position, bearing, speed, stop status and occupancy are the operator's
 *     own reported values, passed through unchanged. The bearing is drawn as a
 *     small wedge ORBITING the vehicle icon rather than by rotating the icon
 *     itself: the icons are front views, and a bus seen head-on turned to face
 *     west is not a bus facing west. A vehicle whose feed publishes no bearing
 *     has no wedge — which is the same statement the bare disc used to make.
 *   - The glyph GLIDES between two consecutive reported fixes, over the time
 *     the operator actually took to report them. Like the flights layer, the
 *     scene therefore renders one fix interval behind live, and never
 *     extrapolates past the newest fix: every drawn position lies on the
 *     segment between two things the feed actually said, travelled at the
 *     speed the feed implies. The card always prints the age of the real fix.
 *   - KIND is the vehicle's own class — bus, tram, metro, ferry — drawn with
 *     the matching Material Symbol (`transitVehicleIcons.js`) and tinted its
 *     own colour, and joined from the network's static GTFS `route_type` by
 *     `scripts/build-pan-route-types.mjs` and resolved in the proxy. Measured
 *     2026-08-31 it types 92.7% of the national live fleet: 86.9% from the
 *     vehicle's own `route_id`, the rest from networks where every published
 *     route is one class. Three networks resolve nothing — Tours Fil Bleu and
 *     one of Le Havre's two feeds publish no usable `route_id`, Valenciennes
 *     Transvilles publishes ids that are in no `routes.txt` — and those keep
 *     the neutral glyph and say `Type unknown` rather than being guessed at.
 *   - MODE is the network's declared SERVICE class (`urban`, `intercity`,
 *     `school`…). It is not a vehicle type and never was; it is the fallback
 *     when the kind join finds nothing, and the card labels it as such.
 *   - ROUTE is the feed's `route_id`, unwrapped from its NeTEx envelope when it
 *     has one. Networks that publish an opaque internal key show that key.
 *   - OCCUPANCY is published by almost nobody: 9% of the national fleet on
 *     2026-08-31 (Palm Bus, SudLib and TCAT essentially alone). SPEED by half
 *     of it. Both are drawn only when the operator sent them, and neither is
 *     advertised as a feature of the layer.
 *   - DELAY and DISRUPTION are the same 150 networks' OTHER two GTFS-Realtime
 *     messages, joined to the vehicle already on screen rather than drawn as a
 *     layer of their own: how far off the timetable the operator says this run
 *     is, whether it has been cancelled, which of its remaining stops it will
 *     skip, and what has been written about its line. The proxy does the join
 *     (one companion body is up to 1.2 MB, and it would otherwise cross the
 *     wire per client to answer the same question); `transitSchedule.js` holds
 *     the rules. Measured
 *     2026-08-31 over the 30 largest live networks: 67% of vehicles join a
 *     trip update, 38% end up with a deviation — the rest run on networks that
 *     publish an absolute predicted TIME and never a delay, which cannot be
 *     converted without the 223 MB `stop_times.txt` this layer refuses to
 *     load. A vehicle with no published deviation says so instead of showing
 *     zero, and a bus parked at its terminus waiting for a departure an hour
 *     away is reported as waiting rather than as an hour early.
