/**
 * Deterministic browser proof for the six French address layers.
 *
 * `georisques`, `dvf-sales`, `dpe-fr`, `urbanisme-gpu`, `idfm-network` and
 * `ads-fr` are the only layers in the app that scan around the point the
 * camera is LOOKING AT rather than over the viewport, and they draw nothing at
 * all above 12 km. Both behaviours are invisible to a unit test and both fail
 * silently: a scan centred on the wrong block, or a dormant layer, looks
 * exactly like a layer with no data.
 *
 * So this harness proves the things only a real Cesium scene can:
 *
 *   i.   each layer draws entities over the reference address (avenue de
 *        France, Paris 13e) — the address the mission storyboard is built on
 *   ii.  each layer's scan centre lands within 400 m of that address, so the
 *        camera look-at derivation is doing its job
 *   iii. above the activation ceiling the layers go DORMANT and clear their
 *        draw, rather than leaving a block-scale answer on screen at
 *        region scale
 *   iv.  the honesty fields survive to the browser: DVF reports fewer
 *        comparables than sales, DPE reports more diagnostics than it drew,
 *        and the GPU outlines declare themselves simplified
 *   v.   IDFM reports its own live-vehicle absence rather than looking broken
 *   vi.  NAVIGATING re-scans without waiting for the manager's tick. These
 *        layers refresh every 5 to 15 minutes — right for registers that move
 *        in weeks, useless for someone flying across a city — so they listen to
 *        `camera.moveEnd`. Without it the reported symptom is a layer that
 *        "has trouble refreshing" when you move, then catches up minutes later.
 *   vii. clicking a drawn marker OPENS A CARD. The app runs with
 *        `infoBox: false`, so a marker with a perfectly good `description` is
 *        inert until its layer owns a LEFT_CLICK handler — the first version of
 *        these layers shipped exactly that way and every other check still
 *        passed
 *   viii. clicking BARE GROUND on the urbanism layer answers for that ground.
 *        The zoning map is drawn for a whole block and used to carry its words
 *        on one 26-pixel glyph, so the plot opposite could be seen and not
 *        read. Only a real scene can prove this: it needs a pick to say the
 *        pixel belongs to nobody, a geometric resolve of the coordinate, and a
 *        point-in-polygon against what is actually drawn
 *   ix.  over BORDEAUX, the one address in France where a permit has a
 *        published SHAPE, that the ground is drawn once per PLOT rather than
 *        once per dossier standing on it, and that clicking the ground opens
 *        the plot's own card. A duplicate wash is not a visible defect — it is
 *        a plot painted darker than its neighbours for having a thicker file —
 *        so nothing but a count catches it
 *
 * Screenshots are written under the gitignored `qa-shots/address-layers/`.
