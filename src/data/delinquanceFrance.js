/**
 * Recorded delinquency in France, drawn with the publisher's own caution.
 *
 * THIS IS NOT A MAP OF CRIME. It is a map of what police and gendarmerie
 * REGISTERED. A commune's number moves when its residents report more, when a
 * brigade opens, when a service changes how it records — and, for a whole
 * family of indicators, when the police go looking. `Usage de stupéfiants` is
 * counted in `Mis en cause`: people who were stopped. Drawing that as a
 * property of a place is drawing policing and labelling it crime, so the
 * sentence is on the card, on the legend, in DATA_SOURCES and here.
 *
 * A CHOROPLETH OF THIS DATA WITH NO CAVEAT IS A DEFAMATION MACHINE POINTED AT
 * WHOLE COMMUNES. Everything below exists to stop that.
 *
 * ── The three states, and why the third one is the whole layer ──────────────
 * The SSMSI suppresses small counts. Its rule, verbatim from the methodology
 * PDF: *« Les données diffusées sont limitées aux communes pour lesquelles
 * plus de 5 faits ont été enregistrés pendant 3 années successives »*, with the
 * other half — *« La base de données diffusée fournit également l'information
 * sur l'absence de faits enregistrés lorsqu'elle se reproduit sur 3 années
 * successives »* — meaning a published `0` is a real, deliberate zero. So
 * every cell is exactly one of three things and each gets its own visual:
 *
 *   PUBLIÉ       a measured rate — the six-band warm ramp.
 *   AUCUN FAIT   `diff` with 0 — the palest cool wash. Measured absence.
 *   NON DIFFUSÉ  `ndiff` — SLATE, at a heavier alpha, with a wider brighter
 *                outline. It is not the bottom of the ramp and it is not the
 *                zero wash; it is off the scale entirely, in a hue the ramp
 *                never reaches, because the honest statement is "this is
 *                withheld", not "this is low".
 *
 * Measured on the 2025 edition, 523 800 commune cells: 49 879 published
 * (9.52%), 222 776 zero (42.5%), **251 145 suppressed (47.9%)**. 25 314 of the
 * 34 920 communes — 72.5% — carry not one positive published value, and 7 have
 * all fifteen indicators suppressed. Nearly half of this map is a refusal, and
 * the layer is built so a reader sees the refusal rather than a colour.
 *
 * ── THE PARAPHRASE THIS FILE USED TO PRINT, AND WHY IT WAS WRONG ───────────
 * An earlier revision of this layer put « entre 1 et 5 faits » on the card of
 * every withheld commune. That is not the rule and the register refutes it.
 * The rule is a THREE-YEAR condition on the series, so a commune that fails it
 * can carry any number at all. Re-measured against the live 2026-07-09 edition
 * on 2026-09-02:
 *   - **4 735 of the 251 145 suppressed 2025 cells** belong to a (commune,
 *     indicateur) pair that published MORE than 5 facts in 2023 or 2024. Cessy
 *     (01071) published 16 `Vols de véhicule` in 2023, then went dark.
 *   - **36 (département, indicateur) pairs carry a withheld-commune mean above
 *     5.** Seine-Saint-Denis / `Usage de stupéfiants (AFD)` averages 22.33.
 * Every surface now prints {@link delinquanceCaveat}'s verbatim quotation of
 * the SSMSI's own sentence instead. A paraphrase of a suppression rule is a
 * claim about the values being suppressed, and this one was a false one.
 *
 * ── What a suppressed commune's card is allowed to say ─────────────────────
 * The `ndiff` rows are not empty: they carry `complement_info_*`, which the PDF
 * defines as *« Valeur moyenne parmi les communes du département sous secret
 * statistique »*. Measured on 2025, grouping every suppressed row on
 * (département, indicateur): **1 470 of 1 472 pairs carry exactly one distinct
 * value.** It is a departmental constant. So it is fetched ONCE PER
 * DÉPARTEMENT, never per commune, it never touches a fill, and the card prints
 * it under the label "moyenne des communes non diffusées du département" — the
 * publisher's own words, not this commune's number.
 *
 * ── And why the withheld value can never be reconstructed ──────────────────
 * Paris publishes 75056 and its 20 arrondissements. Measured for 2025: for 14
 * of 15 indicators the arrondissements sum EXACTLY to the commune. For `Vols
 * avec armes` the commune says 393 and the arrondissements sum to 375, because
 * 4 are suppressed — and the register suppressed extra cells precisely so the
 * 18-fact residual could not be pinned on one of them. Subtracting is
 * re-identification, not recovery, and nothing here does it.
 *
 * ── Two regimes, on the two geographies the register actually publishes ────
 *   départements — the default. 96 metropolitan polygons, filled by
 *                  `taux_pour_mille` for the selected indicator and year.
 *                  There is NO suppression at this grain (the DEP base has no
 *                  `est_diffuse` column at all: 17 711 positive cells, 469
 *                  zeros, 0 nulls), so the third band never lights up here —
 *                  and that difference between the zoom levels IS the point.
 *   communes      — below {@link COMMUNE_ENTER_SPAN_DEG}. Commune outlines
 *                  from geo.api.gouv.fr for the départements in view, filled
 *                  by the three states. This is where the refusal becomes
 *                  visible: at national zoom the map looks complete, and one
 *                  zoom later half of it is slate.
 *
 * ── Why the rate and not the count ─────────────────────────────────────────
 * `delinquanceDepartements.js` carries the measurement: by count the 2025
 * cambriolages leaders are Bouches-du-Rhône, Nord, Rhône and Paris — a list of
 * big départements; by rate the leaders are Guyane, **Cher**, Ain and Isère,
 * and the Nord drops from 2nd to 17th. And the rate's denominator is not
 * uniform: `Cambriolages de logement` is per 1 000 DWELLINGS, the other
 * fourteen per 1 000 inhabitants, verified on 45 386 of 45 386 non-cambriolage
 * cells against 0 of 4 493 cambriolage ones. Every card and every legend row
 * states its own denominator.
 *
 * ── The TOTAL, which this layer used to refuse to compute ──────────────────
 * An earlier revision of this header said the layer "never sums two
 * indicators", because their `unité de compte` differs — Victime, Victime
 * entendue, Infraction, Véhicule, Mis en cause — and a total adds victims to
 * vehicles. That objection is real and it has not gone away. What changed is
 * the alternative: refusing to total meant every reader had to pick one
 * offence before seeing anything at all, which is its own distortion — it
 * makes the map answer "where are burglaries" when the question was "where is
 * this register busy".
 *
 * So the total exists, under three conditions that keep it honest:
 *   1. it is labelled a CALCULATED total, GEV's arithmetic and not the
 *      SSMSI's — the register publishes eighteen indicators and no total;
 *   2. it names its own mixed unit on the card rather than calling itself
 *      "faits", and it drops the two `Usage de stupéfiants` sub-indicators,
 *      which are a decomposition of a third (measured: parent = AFD + hors
 *      AFD in 101 départements of 101, exactly), so nothing is counted twice;
 *   3. at commune grain it is a MINORANT wherever the register withholds a
 *      contributor, and the card says how many. Measured on 2025: of the
 *      34 920 communes, 9 606 carry a positive total — **9 428 of those are
 *      minorants and only 178 are complete** — 243 are a complete measured
 *      zero, and 25 071 publish nothing at all and are drawn slate.
 * At département grain there is no suppression, so the total is exact: 3 306
 * 254 facts over 68 350 798 inhabitants nationally, from 24.4 ‰ in the Cantal
 * to 109.9 ‰ in Paris.
 *
 * Two commune outliers are worth knowing before reading the commune map:
 * **Roissy-en-France (95527) tops it at 1 512 ‰** — 4 045 facts over 2 674
 * residents — and Paris 1er at 578 ‰. Neither is a dangerous village; both are
 * places whose population at risk is an airport and a museum, not their
 * residents. The denominator is the resident population for every indicator on
 * this layer, and the total makes that limit louder rather than new.
 *
 * ── Six chips out of eighteen, chosen by the data and not by hand ──────────
 * The panel row cannot carry eighteen indicators. Hand-picking six would be a
 * claim about which offences matter; instead the chip set is derived at build
 * time as the indicators with the most communes carrying a published positive
 * value — the maps with the most ground that can honestly be coloured. On the
 * 2025 edition that is escroqueries (8 134 communes), dégradations (7 350),
 * vols sans violence (5 181), violences intrafamiliales (4 682), cambriolages
 * (4 493) and violences hors famille (3 224). All fifteen commune-grain
 * indicators — and all eighteen at département grain — stay readable on a
 * clicked card; only six can be painted, and that is a stated limit.
 *
 * ── The palette, against the neighbours it will be stacked on ──────────────
 * Warm sequential gold → crimson for the published ramp. It is deliberately
 * NOT the Vigilance green→red (that ramp means "danger forecast", and this one
 * must never be read as a warning), not the IRVE blue→red power ramp, not the
 * sup-fr violet and not the schools-fr green. The slate of the suppressed band
 * sits outside the ramp's hue range entirely, so no amount of squinting turns
 * "withheld" into "a bit less than the palest gold".

// every claim the long one made (recorded ≠ committed, the 12 %/74 % reporting
// spread, the three-year suppression condition, the residence-not-scene note,
// and for the computed total its authorship) and drops the wording;
// the chip puts the wording back for the reader who wants to check it, and
// the row legend's blurbs carry the full quotes at all times.
//
// The one thing the compact register ADDS is the unit: `2 597 victimes, soit
// 6,22 pour 1 000 habitants`. The old card printed « 6,22 pour 1 000
// habitants · 2 597 faits », which named neither what was counted nor, for
// four indicators of five, the right noun.

/**
 * The caveat that rides on every card this layer draws.
 *
 * It is not decoration and it is not the same sentence for every indicator:
 * an offence counted in `Mis en cause` is a count of people the police
 * stopped, which is a different kind of claim from a victim's report, and the
 * card says which one the reader is looking at.
 *
 * In `méthodo` it QUOTES rather than paraphrases, and that is a correction,
 * not a style choice. This function used to tell a reader that a withheld cell
 * held « entre 1 et 5 faits ». Measured on 2026-09-02 over the real base, that
 * is false for **4 735 of the 251 145 suppressed 2025 cells**, whose own
 * (commune, indicateur) series published MORE than 5 facts in 2023 or 2024 —
 * Cessy (01071) published 16 `Vols de véhicule` in 2023 and is withheld now.
 * The rule is a THREE-YEAR condition on the series, not a ceiling on the
 * displayed year, so the card carries {@link DELINQUANCE_SUPPRESSION_RULE}
 * word for word and lets the reader apply it. The compact register states that
 * same condition — `Diffusé si > 5 faits 3 ans de suite — ni zéro, ni « peu »`
 * — because the claim, not the sentence, is what may never be dropped.
 *
 * The reporting-rate line is the publisher's own too, with the publisher's own
 * two numbers: 12 % of victims of sexual violence outside the household report
 * it, against 74 % of burglary victims. Two indicators of this same layer are
 * therefore not on a comparable scale, and no sentence written here would say
 * that as unarguably as the SSMSI saying it about itself — so both registers
 * carry those two numbers.
 *
 * @param {string} slug
 * @param {{state?:?number, methodo?:boolean}} [options] `CELL_SUPPRESSED` adds
 *   the suppression rule; `methodo` selects the verbatim register.
 * @returns {string} One or more lines; the caller splits on `\n`.
