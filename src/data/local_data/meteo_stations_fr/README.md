# Where France measures the weather, and what each instrument can tell you

`stations.json` is Météo-France's whole real-time observation network — 2 144
stations — joined to what each one actually measures.

**The layer draws 190 of them: the ones that publish their readings in the
open.** The file keeps all 2 144 anyway, because the gate is a runtime boolean
(`SHOW_ONLY_PUBLISHING`) and a deployment holding a Météo-France API key flips it
to draw the whole network with this same artifact. Every count below describes
the FILE unless it says otherwise.

It exists because the globe already showed the weather three times — Open-Meteo's
conditions in the regional brief, Météo-France's weather-warning (*vigilance*)
colors per department, Vigicrues on the rivers — and never once showed **where
the numbers come from**. A weather-warning map is an interpretation of readings
taken somewhere. This is the somewhere.

Rebuild it with:

```
npm run meteo:stations                              # writes this file
npm run meteo:stations -- --report                  # and prints the per-department table
npm run meteo:stations -- --keep-fiches=/tmp/f.json # cache the 191 MB inventory between runs
```

## What is in it

Measured on the 2026-09-02 build:

- **2 144 stations**, 1 818 in mainland France and 326 overseas, from the
  tide line to the **Aiguille du Midi at 3 845 m** — the highest weather station
  in the country, with La Meije-Nivôse at 3 093 m and Bellecôte-Nivôse at
  2 992 m behind it.
- **696 in the RADOME reference pack**, quality-checked by Météo-France the
  next day (J+1), and 1 448 in the extended pack.
- **190 that publish their readings in the open**, with no API key — the ones
  the layer draws. The other 1 954 measure right now and their readings sit
  behind the Météo-France API key.
- **1 230 with a published *fiche climatologique*** (climate summary sheet) —
  the records held at that station and the period they were established over,
  fetched per card.
- Fourteen instrument booleans per station, and the class derived from them.

## The one fact this file exists to carry

**A French weather station usually is not a weather station.**

A reader expects 2 144 identical instruments, each knowing the temperature, the
wind, the pressure and the humidity. Measured against Météo-France's own
per-station parameter inventory:

| instrument | stations | | instrument | stations |
|---|---:|---|---|---:|
| screened air temperature | 2 084 | | sunshine duration | 228 |
| precipitation | 2 068 | | visibility | 211 |
| humidity | 860 | | present weather | 206 |
| wind at 10 m | **845** | | cloud cover | 186 |
| snow depth | 309 | | road-surface temperature | 149 |
| global radiation | 270 | | soil temperature | 132 |
| pressure | **234** | | sea state | 44 |

**1 254 of the 2 144 — 58 % — measure temperature and rain and nothing else.**
Only **228** measure the five parameters the phrase "weather station" means, and
only **845** can tell you which way the wind is blowing. That measurement is the
layer's palette:

| class (legend label) | count | what it can answer |
|---|---:|---|
| Full synoptic (*Synoptique complète*) | 228 | temperature, rain, wind, humidity, pressure |
| Automatic with wind (*Automatique avec vent*) | 565 | temperature, rain, wind — no pressure |
| Temperature and rain (*Température et pluie*) | 1 254 | neither wind nor pressure |
| Temperature only (*Température seule*) | 37 | a thermometer with no rain gauge |
| Rain gauge (*Pluviomètre*) | 21 | rain and nothing else |
| Other sensors (*Autres capteurs*) | 33 | neither temperature nor rain |
| Inventory not published (*Inventaire non publié*) | 6 | nothing is published about this station |

## Why the instrument list is anchored, not keyword-matched

Météo-France publishes **254 parameter names** for this network and most of them
are DERIVED statistics: `NOMBRE DE JOURS AVEC TX>=35°C`, `CUMUL DES DJU SEUIL 18
METHODE CHAUFFAGISTE`, `SOMME DES TNTXM QUOTIDIEN SUP A 8°C`.

Matching on the word "TEMPERATURE" would count a degree-day accumulator as a
thermometer. Matching on "VENT" would count `MOYENNE DECADAIRE DE LA FORCE DU
VENT` — present on **879** stations — as an anemometer, when only **845** have
one. Each family is therefore anchored on the station's own HOURLY base reading,
which exists if and only if the instrument does. A parameter carrying a
`dateFin` is a decommissioned instrument and is not read: reporting one would
put an anemometer on a mast that came down in 2011.

## Four things this file records that the publisher's own files disagree about

**The SYNOP station list names 62; the SYNOP archive contains 190.** Boulogne,
Le Touquet, Dunkerque, Dieppe, Beauvais-Tillé, Ouessant-Stiff and 123 others
write an open hourly observation the list never mentions, and every one of the
190 resolves to a station in the real-time list. It fails the other way too:
**CAP CEPET is named in the list and has written nothing all year.** So `synop`
(named) and `live` (publishing) are separate fields, and the layer counts the
second.

**Seven stations in the real-time list are closed.** MARSILLARGUES on
2026-01-01, BASSE-TERRE GUILLARD on 2026-02-11, DESHAIES GENDARMERIE on
2024-10-01, ST JOSEPH-CIRAD and TAN ROUGE-CIRAD on 2023-03-29, DEMBENI and
MAMOUDZOU_SAPC on 2025-04-01. Météo-France's own metadata says so and its own
real-time list still carries them. They are kept in the file and flagged; none
of the seven publishes, so the gate keeps all seven off the globe.

**Six stations exist in no metadata file at all.** ALBA LA ROMAINE, SOULAINES,
TARASCON, PIOGGIOLA, QUERCITELLO and MURAT SUR VEBRE. `fam` is `null` for them,
not `[]` — "nobody documented this" and "this measures nothing" are different
facts and must stay testable apart.

**The popular SYNOP mirrors died on 2026-01-15.** Every OpenDataSoft copy of
*Données SYNOP essentielles OMM* (essential WMO SYNOP data) —
`public.opendatasoft.com` and the Toulouse Métropole instance data.gouv itself
links to — stops at 2026-01-15T09:00Z,
measured 2026-09-02. Anything reading a mirror for "current French weather" has
been serving a seven-month-old reading since January.

**And Météo-France's own bucket serves that archive twice, one copy frozen.**
`data/OBS/SYNOP/synop_2026.csv.gz` was written 2026-09-14 at 07:00Z;
`data/synchro_ftp/OBS/SYNOP/synop_2026.csv.gz`, same product and same name, has
not been touched since 2026-09-09 at 05:41Z. This project read the frozen one
until 2026-09-14. Measured the same day: the product is a DAILY consolidation of
three-hourly observations — 8 rows per station per day — so even on the live
prefix the freshest keyless French reading is **11 to 35 hours old**.

## What is NOT in this file, and why

**The 12 347 closed climatological stations (*postes*).** `POSTES_MF.csv`
carries every station back to **1806** and only 2 404 are still open. A layer
of historical stations is a different layer with a different argument, and
drawing them beside live instruments would say the network is five times its
real size.

**The 699 *stations complémentaires*** (complementary stations). Type 5,
published separately, 535 of them open, run by the DGPR, the DIR road
directorates, the DREAL, EDF and INRAE. None appears in the real-time list —
verified, the intersection is empty — and Météo-France does not guarantee
their quality control.

**The Infoclimat / StatIC network.** 1 138 French stations, and **553 of them are
CC BY-NC**: more than half the file forbids commercial reuse, station by station.
Mixing it in would ship a licence trap.

**Every reading.** The observation and the records are fetched at runtime, never
bundled: 1 230 climate sheets × 6 kB is 7 MB to answer a question most readers
never ask, and a bundled temperature is wrong within the hour.

## Fields

| field | meaning |
|---|---|
| `id` | `NUM_POSTE`, 8 digits `DDCCCNNN`. The join key everywhere. |
| `omm` | WMO indicative, on 287 stations. Having one ≠ publishing. |
| `synop` | Named in Météo-France's SYNOP station list (62). |
| `live` | Actually present in the SYNOP archive (190). |
| `name`, `commune`, `place` | As published — never prettified, the name is half an identifier. |
| `lat`, `lon`, `alt` | WGS84 and metres. |
| `dep` | Two digits, or three overseas. **Corsica is `20`** — `NUM_POSTE` uses the 1976 numbering and no station carries `2A`/`2B`. |
| `pack` | `RADOME` or `ETENDU`. The publisher's own word, not a quality score. |
| `type` | Météo-France station (*poste*) type 0–4, verbatim from `POSTES_descriptif_champs`. |
| `opened`, `closed` | `YYYY-MM-DD`. `closed` non-null on the seven above. |
| `fam` | Instrument family keys, or **`null`** when no inventory exists. |
| `klass` | The class in the table above, derived from `fam`. |
| `fiche` | A *fiche climatologique* is published for this station. |

## Sources

All four are Météo-France, all under
[Licence Ouverte 2.0](https://github.com/etalab/licence-ouverte/blob/master/LO.md)
— attribution required, including the data's own date.

1. **Liste des stations du réseau d'observation temps réel** (list of the
   real-time observation network's stations), via data.gouv.fr. The spine: position, altitude, opening date, pack.
2. **Informations sur les stations — `fiches.json`** (station information),
   191 MB from Météo-France's S3. Read for one thing: the parameters each station measures today. Fourteen
   booleans per station survive; the rest is discarded. There is no smaller form
   of this file.
3. **`POSTES_MF.csv`** — municipality, locality, station type, and `DATFERM`,
   which is the only way to learn that seven live-listed stations are closed.
4. **Liste des stations SYNOP** (list of SYNOP stations) — the 62 the publisher
   says publish openly.

Plus one listing rather than a download: the S3 index of
`REF_STATION/FICHECLIM_*.data`, which says which stations have a published
climate sheet. Asking 1 578 HEAD requests to learn a boolean the index already states
would be absurd.
