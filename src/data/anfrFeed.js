/**
 * @module anfrFeed
 *
 * The reading of France's register of radio installations above 5 watts — and
 * of the one thing the register is really about, which is WHICH GENERATION
 * TRANSMITS FROM WHICH MAST.
 *
 * NAME COLLISION, NOT DATA COLLISION. This repo already has a layer called
 * `radio`. That one is `radio-browser.info` — internet audio streams, keyed by
 * a station UUID, played through an `HTMLAudioElement`. This one is physical
 * masts keyed by ANFR's `SUP_ID`. The two share a shelf in the panel and
 * nothing else: no field, no identifier, no upstream.
 *
 * ── Why the pre-joined mirror and not the canonical bulk file ────────────────
 * ANFR publishes the same facts twice. The canonical file is data.gouv
 * `551d4ff3c751df55da0cd89f` — measured 2026-09-01: HTTP 200, 453 875 bytes of
 * metadata, 276 resources, licence `lov2`, monthly, `last_update`
 * 2026-08-24T08:19:37+00:00, org *Agence nationale des fréquences* with badges
 * `public-service` and `certified`. Its newest data resource is a 66 019 086-byte
 * zip that expands to five semicolon tables, and getting a generation out of it
 * means joining SUP_SUPPORT → SUP_ANTENNE → SUP_EMETTEUR on the COMPOSITE key
 * `(STA_NM_ANFR, AER_ID)` and then classifying 68 distinct `EMR_LB_SYSTEME`
 * strings by prefix.
 *
 * That last step is where everybody gets it wrong, and it is the reason this
 * module does not do it. `GSM R` starts with `GSM`; `LTE 700 P` and
 * `LTE 2600 P` are the Réseau Radio du Futur, not a consumer network; four
 * labels end in `Expe`. A prefix rule sweeps all of them into "mobile" and
 * inflates the count by several thousand masts that are railway and
 * emergency-services infrastructure.
 *
 * The mirror has already done that exclusion, and the proof is a count: over
 * the whole 826 418-row observatoire this module measured **exactly 13 distinct
 * `emr_lb_systeme` values** — LTE 700 · LTE 1800 · UMTS 900 · LTE 800 ·
 * LTE 2100 · LTE 2600 · 5G NR 3500 · GSM 900 · 5G NR 2100 · 5G NR 700 ·
 * LTE 900 · UMTS 2100 · GSM 1800 — against 68 in the bulk file. No `GSM R`, no
 * `P` suffix, no `Expe`. The classification this layer would have had to invent
 * is one that ANFR already publishes, so the layer reads `generation` and stops
 * arguing.
 *
 * The bulk file is not wasted: its 4 805-byte REFERENCE archive is the only
 * place `nat_id` is spelled out, and this module parses that (38 rows,
 * `SUP_NATURE.txt`, 785 bytes) so a card can say `Pylône autostable` instead of
 * `23`. The observatoire dataset advertises its own `NAT_ID.txt` and
 * `TPO_ID.txt` resources with `datastore_active: true` — both return `total: 0`.
 *
 * ── Why the CSV and not the JSON datastore ──────────────────────────────────
 * Both routes serve the same 826 418 rows, keyless, no CORS on either. Measured
 * 2026-09-01 with the eleven columns below:
 *
 *   `/sites/default/files/dataset/…observatoireod_20260827.csv`
 *       181 988 412 bytes in **4.07 s** (44.7 MB/s), one static-file GET.
 *   `/d4c/api/records/2.0/search/?limit=150000&offset=0&fields=…`
 *       42 016 116 bytes in **4.74 s** for ONE of the six pages needed —
 *       ~231 MB and ~30 s for the set.
 *
 * One static GET is both five times cheaper and considerably kinder to a public
 * agency's database than six full-table scans, and the CSV URL is not a guess:
 * the D4C catalogue publishes it as `extras.file_csv`, alongside
 * `extras.records_count` — `{"88ef0887-…":"0000826418"}` — which is the
 * completeness proof, from the portal, for free. The datastore stays as the
 * cross-check (`?limit=1` returns `result.total` 826 418) and as the fallback.
 *
 * ── Trap 1: `Projet approuvé` is 8.05% of the file and is NOT a mast ────────
 * The register's `statut` has exactly three values, and this module counted all
 * three over the whole file: **En service 639 019 · Techniquement opérationnel
 * 120 891 · Projet approuvé 66 508** — 8.05%, not the ~5% a sample suggests.
 * A "projet approuvé" is an installation ANFR has authorised and nobody has
 * built. Drawing it as a transmitting site is the standard error with this
 * dataset and it is a big one: **3 638 supports (5.00% of 72 700) carry
 * NOTHING but approved projects**, and a further 15 606 live supports carry an
 * approved project on top of what they already radiate — on 3 776 of those the
 * project adds a generation the mast does not have yet.
 *
 * So a support gets three masks, not one: `svc` (systems declared *En service*),
 * `live` (in service OR technically operational — everything that radiates) and
 * `plan` (approved, not built). Colour reads `live`. `plan` is drawn as its own
 * band and never as a generation.
 *
 * The register agrees with itself about this, which is the reassuring part:
 * `emr_dt`, the in-service date, is null on **66 321 rows and every single one
 * of them is `Projet approuvé`**. A thing with no service date is a thing that
 * is not in service.
 *
 * ── Trap 2: the CSV is not the CRLF file next door ──────────────────────────
 * The bulk 5W tables are CRLF. This CSV is **LF only** — verified byte by byte
 * over all 181 988 412 of them, zero `\r`. A parser written for the bulk file
 * leaves a trailing `\r` on the last column, which is `statut`, so every
 * `=== 'En service'` comparison fails and the whole map turns into approved
 * projects. It also opens with a **UTF-8 BOM** (`EF BB BF`), so
 * `header.split(';')[0]` is `"﻿id"` and a column-index build silently
 * loses `id`.
 *
 * What it is NOT is quoting-hostile: all 826 418 rows split into exactly 22
 * fields on `;`, and the only quoted column is `coordonnees` — quoted because
 * its own separator is a comma. So a hand-rolled split is correct here, and
 * saying so is cheaper than pulling in a CSV parser that would be right for the
 * wrong reasons.
 *
 * ── Trap 3: French decimals, and a height of zero ───────────────────────────
 * `sup_nm_haut` is a STRING on every row and carries a decimal comma on
 * **243 889 of the 826 418**. `parseFloat('28,3')` returns 28 in JS — a silent
 * 1% error, never a crash. Measured over the 72 700 supports: median height
 * 30 m, 95th percentile 48 m, maximum 343.3 m, and **551 supports publish 0**.
 * Zero is not a height and is returned as null, not drawn as a mast flat on
 * the ground.
 *
 * ── The height is DENSE, and its 551 holes are a category, not a gap ────────
 * The column was read here and printed on a card long before it was drawn, so
 * the coverage had never been counted. It has now, over all 72 700 supports of
 * the 2026-08-27 edition: **72 149 publish a usable height (99.24 %) and 551
 * do not (0.76 %)**. Distribution, in metres: min 0.6 · p05 12 · p25 22.2 ·
 * **median 30** · p75 36 · p90 44 · **p95 48** · p99 64 · **max 343.3** (a
 * guyed mast). By decade: 1 620 under 10 m, 11 216 in 10–20, 20 486 in 20–30,
 * 26 461 in 30–40, 9 333 in 40–50, 2 646 in 50–75, 277 in 75–100, 110 at or
 * above 100 m.
 *
 * The 551 holes are the finding. They are not scattered across the register:
 * cross-tabulated against `nat_id`, **all 551 of them are underground or
 * indoor** — 506 `Intérieur sous-terrain`, 38 `Tunnel`, 7 `Intérieur galerie`,
 * and that is 551 of 551 exactly. The register leaves the height blank because
 * there is no mast to measure: the equipment is in a tunnel. So a support with
 * no published height is not a support whose height was forgotten, and the
 * drawing owes it a shape of its own rather than a default one.
 *
 * The frozen marks below are published from this count, once, and never
 * recomputed from whatever is on screen (C1).
 *
 * ── The AZIMUTH is not in the file this layer loads. Measured, twice ────────
 * A mobile antenna radiates into a sector, so the direction is the field worth
 * having. It is **not in the observatoire**: the CSV header was re-read byte
 * for byte on 2026-09-03 over a 601-byte range request, and it is 22 columns —
 * `id · adm_lb_nom · sup_id · emr_lb_systeme · emr_dt · sta_nm_dpt ·
 * code_insee · generation · date_maj · sta_nm_anfr · nat_id · sup_nm_haut ·
 * tpo_id · adr_lb_lieu · adr_lb_add1 · adr_lb_add2 · adr_lb_add3 · adr_nm_cp ·
 * com_cd_insee · coordonnees · coord · statut`. **No azimuth, no tilt, no
 * aperture, no power.** The bulk 5W archive has `AER_NB_AZIMUT` on
 * `SUP_ANTENNE.txt`, but importing it would mean the 66 MB join this module
 * refuses in its opening section, and it would arrive per-AER_ID with no way
 * to reach a viewport cheaply.
 *
 * Where it IS published is Cartoradio, per antenna, as `orientation` in
 * degrees — the same on-demand call this module already reads for the card.
 * Measured 2026-09-03 over 40 supports spread through the register (one every
 * 1 817 rows of the sorted pack), 138 installations and **328 antennas: 324
 * carry an orientation (98.8 %) and 4 do not**. Mounting height came with it:
 * `installations[].hauteur` was published on **138 of 138** (min 3 m, median
 * 26.4 m, max 48.3 m).
 *
 * And `orientation: 0` was cleared before it was drawn, because a zero in a
 * bearing column is the classic null-in-disguise. It is not one here: 26 of
 * the 138 installations carry a 0, **not one of them carries it alone**, and
 * 18 of the 26 are the textbook three-sector `0/120/240`. The rest are
 * `0/105/210`, `0/90/210`, `0/90/270`, `0/140/240`, `0/220`, `0/240`. Zero is
 * due north and is drawn as due north.
 *
 * So the azimuth reaches the map ONE MAST AT A TIME, on the card the reader
 * asked for, and never as a viewport channel. That is a limit of the transport
 * and it is stated rather than papered over.
 *
 * ── Trap 4: `fields=` will not accept an encoded comma ──────────────────────
 * The datastore's projection parameter takes LITERAL commas.
 * `fields=sup_id%2Cadm_lb_nom` returns **HTTP 200, 119 bytes,
 * `{"success":false,"error":{"fields":["invalid value \"sup_id%2C…\""]}}`* —
 * a 200 that is an error, which is what `URLSearchParams` produces if you let
 * it. Every helper here builds that parameter by hand.
 *
 * ── What the file cannot tell you, by statute ───────────────────────────────
 * Quoted from the canonical dataset: *"Installations radioélectriques de plus
 * de 5 watts, hormis celles de l'Aviation Civile et des ministères de la
 * Défense et de l'Intérieur."* Blank ground near a base or an airport is
 * policy, not a gap in the data, and the layer says so rather than letting a
 * reader infer coverage.
 *
 * Dependency-free and side-effect-free (no Cesium, no DOM) so it runs
 * identically in the browser, in the Vite dev-server proxy, and under
 * `node --test`.

 * outright. Every input was already being downloaded: the loop below used to
 * throw the operator→system association away into two flat sets, so a card
 * could say four operators and twelve systems without ever saying which
 * operator had which.
 *
 * `modified` is `station.modification` and is new here. It is the only change
 * signal this upstream publishes, and it separates a mast an operator last
 * touched in 2016 from one it re-filed last month — same dot, very different
 * object.
 *
 * The cost, measured on the busiest mast in the fixtures — support 449714,
 * four mobile operators, 30 antennas — for the per-operator fold plus the
 * exposure report's regulatory ceilings and band list: the whole card goes
 * from 5 153 to 6 658 bytes, **1 507 to 1 873 gzipped, +366**. That is on a
 * per-mast call made once for the mast the reader clicked, cached for a day
 * and coalesced by SUP_ID — not on the 72 700-support national pack, which
 * carries none of it.

/**
 * The per-emitter breakdown: what each operator actually radiates, and in
 * which band pair.
 *
 * This is the answer to "and what it radiates" — the frequency edges are
 * published per emitter as `{debut, fin, unite}`, and an LTE 700 emitter
 * returns two of them because the link is duplex (778–788 MHz down,
 * 723–733 MHz up). They are kept as pairs rather than summed into a bandwidth,
 * which would be a number ANFR never published.
 *
 * The newest `date_service` across every emitter comes out of the same pass;
 * the exposure readout uses it to say whether a published measurement predates
 * the equipment it would be read as measuring.
 *
 * ── The azimuths, and the two ways they can be absent ───────────────────────
 * `antennes[].orientation` is the only direction ANFR publishes anywhere this
 * layer can reach, and `installations[].hauteur` is the only mounting height.
 * Both are folded here into one list of DISTINCT (bearing, height) pairs,
 * because a three-sector site files one antenna per operator per band and a
 * busy mast returns the same three bearings a dozen times: the measured sample
 * had 328 antennas on 138 installations, and drawing one ray per antenna would
 * stack a dozen identical rays on each of three bearings.
 *
 * What is NOT folded in is a beamwidth or a range, because ANFR publishes
 * neither. A wedge would have to invent an aperture and a distance; a ray only
 * has to be pointed. So this returns bearings, and the drawing draws bearings.
 *
 * The cost is one card's worth and it is measured on the busiest mast in the
 * fixtures, support 449714 with five operators and 33 antennas: the antenna
 * projection goes from 2 424 to 3 756 bytes, **706 to 893 gzipped**. That is
 * +187 bytes on a per-mast call that is made once, cached for a day and
 * coalesced by SUP_ID — not on the 72 700-support pack, which carries none of
 * this.
 *
 * The two absences are kept apart because they mean different things:
 * `withoutAzimuth` is an antenna whose direction nobody filed (4 of 328
 * measured), and `heightM: null` on a pair is a direction that IS filed on an
 * installation whose mounting height is not (0 of 138 measured — the branch
 * exists so the drawing can mark it rather than seat the ray on a guess).
