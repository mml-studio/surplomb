/**
 * @module data/weekHourCursor
 *
 * **L'heure de la semaine type, une seule fois pour toute la carte.**
 *
 * ── The problem, counted ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Three layers in this repository draw an ARCHIVED TYPICAL WEEK rather than a
 * live measurement, and until this module each owned its own hour:
 *
 *   · `comptages-fr`   — 2 977 Paris loop arcs × 168 hours, folded by the
 *     publisher into two day-types (`comptagesRhythm.js`);
 *   · `velo-pulse-fr`  — 561 docking stations × 168 hours, Paris and Lyon;
 *   · `idfm-network` — 36 502 Île-de-France stops × 7 days × 24 bands.
 *
 * They live on THREE DIFFERENT ROWS of the panel after the 2026-09 fusion —
 * *Trafic routier*, *Vélos et véhicules partagés*, *Transports en commun* — so
 * two of them on screen at once is the normal case, and until now that case
 * drew **two different hours of the week side by side**. A reader comparing
 * the morning peak on the roads with the morning peak on the métro was, in
 * fact, comparing 08 h with whatever hour it happened to be. The map was not
 * wrong on either row; it was wrong BETWEEN them, which is the failure mode a
 * juxtaposition has and a single layer does not.
 *
 * ── What the audit thought the obstacle was, and what it actually is ────────
 *
 * The cross-referencing audit (#128) recorded this as blocked on the share grammar:
 * *"les trois encodent aujourd'hui leur heure séparément et des liens déjà
 * envoyés en dépendent"*. That turned out to be false, and checking it is what
 * made the module small. In `layerState.js`, `comptages-fr` (`cr`) and
 * `idfm-network` (`if`) are both `enabled-only` — **neither has ever put its
 * hour in a link** — and `velo-pulse-fr` (`vp`) encodes a three-value MODE
 * enum (`now` / `week` / `peak`), not an hour. So no link in the wild carries
 * an hour of the week, and there is nothing to stay compatible with.
 *
 * The decision the audit asked for is therefore the opposite of what it
 * expected: **one shared token, not three**. `wh` (below) is the first share
 * key that can express "Paris, mardi 8 h", and it belongs to the cursor rather
 * than to any layer, because the thing being shared is an hour of a typical
 * week and not a property of the roads or of the bicycles.
 *
 * ── The vocabulary, and why this module owns the translation ────────────────
 *
 * The canonical cursor is `{day, hour}`, `day` 0–6 with **Monday = 0** and
 * `hour` 0–23. Monday-first because two of the three consumers already are:
 * `IDFM_FREQ_DAYS` starts at `lundi` and `veloPulseFeed.slotForDate` returns
 * `day * 24 + hour` on the same origin. `comptages-fr` is the one that is not
 * a real day at all.
 *
 * Each layer speaks its own dialect and NONE of them imports another:
 *
 *   | layer            | its own unit           | lossless? |
 *   |------------------|------------------------|-----------|
 *   | `velo-pulse-fr`  | slot 0–167             | yes       |
 *   | `idfm-network`   | (day name, band 4–27)  | yes       |
 *   | `comptages-fr`   | (day-TYPE, hour)       | no — see below |
 *
 * **The lossy edge is named rather than hidden.** `comptages-fr` publishes a
 * mean over five weekdays and a mean over two weekend days; neither is a
 * Tuesday and neither is a Sunday, which is why that layer calls them *jour
 * ouvré type* and *week-end type*. So the cursor → comptages direction is
 * exact (Monday–Friday is the weekday profile, Saturday–Sunday the weekend
 * one) and the comptages → cursor direction has to CHOOSE a day the layer
 * never measured. It chooses by keeping the day already on the cursor when
 * that day is on the right side of the split, and only otherwise falls back to
 * {@link WEEK_HOUR_REPRESENTATIVE_DAYS}. Pressing *Sem. 08 h* while the cursor
 * sits on Wednesday therefore leaves it on Wednesday, and the other two layers
 * do not silently jump to Tuesday for a click that said nothing about the day.
 *
 * ── What this is NOT ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Not a clock (nothing here ticks, and `null` means "no reader has pinned an
 * hour" — every layer keeps its own live default), not an event bus (one key,
 * no ordering, no replay), and not a way to enable a layer: a subscriber that
 * is off hears nothing and reads the cursor when it comes on.
 *
 * Pure and module-scoped: no fetch, no DOM, no Cesium, node-testable.
