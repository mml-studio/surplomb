 * satellite base underneath can be switched off entirely.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS A LIST AND NOT `IGN_FRANCE_RECTANGLE`. A layer's rectangle is
 * its bounding box, not its coverage. The France clamp above also contains
 * Belgium, Luxembourg, northern Spain and northern Italy, where the
 * Géoplateforme answers either `<ExceptionReport>No data found` (Brussels,
 * z13) or a ~1.6 kB blank JPEG. Sleeping the base over that box would punch
 * white holes in the globe outside France.
 *
 * WHERE THESE SEVENTEEN COME FROM — `npm run qa:ign-opaque-boxes`, run
 * 2026-09-09. They are no longer hand-drawn. The script sweeps 15 554 points
 * on a 0.1° grid over the clamp (42% come back covered), erodes to points
 * whose eight neighbours are covered too, grows overlapping maximal rectangles
 * from a lattice of seeds in both axis orders, and then re-probes every
 * candidate at HALF the sweep spacing, offset by a quarter step so the probe
 * lands on midpoints the sweep itself never saw. Seven of twenty-four
 * candidates were dropped outright. The seventeen below answered real
 * orthophoto at every one of their 224-1 530 verification points — ~17 100 in
 * all, zero misses.
 *
 * TWO THINGS THAT WOULD HAVE MADE THIS WRONG, both found by re-running it:
 * thinning an over-large verification grid by halving walks the samples back
 * ONTO the sweep grid, so the biggest boxes were being "verified" against the
 * data that proposed them; and the Géoplateforme intermittently 404s tiles it
 * does serve, which had the same box scoring 1024/1024 and then 1022/1024 on
 * an identical lattice. Requiring a refusal to be repeated took the yield from
 * 8 boxes to 17 without relaxing anything.
 *
 * TWO OF THE PREVIOUS FIVE WERE NOT SAFE. Re-probed at this standard,
 * `0.5,44 -> 5,49` (the largest, and the one carrying every wide view) and
 * `4.2,43.7 -> 6,45` each contain a confirmed hole: the app has been sleeping
 * the base over views where the globe had nothing to draw. They passed their
 * original check because a 9x9 grid over a 4.5° box samples every 0.56°.
 *
 * WHAT THIS BUYS, measured with `npm run qa:world-imagery-cost`: the invisible
 * base costs 37 tiles / 813 kB per nadir Paris view against the visible IGN
 * layer's own 755 kB — the layer nobody can see costs MORE than the one they
 * came for. `cutoutRectangle` measures 37 tiles / 813 kB too, byte for byte
 * identical: it cuts the draw, not the fetch. Only `show = false` takes it to
 * zero. Coast and border are deliberately absent: there the base is genuinely
 * visible and must keep loading.
