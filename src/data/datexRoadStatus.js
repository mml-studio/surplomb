/**
 * @file DATEX II road-status feed: the pure half.
 *
 * Bison Futé publishes the state of France's non-conceded national road
 * network (`tipi.bison-fute.gouv.fr`) as DATEX II 2.0, keyless, under Licence
 * Ouverte 2.0. Two publications matter here and they answer different
 * questions about the same tarmac:
 *
 *   **TRAFICOLOR-DIR** — `trafficStatusValue` per measurement site
 *     (`freeFlow` / `heavy` / `congested` / `impossible` / `unknown`), around
 *     the sixteen agglomerations whose ring roads a DIR operates a traffic
 *     centre for. This is the colour. Measured 2026-08-31 it refreshes every
 *     60 s at Bordeaux, Toulouse, Lyon and Limoges, 120 s at Rouen and Caen,
 *     180 s in Brittany and Lorraine, 360 s at Marseille and Saint-Étienne.
 *
 *   **QTV-DIR** — `vehicleFlowRate` (veh/h) and `averageVehicleSpeed` (km/h)
 *     per counting station, one snapshot every SIX MINUTES over a six-minute
 *     window. This is the count, and TomTom has no equivalent of it at any
 *     price: a probe-derived jam factor is a ratio, not a number of vehicles.
 *
 * ── WHY THIS IS NOT A REPLACEMENT FOR THE TOMTOM FLOW LAYER ─────────────────
 *
 * It covers 936 km of segments on motorways and trunk roads only, it is blind
 * in Île-de-France (the DIRIF publishes nothing here — no station, no status,
 * no agglomeration feed), and its cadence is a minute at best. What it is, and
 * TomTom is not, is open: no key, no quota, no redistribution clause, and a
 * measured vehicle count rather than a modelled ratio. On a build with no
 * `TOMTOM_API_KEY` it is the only real congestion data the app can show.
 *
 * ── WHAT THIS MODULE IS ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Parsing, taxonomy and viewport arithmetic, Cesium-free and network-free, so
 * both the dev-server proxy (`/api/road-status-fr`, see `vite.config.js`) and
 * `roadStatusFrance.js` can share it and node:test can pin it against captured
 * bodies. The geometry it is joined to is built once, offline, by
 * `scripts/build-datex-traficolor-sites.mjs`.
 *
 * ── WHY THE XML IS SCANNED AND NOT DOM-PARSED ───────────────────────────────
 *
 * These bodies are machine-generated DATEX II with a fixed, flat shape — a
 * list of `siteMeasurements`, each carrying one site reference and one or two
 * `basicData` values — and the repository ships no XML parser. Adding one for
 * this would be a dependency to audit forever; `DOMParser` does not exist in
 * the Node half. So the payloads are scanned with anchored expressions over a
 * SIZE-BOUNDED string, no entity expansion is performed and no external entity
 * is ever resolved, which is also the only class of XML attack these documents
 * could carry. Anything that does not match is skipped, never guessed.
 *

 * The DATEX II `TrafficStatusEnum` values, as this app draws them.

 * deliberately, so that a segment coloured by a declared French state and a
 * road tinted by a TomTom flow tile would mean the same thing on screen. Only
 * half of that intention was kept: the labels drifted to `Dense` and
 * `Congestionné` while `traffic` said `Circulation ralentie` and `Circulation
 * bloquée`, and the fused row printed both vocabularies under one colour. The
 * ladder next door now holds the pair, so they cannot drift again.
 *
 * `unknown` is NOT on the ladder: it is the state the publisher explicitly
 * sends when its own sensors are down. It keeps its own grey, is counted

 * in the key rather than a fourth ink (D3).
 *

 * reported by more than one agglomeration feed: the worse state is kept,
 * because a road reported congested by one centre and free by another is not a
 * road anyone should be told is free.
