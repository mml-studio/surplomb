// src/data/cadastreFeed.js — the PCI vecteur parcel schema, and the arithmetic
// that decides what a cadastral line is allowed to claim.
//
// Everything here is pure and node-testable. The Cesium drawing lives in
// `cadastreParcels.js`; this file is where the upstream traps are held down,
// under test against a real captured Api Carto answer.
//
// ── What this data IS, before anything else ─────────────────────────────────
//
// The Plan Cadastral Informatisé is a FISCAL document. It exists so the DGFiP
// can assess property tax, and its boundaries have no legal force: in France a
// property limit is fixed by BORNAGE — a géomètre-expert's survey under article
// 646 of the Code civil — and by nothing else. A cadastral line is where the
// tax administration believes the limit runs, drawn on a plan at a published
// scale. Every card this layer renders says so, because an OSINT globe that
// draws a boundary and stays quiet about its standing is inviting the reader to
// mistake it for one.
//
// ── The six traps ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// 1. **`_limit` is capped at 5 000, and only `totalFeatures` says so.** Ask for
//    16 000 over Marseille and Api Carto answers `numberReturned: 5000` beside
//    `totalFeatures: 15977` with HTTP 200 and no warning. Worse than the count
//    being wrong: the 5 000 are not a contiguous slab — paging by `_start`
//    walks an internal order that mixes arrondissements — so a truncated answer
//    is a cadastre with SCATTERED holes, which is exactly what a complete one
//    looks like over the public domain. That is the one failure that would turn
//    this layer's headline into a lie, so a truncated box is refused whole
//    rather than drawn short (see {@link projectCadastreParcels}).
//
// 2. **`idu` does not start with `code_insee` for 38% of urban France.** The
//    identifier's first five characters are the ARRONDISSEMENT code, not the
//    commune's: a Marais parcel is `75103000AP0045` while its `code_insee` is
//    `75056`. Measured 2026-09-01 over 27 595 parcels in eight boxes: 10 588
//    mismatches, every one of them in Paris, Lyon or Marseille. Rebuild an IDU
//    from `code_insee` and the key joins to nothing in DVF for the three
//    cities where property data matters most. The published `idu` is taken
//    verbatim and never reassembled.
//
// 3. **A sheet's scale is not identified by `(commune, section, feuille)`.**
//    Lyon publishes section `AL` feuille 1 in FIVE arrondissements — 381, 382,
//    383, 385, 386 — and the 5e's copy is drawn at 1:1000 while the others are
//    at 1:500. Join without `code_arr` and a parcel gets a coin-flipped
//    tolerance, ±0.25 m or ±0.5 m. {@link sheetKey} is five parts for this
//    reason; with `code_arr` in the key there were 0 collisions across the same
//    27 595 parcels and 450 sheets.
//
// 4. **`contenance` is absent, zero, or simply different from the polygon.**
//    Mamoudzou publishes parcels with `contenance: null` (74 in one box);
//    Ostwald publishes one at exactly `0`. And where both exist they disagree:
//    7.2% of 9 539 parcels measured differ by more than 5%, 1.0% by more than
//    20%, with a Toulouse parcel drawn at 494 m² against 153 m² declared. The
//    declared figure is the fiscal contenance and the polygon is the plan;
//    neither is a survey, so the card shows BOTH and never averages them.
//
// 5. **Interior rings are courtyards, and a parcel can be in two pieces.**
//    0.5% of parcels carry a hole (the Palais-Royal's `75101000AJ0002` among
//    them) and a handful are multi-part — one identifier, two disjoint
//    polygons. Dropping either is a silent area error on the card.
//
// 6. **`section` is not always letters and `com_abs` is not always absorption.**
//    Alsace-Moselle numbers its sections (`22` in Ostwald); Marseille prefixes
//    with a digit (`0D`). And `com_abs` — the API's name for the IDU's
//    three-digit préfixe — runs 801–842 across Toulouse, a commune with no
//    arrondissements and no absorbed communes in that range. Both fields are
//    carried as opaque strings and neither is parsed for meaning.
