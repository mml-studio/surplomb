/**
 * @module ipsFeed
 *
 * The DEPP's *indice de position sociale* — read as an ATTRIBUTE of a school
 * the Annuaire already draws, never as a layer of its own.
 *
 * ── Why there is no `ips-fr` layer ──────────────────────────────────────────
 * IPS publishes no coordinate. Every one of its 43 322 rows is keyed on the
 * UAI and nothing else, so a layer would have to borrow its geometry from
 * `schools-fr` — which is another way of saying it IS `schools-fr`. The
 * register file already performs exactly this join four times over
 * (`SCHOOLS_ROLL_DATASETS` in `schoolsFeed.js`, one *effectifs* file per
 * level, all on the UAI); IPS is the fifth. It arrives as a card attribute and
 * a row readout, and it changes NEITHER of the layer's two map channels:
 * colour still means LEVEL, size still means ROLL.
 *
 * That restraint is deliberate and it is not timidity. The colour channel is
 * already spoken for, and a second meaning hidden behind a toggle would make
 * two screenshots of the same layer say different things with nothing on
 * screen to tell them apart. An index that exists to expose a gap should not
 * be the thing that makes the map ambiguous.
 *
 * ── THE HONEST HEADLINE ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Measured 2026-09-02 against the live files and the live Annuaire.
 * `schools-fr` draws 68 158 open geolocated rows over **68 083 distinct UAI**.
 * **62 857** of those can carry an index — 62 850 of a type IPS covers, plus 7
 * the register leaves untyped and the DEPP indexes anyway. Of them:
 *
 *   Ecole    48 169 drawn · 32 218 joined (66.9%) · 29 776 with a number (61.8%)
 *   Collège   9 055 drawn ·  7 042 joined (77.8%) ·  7 040 with a number (77.7%)
 *   Lycée     5 547 drawn ·  3 630 joined (65.4%) ·  3 629 with a number (65.4%)
 *   EREA         79 drawn ·     77 joined (97.5%) ·     77 with a number (97.5%)
 *   ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *   untyped      7 drawn ·      7 joined            ·      7 with a number
 *   ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *   TOTAL    62 857 drawn · 42 974 joined (68.4%) · 40 529 with a number (64.5%)
 *
 * The two columns are not the same fact and the gap between them is the point:
 * 2 445 schools ARE in the DEPP's files and still have no index, because the
 * file says so in writing (Trap 5). Coming the other way, the index holds
 * 43 322 UAI and **348 of them are not on this map at all** — closed, without a
 * coordinate, or absent from the open register: 1300023U is the Lycée Comte de
 * Foix in Andorra la Vella, and 9830313Y and 9830298G are New Caledonian, the
 * territory `schoolsFrance.js` already documents as partly uncoordinated.
 *
 * So roughly one school in three that COULD have an IPS does not have one on
 * this map, and a school with no published IPS must say so on its card. It is
 * never drawn, never coloured and never read as average. That is the whole
 * point of joining this file: an index of social position whose gaps are
 * invisible is worse than no index.
 *
 * ── Trap 1: four datasets, four DIFFERENT newest rentrées ───────────────────
 * The écoles file is a full year behind the other three. Measured from each
 * dataset's own `group_by=rentree_scolaire`:
 *
 *   fr-en-ips-ecoles-ap2022    2024-2025   32 494 rows
 *   fr-en-ips-colleges-ap2023  2025-2026    7 089 rows
 *   fr-en-ips-lycees-ap2023    2025-2026    3 662 rows
 *   fr-en-ips-erea-ap2022      2025-2026       77 rows
 *
 * A single global `max(rentree_scolaire)` returns 2025-2026 and silently drops
 * ALL 32 494 écoles — three quarters of the join, and the three quarters that
 * cover primary schooling. Each dataset therefore discovers its OWN newest
 * rentrée and is floored independently at the value this file was measured
 * against (`rentreeFloor`). A discovery older than the floor is a malformed
 * answer, not a new fact.
 *
 * The ap2022/ap2023 files are also CUMULATIVE — 97 080 école rows are three
 * school years stacked — so reading them unfiltered would triple every school
 * and average three different indices into one.
 *
 * ── Trap 2: lycées have no `ips` column at all ──────────────────────────────
 * Écoles publish `ips`. Collèges and EREA publish `ips` + `ecart_type_de_l_ips`.
 * Lycées publish **`ips_voie_gt`, `ips_voie_pro`, `ips_post_bac` and
 * `ips_etab`**, with `type_de_lycee` ∈ {LEGT, LPO, LP}. A join written against
 * `ips` drops every one of the 3 662.
 *
 * THE figure here is **`ips_etab`**, because it is the only column defined on
 * every lycée (3 661 of 3 662 — the exception is named below) and the only one
 * comparable across the three types. But it is an ESTABLISHMENT figure and the
 * card says so, then names the populations it blends, because the file
 * publishes them apart and they are far apart. Measured over the 931 LPO rows
 * that carry both voies: the median |GT − pro| gap is **18.1 IPS points**, the
 * 90th percentile 27.9, and the widest is 0312746S (lycée polyvalent
 * Marie-Louise Dissard Françoise, Toulouse) at **GT 140.1 against pro 92.4** —
 * 47.7 points inside one `ips_etab` of 126.3. Printing 126.3 alone would
 * describe neither half of that school.
 *
 * `ips_etab` is not a copy of a single voie even when only one voie is
 * published: 2 042 rows also carry `ips_post_bac`, which is folded into
 * `ips_etab` and into nothing else. 0020031Y publishes GT 97.4 and `ips_etab`
 * 95.4 for that reason.
 *
 * ── Trap 3: EREA misspells its own column ───────────────────────────────────
 * `fr-en-ips-erea-ap2022` names the establishment `nom_de_l_etablissment` —
 * no second 'e'. Every other file says `nom_de_l_etablissement`. This is not a
 * null column, it is a **whole-request failure**: a shared `select` list
 * returns HTTP 400 with
 * `ODSQL query is malformed: Unknown field: nom_de_l_etablissement.
 *  Clause(s) containing the error(s): select.`
 * (verified against the live endpoint 2026-09-02, both directions — the
 * correct spelling 400s on EREA and the misspelling 400s on the écoles file).
 * The `select` is therefore built PER DATASET from `nameField`, never shared.
 *
 * ── Trap 4: the reference values are per-type for lycées ────────────────────
 * Écoles, collèges and EREA publish `ips_national` / `ips_academique` /
 * `ips_departemental`. Lycées publish them split three ways —
 * `ips_national_legt`, `ips_national_lpo`, `ips_national_lp`, and the same for
 * académie and département. Comparing an LP to `ips_national_legt` is a wrong
 * number, and the spread between them is not small: nationally LEGT 120.2,
 * LPO 104.4, LP 89.9. So the baseline is selected from `type_de_lycee`.
 *
 * The académie baseline is fetched by nobody: a card that prints three
 * territories makes none of them the answer, and the département is the one a
 * reader of this map has in their head. The sector-split columns
 * (`_prive` / `_public`) are not fetched either — comparing a private school
 * only to private schools grades the gap on a curve, which is the one thing
 * this index exists to make visible. The card names the school's own secteur,
 * so a reader knows which population the dot belongs to.
 *
 * ── Trap 5: `NS` is a value, and `Number('NS')` is NaN ──────────────────────
 * Not in the brief, found by reading every value: the écoles file publishes
 * the literal string **`"NS"`** — *non significatif*, the DEPP's statistical
 * secrecy marker for a school with too few pupils to publish an index — in
 * **2 504 of its 32 494 rows (7.7%)**. A `Number(row.ips) || 0` turns every
 * one of them into an IPS of **0** on a scale whose measured range is
 * 54.9 – 162.7; a raw pass-through prints "NS" where a number belongs.
 *
 * They are read as a SENTINEL and reported as one: a school marked NS has
 * been examined and withheld, which is a different fact from a school the
 * DEPP never examined, and the card says which. The plausibility window
 * (`IPS_MIN_PLAUSIBLE` / `IPS_MAX_PLAUSIBLE`) catches the next sentinel that
 * happens to parse as a number.
 *
 * Two further blanks exist, both real: 2 collège rows publish `ips = null`
 * (9750025D Saint-Pierre-et-Miquelon, 0133827P Bouches-du-Rhône) and 1 lycée
 * row publishes every IPS column null (0754089M, Paris 11e). 94 collège rows
 * and 39 lycée rows publish no `ips_national` — the BASELINE itself can be
 * missing, so the comparison degrades rather than being invented.
 *
 * ── What the index costs the client, and the shape that was rejected ────────
 * Measured on the densest legal viewport in France (0.34° over Paris, 4 725
 * establishments) through the running proxy: the payload goes from
 * 2 794 171 bytes raw / 349 436 gzipped to **3 267 807 raw / 380 177 gzipped**
 * — **+473 636 raw (+17.0%) and +30 741 on the wire (+8.8%)**.
 *
 * Omitting the null keys of each record (`sentinel`, `lyceeType`, `voies` and
 * `spread` are null on most rows) was measured and rejected: it saves 131 821
 * bytes raw and **3 476 gzipped**. Three and a half kilobytes is what would
 * actually reach a reader, and the price is a record whose shape depends on
 * its contents — in a module whose entire job is to keep four kinds of absence
 * distinguishable from each other and from a value.
 *
 * The maillage carries none of this. That pack ships coordinates WITHOUT names
 * to stay at 1.66 MB against 5.42 MB, and an index per tuple would put it
 * straight back; the index rides the per-click register lookup the name
 * already pays for.
 *
 * ── Trap 6: three types for one measure, on one portal ──────────────────────
 * `ips` is TEXT in the écoles file ("119.5", and "72" for an integer),
 * DOUBLE in the collèges and EREA files (96.3), and every lycée column is
 * TEXT again ("125.1"). Same publisher, same portal, same measure. Everything
 * goes through one reader.
 *
 * Dependency-free and side-effect-free (no Cesium, no DOM) so it runs
 * identically in the browser, in the Vite dev-server proxy, and under
 * `node --test`.
