 *
 * **Une centrale, une marque** — which of three registers speaks for a site
 * they all hold, and the exact keys that decide it.
 *
 * ── The defect, counted ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Three layers draw French generating capacity and they overlap heavily.
 * Measured against the live proxies and the two bundled packs on 2026-09-09:
 *
 *   `edf-power-plants`  79 sites  — EDF's own fleet, nameplate per site
 *   `rte-generation`   108 sites  — every station ≥ 100 MW, all filières,
 *                                   171 units, and the only live output
 *   `fr-hydro-plants`  998 placed — the ODRÉ register's whole long tail
 *
 *   **69 of the 108 RTE sites are an EDF site.**
 *   **55 hydro plants are an RTE unit**, and 43 of those chain on to an EDF
 *   site as well — Grand-Maison is drawn three times.
 *
 * The cross-referencing audit (#128) recorded the deduplication as owed and called it
 * "une colonne vertébrale à écrire (choisir quelle source fait foi pour la
 * position, laquelle pour la puissance)". The spine turned out to be already
 * built, and by the repository's own build scripts.
 *
 * ── The two keys, and neither of them is a heuristic ────────────────────────
 *
 * 1. **`placementRef`, for EDF ↔ RTE.** `scripts/build-rte-units-registry.mjs`
 *    places 69 of its 108 sites on EDF's published coordinate and RECORDS WHICH
 *    ONE: `placementRef: 'edf:nucleaire:GRAVELINES'`, against the EDF layer's
 *    own site id `nucleaire:GRAVELINES`. All 69 resolve; none is ambiguous.
 *    The position question the plan asked — which source makes foi — was
 *    therefore answered at build time, in EDF's favour, and this module only
 *    has to read the answer.
 * 2. **The EIC code, for RTE ↔ hydro.** Both packs come from the same ODRÉ
 *    register and both carry it: `17W100P100P02756` is Grand-Maison's group 7
 *    in one and `G.MAIH-CENTRALE HYDRAULIQUE DE GRAND-MAISON-7` in the other.
 *    55 exact matches.
 *
 * NO PROXIMITY RULE ANYWHERE, and the measurement is why: EDF's Grand-Maison
 * (1 714 MW) sits **540 m** from the hydro register's Le Verney (21.8 MW), and
 * Super-Bissorte (742 MW) sits 410 m from Orelle (71.7 MW) and 690 m from
 * Bissorte (76 MW). Those are different works on the same mountain. A 1 km
 * identity rule would have merged 80 pairs of which several are two plants,
 * and the map would have lost real generating capacity to a tidy-looking dot.
 *
 * ── Who draws, and why that order ───────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * {@link PLANT_REGISTER_ORDER}, and it is not a ranking of the registers'
 * worth:
 *
 *   · **EDF first** because it is the row's PRIMARY after the 2026-09 fusion
 *     and because its coordinate is the one the other two borrowed — the mark
 *     that survives is the one every register agreed to stand on;
 *   · **RTE second** because it is the superset by coverage (108 against 79)
 *     and carries what neither other register has, the live output;
 *   · **the hydro register last** because its subject IS the long tail: of its
 *     998 placed plants, 55 are duplicates and 943 are the reason it exists.
 *
 * ── What withdrawal means, and what it does not ─────────────────────────────
 *
 * A layer that withdraws a site draws no mark for it. **Nothing is deleted**:
 * the record stays in its payload, its count still says what the register
 * holds, and the moment the higher layer goes off the mark comes back — the
 * offer only exists while that layer is drawing. `amenitiesFrance.js` does the
 * same thing for the médecin family, for the same reason.
 *
 * The surviving card gains what the withdrawal would otherwise have hidden:
 * the OTHER register's installed power, **when the two disagree**. Measured
 * over all 69 EDF↔RTE pairs, most do not: **43 agree to the megawatt** and 14
 * more are within 5 %, so a card that printed both figures every time would be
 * repeating itself 57 times to say something 12 times.
 *
 * And those 12 are findings rather than noise. `Flamanville` is EDF 2 660 MW
 * against RTE 4 280 — EDF's file predates the EPR and RTE counts it.
 * `Bouchain` is 585 against 1 063, because an RTE site is the sum of its units
 * ≥ 100 MW and an EDF site is one nameplate. `Brennilis` is 304 against 125.
 * By filière the split is clean: nuclear and hydro both have a median ratio of
 * ×1.000, thermal ×1.081.
 *
 * Pure: no fetch, no DOM, no Cesium. The layers do the offering.
