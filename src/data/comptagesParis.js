/**
 * @module comptagesParis
 *
 * Comptages routiers permanents (Paris) — the only layer on this globe that
 * draws a MEASURED vehicle count, on the arc of street that measured it.
 *
 * `comptagesFeed.js` holds the reading of the 27 772 889 hourly rows and every
 * trap in them; `comptagesRhythm.js` holds the reading of one street's day.
 * This file is the drawing.
 *
 * ── Why this is not the two road layers already on the globe ────────────────
 * `traffic` is TomTom flow: its own header says a keyless build runs a
 * SIMULATION — "white dots at hardcoded per-road-class speeds" — and even keyed
 * it publishes a congestion RATIO, never a number of vehicles. `road-status-fr`
 * is DATEX II from the Directions Interdépartementales des Routes, and its own
 * header says "Île-de-France has no publisher at all": Paris is a hole in it.
 * This layer fills exactly that hole with exactly what neither can supply —
 * `q`, described upstream as *"nombre de véhicules comptés pendant l'heure"*,
 * on 2 946 placed arcs and 537.5 km of Paris street, keyless and ODbL.
 *
 * ── ONE regime, and the byte count is what settles it ───────────────────────
 * `schools-fr` and `irve-fr` need three regimes and `sup-fr` needs two, because
 * a national register is either too big to ship or too big to draw. Neither is
 * true here. Every arc this layer knows about fits in a box **0.1721° by
 * 0.0896°** — 12.6 km by 10.0 km, measured off the 7 449 published vertices —
 * and the complete pack, with both 24-hour profiles on every arc, measures
 * **1 374 229 bytes raw and 305 551 gzipped**, weighed by building it. That is
 * half of what `sup-fr` already ships whole (0.62 MB) and half of the
 * `schools-fr` maillage (0.63 MB).
 *
 * So there is no choropleth, no maillage, no bbox query and no thinning: one
 * fetch, one draw, and every zoom answered from what the browser already holds.
 * The only gate is geographic — the pack is not fetched while the camera cannot
 * see Paris, because an operator looking at Tokyo should not pay 0.3 MB for a
 * city off-screen.
 *
 * ── It is J-2. The word "live" appears nowhere ──────────────────────────────
 * A nightly batch lands the day before yesterday: measured 2026-09-01T21:02Z,
 * `data_processed` = 2026-09-01T01:02:50Z while the newest reading is
 * 2026-08-30T22:00Z. So the unit drawn is not an hour, it is the last COMPLETE
 * Monday–Sunday week — 2 977 arcs × 168 hours = 500 136 rows, every arc with
 * exactly 168. Every card and the row label say *mesuré, J-2* and name the week.
 *
 * ── An HOUR CURSOR, because one average was hiding 500 136 measurements ─────
 * The pack holds 2 977 arcs x 168 hours, folded upstream into two 24-hour
 * profiles per arc — 48 published means. Until 2026-09-03 this layer painted
 * exactly ONE of them, the weekday average, and the cost of that was measured:
 * only **932 of the 1 730 counting arcs (53.9 %)** are in the same width band
 * at 18 h as they are on that average, and only **124 (7.2 %)** hold one band
 * across all 48 slots. The single number misfiled 798 streets.
 *
 * So the panel row carries seven chips — the same mechanism `idfm-network`
 * proved, transposed — and they move the map through `mean`, `clock`, and four
 * pinned (day-type x hour) slots. `comptagesRhythm.js` owns the tokens, the
 * parsing and the labels; this file owns the repaint.
 *
 * The week is ARCHIVED and the chips must not pretend otherwise. `clock` reads
 * the Paris wall clock and looks that hour up in the last complete Monday to
 * Sunday week; it is labelled "A cette heure", never "maintenant", and the row
 * label names the week AND the slot on every state (rule E1). The word "live"
 * still appears nowhere.
 *
 * ── What the colour claims, what the WIDTH claims, what the DASHES claim ─────
 * COLOUR is the RHYTHM class: nocturne, week-end, pendulaire, pointe du matin,
 * pointe du soir, continu — six hues computed by `comptagesRhythm.js` on the 48
 * published means, plus one desaturated seventh for the 36 arcs whose coverage
 * is too thin to classify. It is a qualitative variable on a hue channel (B4),
 * inside B5's ceiling, and it does NOT move with the cursor: the rhythm is a
 * property of the week, not of the hour being read.
 *
 * WIDTH is the count, and it is the ONLY channel that carries it. Five bands at
 * 100 / 250 / 500 / 1 000 veh/h, frozen (C1), read at the SELECTED slot. Before
 * this change the hue carried the same band as the width — two channels for one
 * information, which is the defect rule A3 names, and it was the only free
 * channel this layer had.
 *
 * The DASHES are the honest half, and there are now two of them:
 *   • **891 of 2 977 arcs (29.9 %)** published neither a count nor an occupancy
 *     for all 168 hours. Long dark dash, never the bottom of the width scale.
 *   • an arc that DOES count can still publish nothing in the selected slot —
 *     at most 69 of the 1 730 do (weekend 10 h), 83 arcs can ever be in that
 *     state. Short pale dash: measured street, unmeasured hour. It is not the
 *     same absence as the first and it is not drawn like it (rule A1).
 * And 356 arcs measure occupancy and never a count — a real measurement in a
 * unit the scale does not speak — which keeps its solid steel stroke off the
 * scale at every slot.
 *
 * ── Why the cursor does not rebuild a single vertex ─────────────────────────
 * A stroke width is baked into `GroundPolylineGeometry`; only `color` and `show`
 * are per-instance on a built batch (verified in the embedded Cesium source:
 * `Primitive._appendShowToShader` is applied whatever the appearance, so `show`
 * works on the dashed material batches too). Rebuilding the batches on every
 * chip would be exactly the "filter that destroys the batch" rule G2 forbids.
 *
 * So the geometry is built ONCE, per width band, and the cursor only writes
 * `show`. The cost is bounded by what `comptagesReachableBands()` proves: an arc
 * only needs an instance in the bands it can actually reach across `mean` and
 * the 48 slots. Measured on the pack — 1 712 placed counting arcs, 8 560
 * instances if all five bands were built for each, **4 970 (58.1 %) built**,
 * spread 1 230 / 1 471 / 1 288 / 711 / 270 — plus 83 hour-gap instances, 355
 * occupancy and 879 silent. **6 287 instances in 8 draw calls**, against 2 946
 * in 2 before. A chip click writes at most two `show` attributes per arc that
 * moved, and no worker runs.
 *
 * ── What is NOT drawn, and is counted instead ───────────────────────────────
 * 31 arcs have no geometry — the same 31 whose `date_debut` and `date_fin` are
 * also null, and all 31 are absent from the 3 739-row referential, which has no
 * geometry for them either. **19 of them are actively measuring**, on
 * Bd_Magenta, Bd_Malesherbes, Av_Kleber, Pl_de_la_Nation. They are named on the
 * row and never placed at a centroid.

   * readers opening the same link at different times of day, which `clock`
   * would not be.
   *
   * The legend has three blocks and it needs all three, because the map now
   * encodes two variables at once (rule D1 applies to the hue; C1 requires the
   * width cuts to be published):
   *   1. the RHYTHM classes, in colour, counted over the whole pack;
   *   2. the DÉBIT bands, in width, counted at the SELECTED slot — the swatch is
   *      a masked stroke of the real width, so the key shows the thing itself;
   *   3. the three strokes that are off the count scale.
   * Every count is tallied over the whole pack because the whole pack is drawn:
   * there is no viewport and no cap here, so `n affiché / N connu` are the same
   * number and rule A5 has nothing to declare beyond the 31 unplaced arcs the
   * row label already names.
