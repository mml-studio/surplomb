/**
 * DVF feed projection — France's register of what property actually sold for.
 *
 * WHAT THIS SOURCE IS. *Demandes de valeurs foncières*: every transaction the
 * tax administration recorded, published by Etalab in a geolocated form. It is
 * the file a French buyer opens by hand, one commune at a time, and it is the
 * only public answer to "what did the flat next door really go for".
 *
 * MEASURED against the live files on 2026-09-01, for Paris 13e (75113), 2024:
 *   - `GET files.data.gouv.fr/geo-dvf/latest/csv/2024/communes/75/75113.csv`
 *     → 200 after one redirect, **752,768 bytes**, 3,975 data rows, 40 columns,
 *       no quoted fields anywhere in the body
 *   - 1,736 distinct mutations behind those 3,975 rows
 *   - 8 rows carry no coordinate, 6 carry no `valeur_fonciere`
 *   - editions are published per year from 2021 onward
 *
 * THE TRAP THIS MODULE EXISTS FOR, AND IT IS A BIG ONE. **`valeur_fonciere`
 * belongs to the MUTATION, not to the row, and it is repeated on every row of
 * that mutation.** In the captured file, mutation `2024-1225294` — the sale of
 * one building — is spread over **179 rows**, each restating €32,000,000.
 * Summing the column yields €5.7 BILLION for a single Paris block. Dividing
 * that first row's €32,000,000 by its 25 m² flat yields €1.28 million per
 * square metre. Both numbers are catastrophic and both are what the obvious
 * code produces, so this projection groups by `id_mutation` FIRST and treats
 * the row as what it is: one lot inside a sale.
 *
 * WHY €/m² IS OFTEN `null` HERE. A price per square metre is only a comparable
 * when the sale bought exactly one dwelling. Across a 179-lot block sale the
 * ratio is an investor's yield metric, not the number a buyer is looking for,
 * and the register cannot tell us how the €32 M was split. So the ratio is
 * computed for single-dwelling mutations and left `null` otherwise. A null
 * that says "not comparable" is worth more than a number that is wrong.
 *
 * THE SECOND TRAP — WHICH COMMUNE CODE. These files are keyed per
 * ARRONDISSEMENT in Paris, Lyon and Marseille: the path is `75113.csv`, not
 * `75056.csv`. `geo.api.gouv.fr/communes?lat&lon` answers **75056** for any
 * Paris point, and so does the `commune.codeInsee` Géorisques echoes. The only
 * source measured to return `75113` is the BAN reverse geocoder's
 * `properties.citycode`, which is therefore the one this path is built from.
 *
 * THE THIRD TRAP — WHICH MEDIAN THE COLOURS DIVIDE BY. Until 2026-09-03 the map
 * coloured each sale against the median of the sales inside the SCAN RADIUS,
 * i.e. against whatever the camera was pointing at. Measured on the captured
 * fixture, inside one arrondissement: from avenue de France the local median is
 * **8 857 €/m²**, from rue de Tolbiac 1.5 km away it is **12 406 €/m²** — a
 * 40 % swing with not one row of data changed. Worse, at both of those points
 * the priciest and the cheapest sale of the sample each came out *exactly at
 * the median*, painted "average", because a median of one is that one. That is
 * the C1 violation in `docs/CARTOGRAPHY.md`: the classification was derived
 * from the visible sample.
 *
 * The ratio is still the right question — an absolute €/m² ramp paints all of
 * Paris one colour — so what changes is the DENOMINATOR, not the fraction.
 * {@link communeReference} computes the median over every mutation of the
 * commune-year editions in hand, which is exactly the set the proxy already
 * downloaded and parsed: no extra request, no extra parse, and a number that
 * does not move when the camera does. It is returned NAMED (`Paris 13e
 * Arrondissement`, `75113`) so the layer can print it in the legend and on
 * every card, because a ratio whose denominator is not written down is not a
 * measurement.
 *
 * Its one failure mode is provable rather than feared: `medianPrixM2` is null
 * only when NO mutation of the editions carries a €/m², and the sales served
 * are a subset of those same mutations — so whenever there is a sale to colour
 * there is a denominator to colour it against. The test asserts that implication
 * rather than trusting it.
 *
 * Side-effect-free: URL construction, CSV parsing and projection only, over
 * one equally side-effect-free import (`scanCells.js`, the grid arithmetic it
 * shares with the DPE). The `/api/dvf` proxy imports this; nothing in the
 * browser bundle does.

 * on disk — 183 603 occupied cells on the 150 m grid, 25 388 on the 850 m one,
 * three editions each — the counts are very skewed. On the fine grid the median
 * cell holds 2 mutations, the ninth decile 17, the ninety-ninth centile 60 and
 * the densest 385. So the breaks are spread across the UPPER range, where the
 * eye can actually separate two discs, and the bottom two classes deliberately

 * straddle two: 0.02° at Lyon spans four arrondissements and a slice of
 * Villeurbanne. So each edition set keeps its own median, every mutation is
 * divided by the median of ITS OWN commune, and what a cell carries is the
 * median of those RATIOS. A single blended denominator would paint Villeurbanne
 * against Lyon 6e's prices and call the difference a market.
 *
 * NO MINIMUM COUNT FOR A COLOUR, and that is deliberate. A cell holding one
 * priced sale is coloured by that sale's ratio, exactly as the point regime
 * colours the sale itself — the claim is identical, and the disc's AREA is what
 * says how many sales stand behind it. Adding a floor would state the count
 * twice, once in a channel that already carries it.
