// src/data/ignBilTerrain.js — SPIKE. Keyless IGN RGE ALTI terrain for France.
//
// ⚠️ DEV-ONLY, BEHIND `?ign_terrain=1`, NEVER DEFAULT. ⚠️
//
// This is a decision instrument, not a shipped feature. Its job is to answer,
// with measurements instead of opinions, whether the full terrain work is
// worth financing. What it deliberately does NOT do is the reason it must stay
// behind a flag:
//
//   The repo's height-datum contract has exactly TWO surface regimes
//   (`surfaceRegimeKey()`, src/data/cctv.js): `google-3d` when the globe is
//   hidden, `terrain-globe` otherwise — and `terrain-globe` MEANS "the Re:Earth
//   point-height prior IS the ground". Installing a different terrain provider
//   under a shown globe breaks that identity everywhere heights are cached
//   from it: `groundFloor`, `meshFloorSampler`, `cctv`, `localGeojson.js`
//   (which latches `groundSampled = true` permanently) and `traffic.js` (which
//   precomputes a whole road network from ONE sample). With this flag on,
//   ground-clamped objects are WRONG. That is expected, and it is why the flag
//   exists rather than a stack.
//
// ── What the live service actually does, measured 2026-08-28 ────────────────
//
// Layer `ELEVATION.ELEVATIONGRIDCOVERAGE.HIGHRES` (MNT from RGE ALTI), WMTS
// `GetTile`, `image/x-bil;bits=32`, TileMatrixSet `WGS84G` levels 6-14.
//
//   · `WGS84G` is bit-for-bit Cesium's default `GeographicTilingScheme`:
//     2x1 tiles at level 0, origin top-left -180/+90, 256 px tiles. Confirmed
//     against the live GetCapabilities. So tile (x, y, level) maps 1:1.
//   · Samples are LITTLE-ENDIAN float32, 256x256 = 262144 bytes.
//   · The service replies `content-encoding: deflate` and the browser decodes
//     it transparently. `content-length` is therefore the COMPRESSED size
//     (189626 for a Paris tile) — a guard comparing it to the expected byte
//     count would reject every valid tile. Validate `arrayBuffer.byteLength`.
//   · Row 0 is NORTH. Verified twice: the Mont Blanc tile falls 4560 m -> 4020 m
//     from first row to last across a tile whose north edge holds the summit,
//     and a Nice tile has land in row 0 and open sea in row 255. That is
//     Cesium's own convention, so no vertical flip.
//   · Outside coverage the reply is HTTP 404 with a 137-byte XML body.
//     `137 % 4 === 1`, so `new Float32Array(buffer)` THROWS on it. The guard is
//     fail-closed for exactly this reason.
//
// ── The two findings that shaped this code ─────────────────────────────────
//
// 1. NoData is a SMEAR, not a sentinel. The documented value is -99999, but a
//    Nice coastal tile at z14 holds only 4143 samples exactly equal to it,
//    ~6500 more within half a metre of it, and a continuous ramp of 505 further
//    values — -1046, -3588, -17466, -50806 — produced by lossy resampling
//    BLENDING real heights against the sentinel. They form a one-pixel ring
//    around every NoData region. `value === -99999` would pass a -50806 m
//    crater straight through, and so would any "is it finite" check. The rule
//    here is therefore a PLAUSIBILITY FLOOR, applied per sample.
//
//    Measured residual after the floor, on the worst tile found: 14 samples of
//    65536 survive in (-100, 0) m, the lowest at -17.2 m. A ~17 m dimple on
//    0.02 % of a coastal tile, against a 100 km crater. That is the v1 trade,
//    and it is stated rather than hidden.
//
// 2. The grid is CELL-CENTRE registered; Cesium's is EDGE-INCLUSIVE. IGN gives
//    256 cell centres spanning the tile, so a tile's last column and its east
//    neighbour's first column are one full cell apart. Cesium's
//    `HeightmapTessellator` places sample i at `west + i * extent / (width - 1)`
//    — first and last samples exactly ON the edges. Feeding the raw grid
//    straight in leaves a visible crack at every tile boundary: measured
//    2.80 m mean / 5.79 m max on an Alpine z14 pair, which is a full sample
//    step, not a rounding error.
//
//    `resampleToEdgeInclusive()` below fixes it by bilinearly resampling onto
//    the grid Cesium expects and LINEARLY EXTRAPOLATING the half cell past each
//    border, rather than clamping (clamping reproduces the full-cell step).
//    Same Alpine pair after the resample: 0.03 m mean / 0.39 m max east-west,
//    0.09 m / 0.81 m north-south — sub-metre, ~35x better, invisible.

 *
 *   `false`     — "no data at this tile, UPSAMPLE THE PARENT". Used above z14
