/**
 * USGS earthquakes — last 24 hours, M2.5+, drawn as a 3D phenomenon.
 *
 * ── What this draws ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 *   · a POINT at the epicentre, clamped to the ground, whose diameter is in
 *     CONSTANT SCREEN PIXELS and carries the MAGNITUDE;
 *   · a vertical LINE rising from that epicentre whose length, in world
 *     metres at 1:1, is the FOCAL DEPTH — an inverted depth ruler, not the
 *     position of the focus (see "why the ruler points up");
 *   · one COLOUR shared by the point and its ruler, carrying the AGE of the
 *     event inside the 24 h window (A2).
 *
 * ── What it replaced, and why ───────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Until this rewrite the layer drew one CLAMP_TO_GROUND ellipse per event of
 * radius `2^magnitude × 1000` metres, tinted red / orange / yellow by depth
 * band. Two faults, both named in the representation audit (#78):
 *
 * (1) THE RADIUS MEASURED NOTHING. `2^M × 1000 m` is not the rupture area, not
 *     the felt radius, not an isoseismal, not a ShakeMap contour. It is a
 *     decorative exponential wearing the costume of a measurement: 5.6 km at
 *     M2.5, 128 km at M7, 512 km at M9. A reader saw a footprint and there was
 *     no footprint. Worse, it was drawn in WORLD units, so the mark also broke
 *     B2 — screen size on a globe is already spent on depth, and a distant M7
 *     could render smaller than a nearby M3 under a legend claiming otherwise.
 *
 * (2) DEPTH — a continuous quantitative variable — WAS ENCODED IN HUE, red →
 *     orange → yellow. B4: « la teinte n'ordonne pas ». That ramp reads as a
 *     SEVERITY scale, so a 600 km-deep event, whose depth is the single
 *     remarkable thing about it, was painted yellow and therefore "mild".
 *
 * ── A3 · what each channel carried, and what it carries now ────────────────
 *
 *   | channel        | before                    | now                        |
 *   |----------------|---------------------------|----------------------------|
 *   | world radius   | 2^magnitude (meaningless) | not used                   |
 *   | hue            | depth band                | AGE in the 24 h window     |
 *   | fill alpha     | M5+ emphasis (redundant)  | constant                   |
 *   | outline width  | M5+ emphasis (redundant)  | constant                   |
 *   | screen pixels  | not used                  | MAGNITUDE                  |
 *   | world height   | not used                  | DEPTH, 1:1                 |
 *
 * The M5+ emphasis was a second, coarser copy of the magnitude channel; with
 * magnitude now on a continuous pixel scale it is deleted rather than kept
 * "for punch". Alpha and outline width are constants and say nothing.
 *
 * ── Magnitude → pixels: the relation, and why this one ─────────────────────
 *
 * `pixelSize = 6 + 3 × (M − 2.5)`, clamped to the frozen domain M2.5…M9.5
 * (C1 — the feed floor and the largest instrumentally recorded earthquake,
 * Valdivia 1960 at Mw 9.5). So M2.5 → 6 px, M5 → 13.5 px, M7 → 19.5 px,
 * M9 → 25.5 px, and every whole magnitude step is the same 3 px step.
 *
 * The two alternatives were rejected with arithmetic, not taste:
 *
 *   · AREA ∝ ENERGY, the Bertin proportional circle applied to what the event
 *     actually released. Mw = ⅔·log₁₀(M₀) − 6.06, so one magnitude unit is
 *     ×31.6 of seismic moment and the diameter would go as 10^(0.75·M): from
 *     M2.5 to M9 that is a factor 10^4.875 ≈ 75 000. A 6 px M2.5 makes a
 *     450 000 px M9. Undrawable, so unusable.
 *   · AREA ∝ MAGNITUDE, treating the published number as if it were a count.
 *     Diameter would go as √M: M9 would be 1.9× the diameter of M2.5. The most
 *     important event on the map would be twice a background tremor. Under-
 *     stating by 4 decimal orders is not more honest than overstating.
 *
 * A diameter LINEAR IN MAGNITUDE encodes the number the feed publishes and the
 * number the reader has heard on the radio, and it puts equal magnitude steps
 * at equal pixel steps — which is exactly how the scale is quoted. The key says
 * so in six words and the card of any event says it again with that event's own
 * numbers: the mark measures the MAGNITUDE, not the energy. An M7 disc is 3.25×
 * the M2.5 disc across while releasing about 5.6 million times the energy, and
 * that gap belongs written down, not hidden in a radius.
 *
 * Pixels, not metres: `PointGraphics.pixelSize` is constant on screen and is
 * never composed with `scaleByDistance` here (B2). Deliberately no
 * `scaleByDistance`, no `translucencyByDistance`, no `distanceDisplayCondition`
 * on the mark — any of the three would multiply the thematic size by a
 * function of range and reintroduce the inversion this rewrite removes.
 *
 * ── Depth → a vertical ruler, and why it points UP ─────────────────────────
 *
 * A focus IS below its epicentre and a globe CAN draw it there, so the first
 * design put the stem underground. It cannot be made honest, and the reason is
 * that the globe is opaque. Three options were built and looked at in a real
 * browser (Chromium, dev server, live USGS feed, 2026-09-03):
 *
 *   (a) STEM UNDERGROUND WITH `disableDepthTestDistance`. Built and looked at.
 *       It draws THROUGH THE PLANET, and the size of that lie was counted
 *       rather than guessed: parked over the antipode of the day's deepest
 *       event (Fiji, 581 km), 26 of the 28 M2.5+ events were on the FAR
 *       hemisphere and all 26 projected inside the 1440×900 viewport. With the
 *       depth test defeated the frame therefore shows 28 marks of which 26 are
 *       phantoms — verified on screen, with Fijian and Tongan events painted
 *       over Mali, Niger, Türkiye and the United Kingdom. That is the X-ray
 *       image F1 forbids, and a hemisphere the reader is not looking at
 *       leaking into the one they are.
 *       A second failure, subtler and worse, showed up in the grazing view: an
 *       underground stem drawn with `depthFailMaterial` projects into exactly
 *       the same screen direction as a line lying FLAT on the water running
 *       toward the camera. Seen from above, "down" and "toward me" are the
 *       same pixels. The sign cannot mean depth even when the reader is
 *       willing to believe it does.
 *   (b) STEM UNDERGROUND WITH `scene.globe.translucency`. Measured for the
 *       record before being rejected. `frontFaceAlpha = 0.45`, same camera,
 *       same live feed, took the WHOLE SCENE from a 0.30 ms median
 *       `scene.render()` to 1.30–2.40 ms median and 3.50–7.30 ms p90 across
 *       two runs — a factor of four to eight, paid by every other enabled
 *       layer, for one layer's symbology. And the scope objection stands on
 *       its own: `scene.globe` is a GLOBAL object owned by no layer, and
 *       turning the planet transparent repaints every other reading on the
 *       map. One layer's symbology may not redefine the planet.
 *   (c) THE RULER ABOVE THE SURFACE — chosen. The line rises from the
 *       epicentre and its LENGTH is the depth, at 1:1. It is a declared
 *       reading device, not a position claim, and the legend says exactly
 *       that: « la tige monte, le foyer descend ». A1 is satisfied because the
 *       sign asserts no position that was not measured — the only position it
 *       asserts is the epicentre, which IS measured, and the only length it
 *       asserts is the depth, which IS measured. At the antipode nothing from
 *       the far hemisphere appears at all: the two marks genuinely in view are
 *       the two marks drawn.
 *
 * 1:1 and not exaggerated, which self-scales rather well. Seen on screen on
 * the live feed, on the Fiji event at 581 km and its 145 km neighbour:
 *
 *   · 1 400 km slant range, 40° pitch — the 581 km ruler runs off the top of
 *     the frame while the 145 km one is about a third of its height. The two
 *     depths are read against each other in one glance, which is the whole
 *     point and is what the old three colour bands could never do.
 *   · 900 km range, 4° pitch (horizon view) — both rulers stand vertically
 *     against the sky, unambiguous, and the epicentre marks sit on the limb.
 *   · 40 km regional altitude — a 10 km ruler is the tall object in frame.
 *
 * The one honest limit, and it is inherent to any vertical encoding on a
 * globe: AT NADIR A VERTICAL LINE HAS NO SCREEN LENGTH. Straight down over the
 * Fiji event from 14 000 km, the 581 km ruler is foreshortened to nothing and
 * only the magnitude marks read. The ruler's legibility is a function of
 * camera PITCH, not of altitude, and the reader tilts to read depth exactly as
 * they would to read any prism on this globe. That is stated rather than
 * papered over with a billboard.
 *
 * An exaggeration factor would have had to be published, defended and
 * remembered; 1:1 needs none of that, and it keeps the ruler measurable
 * against the anchored ground scale (F2).
 *
 * DATUM, stated because it is a real approximation. USGS publishes depth below
 * sea level, and the ruler's foot is placed on the WGS84 ellipsoid (h = 0),
 * not on the terrain: the anchor and the measurement then share one datum, and
 * two readers of the same share link get the same ruler. The cost is that over
 * relief the first kilometres of the ruler are inside the mountain — up to
 * ~8.8 km at the extreme, more usually a few hundred metres — so the VISIBLE
 * ruler under-reads by the local elevation. It is not corrected by sampling
 * terrain: `globe.getHeight()` answers from whatever tiles happen to be
 * loaded, which would make the same event draw a different length in two
 * sessions. A deterministic small error beats a non-reproducible small
 * correction. The epicentre point is CLAMP_TO_GROUND, so it always sits on the
 * visible surface and the ruler emerges exactly from it.
 *
 * ── Colour → age, freed by the geometry (A2) ───────────────────────────────
 *
 * Four frozen bands — ≤1 h, 1–6 h, 6–12 h, 12–24 h — on a single warm hue
 * varying in VALUE, so the order survives greyscale as B4 demands. Measured
 * sRGB relative luminance: 0.891 → 0.603 → 0.320 → 0.105, strictly decreasing,
 * every neighbouring pair separated by a factor ≥ 1.5. An event twenty minutes
 * old and one twenty-three hours old are now different marks without opening
 * anything.
 *
 * The bands are DOMAIN thresholds (C1): they are hours, not quantiles, they are
 * never recomputed from the current feed or the current view, and the same
 * event reads the same in two sessions.
 *
 * ── A1 · the three fallbacks, all visible, all counted ─────────────────────
 *
 *   · AGE NOT PUBLISHED (no `time`, or a timestamp more than 5 min in the
 *     future, i.e. a clock nobody can trust): slate `#7f8c99`, off the warm
 *     ramp entirely, with its own legend row and count. Its greyscale
 *     luminance (0.256) does sit between the 6–12 h and 12–24 h bands, and
 *     that is accepted rather than fixed: « non publié » is a NOMINAL state,
 *     not a rank on the ordered scale, and B4 gives hue exactly that job —
 *     hue differentiates, value orders.
 *   · DEPTH NOT PUBLISHED: no ruler at all, and the point is drawn HOLLOW —
 *     transparent fill, coloured ring. A missing ruler alone would be
 *     ambiguous with a shallow one, so the shape carries the distinction and
 *     the legend counts the row.
 *   · DEPTH MEASURED AT OR ABOVE SEA LEVEL (USGS publishes 0.0 km, and
 *     negative depths for shallow and induced events): a floor ruler of 1 km
 *     is drawn, because « mesuré à zéro » must not render as « non mesuré ».
 *     Same argument as `choroplethPrism`'s 1 px baseline, same legend row.
 *
 * ── A5 · what is clipped ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Every event above M2.5 in the feed is DRAWN. What is capped is the floating
 * magnitude LABEL: {@link EARTHQUAKE_OVERLAY_COHORT_LIMIT} of them, selected
 * by descending magnitude with the event id as tie-break
 * ({@link selectEarthquakeOverlayCohort}). The key publishes
 * « n étiquettes / N séismes » and the criterion, in its `note` slot, whenever
 * the cap bites.
 *
 * ── D1 · what the key answers, and what the card answers ───────────────────
 *
 * The key used to hold both — a numbered tick for each of four magnitudes,
 * another four for depth, and four titled paragraphs of caveat. Measured in
 * Chrome at 1440×900 on the live feed of 2026-09-10 (29 events, this layer
 * alone), that key was 827 px of content inside the 216 px window the rail
 * gives it: THREE QUARTERS OF IT WAS SCROLLED OUT OF SIGHT of the map it
 * exists to key. It is now 215 px, so on that feed it fits without scrolling
 * at all — 31 lines and 375 words become 11 and 93. The split runs along the
 * line CARTOGRAPHY D1 draws:
 *
 *   · THE KEY answers « what does this colour mean », because that is the one
 *     question no shape answers by itself, and it publishes the DOMAIN of the
 *     two channels that are shapes — M2.5…M9.5 and 0…700 km. That is what
 *     #141 did to the buoy scale and #166 to the road ladder: a graduated
 *     ruler of one ink whose rows differ only in size is not a key, it is the
 *     mark reprinted n times, and one line stating its bounds replaces it.
 *   · THE CARD answers « what is THIS event », on click, in the words of
 *     someone who has never read a seismology page: how hard it shook, where,
 *     when, how deep.
 *
 * The A1 fallbacks split the same way. « profondeur non publiée » keeps its
 * key row, because a hollow ring is a shape a reader decodes WRONG without a
 * key — they read it as a small event. « tige plancher » and the label cap do
 * not: neither is visible on the map as anything, both are disclosures, and
 * disclosures have their own slot (`note`) under the classes they qualify.
 *
 * ── D3 · the card stopped explaining its own rendering ─────────────────────
 *
 * The card shipped by #175 opened on « 13,2 px : la magnitude, pas l’énergie —
 * +1 sur l’échelle vaut ×31,6 d’énergie », closed on « us7000th81 », and told
 * the reader between the two that « la tige porte cette longueur VERS LE
 * HAUT ». Three of its six lines were about the MARK. A reader who clicks a
 * dot is asking about an earthquake, not about a disc: the pixel diameter of
 * the thing they just clicked is the one fact they can already see, the USGS
 * event id is an opaque string with nowhere to paste it, and the ruler's
 * direction is a property of the drawing.
 *
 * None of that is lost, because none of it was ever the card's to hold: the
 * key already publishes « Ni énergie, ni emprise » under the magnitude row and
 * « À l’échelle 1:1, et vers le haut » under the depth row, `buildEarthquakeNote`
 * already carries the 1 km floor rupture, and the event id still travels as the
 * overlay entry's own `id` (`earthquake-card:us7000th81`). What the card prints
 * now is what only the card can say about THIS event, plus the two things that
 * turn a number into a fact for a reader who does not know the scale:
 *
 *   · A PLAIN-LANGUAGE CLASS for the magnitude ({@link EARTHQUAKE_MAGNITUDE_CLASSES})
 *     and one sentence of what that class does at the surface. « M4,9 » is a
 *     number no one outside the field can place; « secousse modérée — ressentie
 *     sur place, dégâts rares » is the same measurement, decoded.
 *   · A GAUGE ({@link magnitudeGauge}) spanning the layer's own frozen domain,
 *     M2.5…M9.5, so the card and the key agree on where the scale stops. Full
 *     cells filled against empty ones, never the `▁▂▃▄` ramp `sparkline.js`
 *     owns: bars of differing HEIGHT mean a series over time everywhere else
 *     in this repo, and one magnitude is not a series.
 *
 * The depth line keeps the datum wording it had — « sous le niveau de la mer »,
 * signed, never a double negative — and trades the ruler's direction for the
 * one thing depth changes for a reader: shallow shakes harder
 * ({@link EARTHQUAKE_DEPTH_CLASSES}, the 70/300 km boundaries seismology uses).
 *
 * The clock moved from UTC to the READER's local day, against the D2 argument
 * below that two readers of one share link must read the same card. D2 loses
 * here: « 2026-09-13 19:41 UTC » is unreadable at a glance for the audience
 * this fork is in French for, and the ambiguity it trades into — whose evening
 * is 21 h 41 — is closed by naming the clock on the line (« chez vous »)
 * instead of by making everyone read Zulu.
 *
 * ── F1 · occlusion policy: regime (a), occluded ────────────────────────────
 *
 * Point and ruler both keep the depth test. Behind a mountain or a
 * photorealistic building they disappear, like anything else in the world.
 * Nothing here is drawn as "guessed", because nothing here needs to be.
 *
 * ── Performance ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The pin inherited from the 2026-08-20 hunt still holds and still matters:
 * axes/geometry are STATIC, redefined only when a poll brings new data, and a
 * `CallbackProperty` must never come back. Measured then, parked camera over
 * SF at 40 km, on the shipped 58-event feed:
 *
 *   58 clamped discs, callback axes → 32.4 ms/frame, 30 fps
 *   58 clamped discs, static axes   →  1.4 ms/frame, 60 fps
 *
 * The new geometry costs less than that, by construction and by measurement.
 * By construction: the CLAMP_TO_GROUND ellipses were N ground primitives, each
 * needing a classification pass against terrain and tiles; they are gone. What
 * replaces them BATCHES — N points collapse into one `PointPrimitiveCollection`
 * and N rulers into one `PolylineCollection` — so the draw-call count stops
 * growing with the feed.
 *
 * By measurement, 2026-09-03, headless Chromium on the dev server, camera
 * parked obliquely over the Atlantic, a SYNTHETIC 600-event feed (21× the 28
 * events the live feed carried that day), `scene.render()` + `gl.finish()`,
 * 120 timed frames per run, layer toggled ON/OFF three times to cancel drift:
 *
 *   600 points + 600 rulers ON → 1.00 ms median  (p10 0.70 / p90 1.60)
 *   layer OFF                  → 0.80 ms median  (p10 0.50 / p90 1.40)
 *
 * i.e. +0.20 ms at 600 events, which is inside this rig's own noise: the
 * difference between two consecutive OFF runs was 0.50 ms. On the live 28-event
 * feed the layer is not measurable at all. The number to distrust is the
 * absolute one — this is a software rasteriser (SwiftShader), not the GPU a
 * reader has — but the SHAPE holds: the cost does not scale with the feed, and
 * it never approaches the 32.4 ms the callback axes used to cost.
 *
 * Nothing is per-frame. The AGE colour is the one thing here that changes with
 * the clock, and it is rebanded ON POLL — every 60 s — not per frame: the
 * narrowest band is one hour, so a band boundary is crossed at worst 60 polls
 * late by 60 s, i.e. 1.7 % of the narrowest band. Paying 60 fps to sharpen
 * that would be the exact trade the 2026-08-20 hunt refused. With no per-frame
 * animator the layer still holds no continuous-render lock; the manager's
 * `layer-tick` / `layer-visibility` requests cover every mutation it makes.
