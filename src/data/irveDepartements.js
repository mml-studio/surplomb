/**
 * National IRVE rollup — the 231 079 charge points folded onto the 96
 * département polygons, so the layer has something to say at national altitude
 * that is neither nothing nor 40 000 overlapping dots.
 *
 * ── Why a choropleth, and why départements ──────────────────────────────────
 * This is the technique `franceEnergy.js` and `meteoFranceVigilance.js` already
 * use, on the same bundled geometry: a scalar per département painted onto
 * shapes that are already in the bundle (IGN ADMIN EXPRESS via france-geojson,
 * `local_data/france_departements/`). Nothing new is downloaded to draw it, and
 * a reader who has seen Vigilance knows how to read it.
 *
 * ── Why the rollup cannot come from the file's own columns ──────────────────
 * `bornes-irve` HAS a `departement` and a `region` column. Both are **null on
 * all 231 079 rows** (measured 2026-08-27) — they exist in the schema and were
 * never filled. `code_insee_commune` is present on 165 245 rows (71.5%) and
 * `consolidated_code_postal` on 133 307 (57.7%), so neither can carry a
 * national total either. The département is therefore resolved from the
 * COORDINATE, by point-in-polygon against the bundled shapes — the only field
 * this dataset fills for every row.
 *
 * ── The trap that makes the sweep non-obvious: truncation is silent ─────────
 * Opendatasoft caps an aggregated query at `offset + limit <= 30000` and,
 * past it, **returns exactly `limit` rows with HTTP 200 and no error field**.
 * Measured: the whole dataset grouped at `limit=20000` comes back 200 OK with
 * 20 000 rows summing to 71 125 of 231 079 charge points. A national map built
 * on that would draw a third of France and look completely plausible.
 *
 * So the sweep is adaptive and self-verifying, twice over: a latitude stripe
 * whose result length REACHES the limit is presumed truncated and split in
 * half, and the assembled total is checked against the dataset's own
 * `total_count` at the end. Neither check alone is enough — the first cannot
 * see a stripe that truncated at exactly `limit - 1`, and the second cannot say
 * where the loss was.
 *
 * ── What the map shows, and what it deliberately does not ───────────────────
 * TWO scalars, on two channels: the number of charge points as the HEIGHT of
 * an extruded prism, and the density per 1 000 km² as its COLOUR. This
 * paragraph used to argue the opposite, and the argument is worth keeping in
 * view because its measurement was right and its conclusion was wrong.
 *
 * It weighed "absolute count" against "density", kept the count, and rejected
 * the density because it spans a factor of 2 254 — 43.7 charge points per
 * 1 000 km² in Lozère against 98 509.6 in Paris, which is 104 km² (re-measured
 * 2026-09-03 on the live register, 227 007 charge points; the 2026-08-27 figures
 * were 43.9 and 101 785) — and therefore "leaves 95 départements
 * indistinguishable". Two things are wrong with that.
 *
 * First, indistinguishability is a property of an EQUAL-INTERVAL ramp, not of
 * the density. Cut 43.7 → 98 509.6 into six equal steps of 16 411 and the
 * occupancy is 94 · 1 · 0 · 0 · 0 · 1: ninety-four départements in one class,
 * three classes nobody can ever be in. Cut the same numbers on a GEOMETRIC
 * ladder — 100 / 250 / 500 / 1 000 / 2 500 per 1 000 km², each step a doubling
 * or a two-and-a-half — and the occupancy is 11 · 27 · 28 · 19 · 7 · 4. Every
 * class is inhabited, and the top one holds exactly the four inner-Paris
 * départements (75, 92, 93, 94) that made the range look hopeless. The old
 * sentence measured a bad discretisation and blamed the variable.
 *
 * Second, the count was never allowed on a fill at all. It is an ABSOLUTE, and
 * the corpus names painting one in flat colour « l'une des erreurs
 * sémiologiques les plus courantes que l'on peut rencontrer sur le géoweb »
 * (CARTOGRAPHY B1). The right answer was never one of the two variables — it
 * was both, on two channels, which a globe has and a sheet of paper does not.
 * See `choroplethPrism.js` for the shared grammar and its calibration, and
 * `irveFrance.js` for this layer's frozen scale.
 *
 * Density IS computed here — from the polygons' own spherical area, so it
 * needs no second dataset — and it was already on the card before it was ever
 * drawn. It is now the one thing the colour says, and the card keeps printing
 * it so a reader can read the exact figure behind the class.
 *
 * ── What this rollup therefore stopped computing ────────────────────────────
 * The six count QUANTILES. They existed only to feed the flat fill, and they
 * were computed from the rows in hand on every refresh: a sweep that lost a
 * stripe silently moved every class boundary, so the same département could
 * change colour between two loads with no change in the data. That is the C1
 * fault the prism removes by construction — its colour ladder is a frozen
 * literal published in `irveFrance.js`, never derived from a payload.
 * `irveCountBins` / `irveCountBin` stay exported and stay under test: they are
 * this module's named surface onto the shared quantile helpers, and the fact
 * that this layer no longer paints with them is not a reason to unpublish them
 * for the ones that might.
 *
 * ── What is not painted ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The bundled polygons are the 96 metropolitan départements including Corse.
 * There are no DOM shapes, so Guadeloupe, Martinique, Guyane, La Réunion and
 * Mayotte are counted as `unassigned` and reported as a number rather than
 * folded into a neighbour or silently dropped — the same rule the Mix élec
 * layer applies to Corse, in the other direction. The file's foreign stations
 * (Belgium, Luxembourg, Germany) land in the same bucket.
 *
 * ── One thing the map moves, and says it moved ──────────────────────────────
 * Those shapes are the SIMPLIFIED outlines, so a point on a real coastline can
 * fall in the sea: 886 charge points do, including the centre of Ajaccio. Any
 * point that misses every polygon but lies within `IRVE_COAST_SNAP_KM` of one
 * is counted there, and counted again in `pdcSnapped` — see that constant for
 * where the 2 km came from, and why it cannot reach Belgium.
 *
 * Dependency-free and side-effect-free (no Cesium, no DOM) so it runs
 * identically in the browser, in the Vite dev-server proxy, and under
 * `node --test`.
