/**
 * @module data/arcepFeed
 *
 * **Ma connexion internet** — what a fixed line at this address can actually
 * carry, from the ARCEP's own quarterly register.
 *
 * This is the one Cityscan theme where the fork was at zero. *Numérique* is
 * one of their ten, and everything this repository knew about connectivity was
 * ANFR's mast register — where the transmitters are, which is a different
 * question from what arrives at the door.
 *
 * ── The register, measured on 2026-09-08 against the live files ─────────────
 * `data.arcep.fr/fixe/maconnexioninternet/statistiques/last/commune/` serves
 * eight commune-level CSVs, edition **2026-03-31** (published quarterly),
 * UTF-8, semicolon-delimited, no key, no CORS obstacle. 34 877 communes —
 * Mayotte (976), Saint-Barthélemy (977) and Saint-Martin (978) included, which
 * is wider than the carte des loyers' own scope.
 *
 * Nationally, over **45 073 653 locaux**:
 *
 *   fibre (FTTH) éligible            42 277 843   93,8 %
 *   câble coaxial                     8 125 469   18,0 %
 *   cuivre encore raccordable        23 304 640   51,7 %
 *
 * ── THE TRAP THAT DECIDES WHICH FILE THIS MODULE READS ──────────────────────
 * `commune_debit.csv` says **100,0 % of French premises are eligible for
 * 30 Mbit/s**, and 100,0 % for 100 Mbit/s. That figure is true and it is
 * useless: it counts **satellite**, which is available essentially everywhere
 * and is not what anyone means by "the connection at this address".
 *
 * The ARCEP publishes the same table three times, and the three disagree by
 * exactly that:
 *
 *                       inéligible HD   ≥30 Mbit/s   ≥100 Mbit/s   ≥1 Gbit/s
 *   commune_debit            0,0 %        100,0 %      100,0 %       94,3 %
 *   …_debit_terrestre        0,0 %         99,9 %       94,5 %       94,3 %
 *   …_debit_filaire          1,7 %         95,4 %       94,5 %       94,3 %
 *
 * **This module reads `filaire`** — wired only, no satellite, no fixed 4G —
 * because that is the question a reader is asking, and because the difference
 * between 100 % and 95,4 % is 2,1 million premises that have no wired
 * high-speed line at all. A layer that published the 100 % would be repeating
 * a statistic that is technically correct and editorially false.
 *
 * ── The one file where each local is counted exactly once ───────────────────
 * The eligibility columns OVERLAP: a Paris local is counted under fibre AND
 * coax AND copper AND satellite, so they cannot be added up, and a card built
 * on them cannot say "how many people here have nothing better than copper".
 *
 * `commune_meilleure_techno_thd.csv` answers exactly that — each local under
 * its BEST available technology — and it partitions cleanly: measured over all
 * 34 877 communes, the eight technology columns sum to `nbr_elig_8` in **every
 * single row, with zero exceptions**. That is what this module reports as the
 * headline, because it is the only shape in the register that can be read as a
 * share.
 *
 * Nationally, by best technology: fibre 93,8 %, 4G fixe 4,6 %, cuivre ≥30
 * 0,8 %, coax 0,7 %, satellite 0,1 %.
 *
 * ── Copper is closing, and the register shows it happening ──────────────────
 * `elig_cu` is not a constant: **Ajaccio publishes 0** — every one of its
 * 46 329 premises has already lost its copper pair — while Paris still
 * publishes 1 667 159 of 1 667 292. Nationally copper reaches 51,7 % of
 * premises and falls every quarter. This is a live fact about an address that
 * a static address report cannot carry, and it is worth one line.
 *
 * ── Trap: `1 Gbit/s` can exceed `FTTH`, and it is not an error ──────────────
 * 409 communes publish more gigabit-eligible premises than fibre-eligible
 * ones. Coaxial cable also reaches a gigabit, so the two columns measure
 * different things. Reading `elig_thd1g` as "fibre" would overstate fibre in
 * 409 communes and hide the fact that the medium is cable.
 *
 * ── Trap: the register's own commune names are damaged ──────────────────────
 * 7 496 of 34 877 names carry accents correctly, and some do not: 97701 is
 * published as `Saint-Barthlemy`, with the é simply gone from the bytes. The
 * name on the card comes from the BAN, never from here.
 *
 * ── Trap: three cities are published only at commune level ──────────────────
 * Paris is ONE row of 1 667 292 premises; there are no arrondissements. So a
 * BAN citycode must be folded before it is looked up — `communeCode.js` — and
 * the card must not imply the figure describes the block.
 *
 * Dependency-free and side-effect-free: parsing and projection only. The
 * `/api/arcep-fr` proxy imports it; nothing in the browser bundle does.
