 * on an empty sky, which is the one place the pre-plate bare-text look was
 * already better (field finding, 2026-08-21).
 *
 * So the plate is SCALED here rather than replaced: every theme keeps its own
 * hue and its own relative weight, and the sky case lands at a whisper that is
 * visually the old bare text while still catching a bright cloud. Which case a
 * given label is in comes from `skyBackdropFactor`, blended across a band so
