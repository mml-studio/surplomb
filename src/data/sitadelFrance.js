/**
 * @module sitadelFrance
 *
 * Sitadel — the only forward-looking layer on this globe, drawn on the exact
 * parcels the permits were granted for.
 *
 * `sitadelFeed.js` holds the join and every trap in it. This file is the
 * drawing, and it exists to settle three questions the feed deliberately
 * leaves open: WHERE the layer is allowed to ask, WHAT the two channels claim,
 * and HOW the permits it could not place stay visible without being drawn.
 *
 * ── Against the layer it sits beside ────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `dvf-sales` draws completed transactions: what changed hands, for how much,
 * with a latitude and a longitude already in the file. This draws
 * AUTHORISATIONS — what somebody has been given permission to build and has
 * not necessarily built. DVF looks backwards at price, Sitadel forwards at
 * supply, and on the same parcel the two compose. `bdtopo-buildings` is the
 * stock as surveyed and `urbanisme-gpu` is the rule; a permit is the moment
 * between them.
 *
 * Sitadel publishes NO coordinate — 94 columns on the housing file, 33 on the
 * demolitions, and `geoFields: ["REG","DEP"]` on both. Every position here was
 * computed by joining a cadastral reference to `cadastre-fr`'s own upstream,
 * so every card ends by saying so and by publishing the rate at which that
 * computation succeeded.
 *
 * ── ONE regime, and the arithmetic that forbids a second ────────────────────
 *
 * The four Sitadel files hold 3 020 749 permits over 1.30 GB of CSV, and DiDo
 * answers a filtered, column-projected commune query by SCANNING the whole
 * file: measured 2026-09-02, six sequential queries returned in 3.57–5.01 s
 * whatever their size — Nantes (2 049 rows) took 3.98 s and a single-column
 * probe of the same commune took 3.57 s. A national mesh regime would be
 * 34 945 commune queries at ~4 s, which is 39 hours for one pass. There is no
 * honest maillage, so this layer answers ONE COMMUNE at a time and says which.
 *
 * That also fixes the concurrency, and this is the measurement nobody upstream
 * of this file had: **DiDo refuses a fourth simultaneous request.** Six
 * parallel queries on 2026-09-02 returned three HTTP 200 and three HTTP 429
 * within 145 ms, body `max connections reached: 3` — 26 bytes of plain text,
 * with no `content-type`, no `retry-after` and NO `access-control-allow-origin`,
 * so a browser could not even read the refusal. Three at once are all served.
 * The proxy therefore holds a global semaphore of two and this layer never
 * fetches a second commune while one is in flight.
 *
 * ── The gate: 12 000 m, measured against the communes themselves ────────────
 *
 * At {@link SITADEL_MAX_ALTITUDE_M} a nadir camera at Cesium's default 60°
 * vertical FOV (`VIEW_GATE_DEFAULT_FOV_DEG`) sees 2·h·tan 30° = 13.86 km of
 * ground. The communes this layer answers with are 12.13 km wide (Nantes),
 * 13.29 km (Toulouse) and 17.85 km (Paris) — measured from the outer bounds of
 * their own Etalab cadastre, not estimated. Above that height the answer would
 * be one commune inside a view holding twenty, and the empty ground either side
 * would read as "no permits here" when it means "never asked".
 *
 * There is NO coverage rectangle, deliberately. Sitadel covers the DROM and so
 * does the Etalab cadastre: Saint-Denis de La Réunion (97411) answers with
 * 2 849 permits and a 10 449 654-byte parcel file. A metropolitan box would
 * have refused all of it while claiming national coverage, so the question
 * "is there a French commune under the middle of the screen" is put to
 * `geo.api.gouv.fr`, which is the only service entitled to answer it.
 *
 * ── What the two channels claim ─────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The FILL on a parcel is the lifecycle band of the MOST RECENT authorisation
 * that names it — `ETAT_DAU` read through the three real dates. That is the
 * whole point of the layer: `2` Autorisé is a permit about which nothing
 * further has been reported, `5` Chantier ouvert has a DATE_REELLE_DOC, `6`
 * Travaux achevés has a DATE_REELLE_DAACT, and a permis de démolir is its own
 * band because its own `ETAT_PD` says nothing (1 497 of Nantes' 1 587
 * demolitions and 1 582 of Paris' 1 609 sit at Autorisé). A parcel that
 * carries several permits over thirteen years is coloured by the newest and
 * its card counts the rest; measured on Nantes, 2 747 placed permits sit on
 * 3 032 parcels, so the collision is rare and naming it is cheaper than
 * inventing a rule for it.
 *
 * ── The mark: one badge per permit, and the parcel under it ───────────────
 *
 * Since the approved mock of « Urbanisme » (2026-09-23) a permit is a BADGE —
 * a rounded square in its band colour with a building on it, struck through
 * for a demolition — standing on the anchor of the largest parcel it names,
 * with the parcel washed and outlined in the same colour under it. The badge
 * and its colours are `permitProjects.js`'s, which `ads-fr` draws too: the
 * row's two permit layers now wear ONE palette, and the key prints it once.
 *
 * WHAT IT REPLACED. A dot sized by the square root of the dwellings created,
 * and a 12 m opaque COLUMN per dossier, one metre per dwelling. Both were
 * honest encodings (the column was already the fix for extruding the parcel
 * itself, which had drawn a 45-dwelling permit in Ustaritz as 404 000 m³ of
 * orange), and neither read: a street of columns of four colours is a skyline,
 * not an answer, and the operator asked for the mock's marks. The dwelling
 * count moved to where it is read as a number — the tag the globe keeps over
 * a selected permit (« 40 logements ») and the first line of its card.
 *
 * ONE SIZE FOR EVERY BADGE, scaled down with distance so a commune seen from
 * 10 km is not one blot. A demolition is a badge like the others: the file has
 * 33 columns and none counts a dwelling, and the card says what it removes.
 *
 * A BADGE NEEDS A FLOOR, and a cold floor is not a floor. Billboards draw
 * through depth (`disableDepthTestDistance: Infinity`), so a badge built at
 * the ellipsoid — 44–55 m under metropolitan France — slides across the
 * rooftops with every camera move: measured over Paris on 2026-09-14, all
 * 4 753 dots of the old layer sat at 1.0 m while the drawn mesh read
 * 76.7–96.9 m. `sitadelFloorM` is the floor every mark reads — badge, card,
 * DETECT callout — and `reanchorPoints` re-seats the badges already on screen
 * once their floor lands.
 *
 * ── The period ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The pack is the whole commune since 2013; the row's « Période » (the same
 * three windows as `ads-fr`, whose share-link option this layer mirrors)
 * keeps the permits AUTHORISED inside the window and draws nothing else. The
 * filter runs on the pack in hand: changing the period costs a redraw and no
 * request.
 *
 * ── What changes under the photorealistic stack ─────────────────────────────
 *
 * The parcels stay ground-classified, so on Google 3D they classify as
 * `CESIUM_3D_TILE` and the wash climbs the façades — the drape defect
 * `surfaceFillNotice.js` describes, which is why `getRowControls` declares
 * `surfaceFill` whenever a parcel is washed.
 *
 * The commune OUTLINE is not decoration. It is the scope of the answer, and
 * without it the neighbouring commune reads as "nothing was authorised here"
 * rather than "this was never asked". It is drawn from `geo.api.gouv.fr`'s own
 * `contour`, decimated by `projectGeometry` — Nantes 804 vertices to 269, Paris
 * 532 to 267, Toulouse 1 191 to 398 — which moves the drawn boundary by a mean
 * of 3.6–8.8 m and at worst 183 m (Nantes), 125 m (Paris), 242 m (Toulouse).
 * The row says the outline is simplified. It is never used to decide anything:
 * the commune under the camera is resolved upstream, by the geocoder.
 *
 * ── What is NOT drawn, and where it goes instead ────────────────────────────
 *
 * Measured 2026-09-02 over six communes, both files, against the Etalab
 * cadastre edition 2026-06-01:
 *
 *   Paris      75056   5 204 permits   4 753 placed  91.3%     0 ambiguous
 *   Nantes     44109   3 636           2 747         75.6%     0
 *   Ustaritz   64547     432             238         55.1%     0
 *   Beaupréau  49023     888             484         54.5%   294
 *   Marseille  13055   5 424           1 092         20.1%  4 007
 *   Toulouse   31555   5 687             430          7.6%  5 148
 *   ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *   total             21 271           9 744         45.8%
 *
 * 45.8% is almost exactly the 44.8% DREAL Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes reached on the
 * same data with more time (362 038 permits, 162 171 with a geometry), which is
 * the correct calibration for anyone reading these numbers as a failure.
 *
 * The 11 527 that are not drawn are COUNTED on the row, in `getStats()` and on
 * every card, and they are not in the LEGEND — the panel's swatch IS the datum,
 * and there is no colour for a permit that is nowhere. Nothing is moved to a
 * commune centroid. The three failures are kept apart because a reader can act
 * on the difference: *ambiguous* means the commune publishes section préfixes
 * that Sitadel has no column for and NOTHING will fix it, *missing* means the
 * parcel was divided and renumbered — which is what happens when somebody
 * builds on it — and *noref* means the file is blank.
 *
 * ── The audit agrees with the diagnosis ─────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `SUPERFICIE_TERRAIN` is the plot the applicant declared. It places nothing;
 * it audits. Over the same six communes the share of placed permits whose drawn
 * parcels agree with the declared terrain within a factor of two ranks the
 * communes in the SAME order as the placement rate: Paris 98.4% (4 556/4 630),
 * Nantes 94.2% (2 387/2 533), Beaupréau 86.4%, Ustaritz 84.7%, Marseille 68.6%,
 * Toulouse 51.5% (212/412). An independent measurement agreeing with the join
 * rate is the strongest evidence available that the parcels drawn under the
 * top of that table are the right ones — and the clearest possible warning
 * about the bottom of it. Every card prints its own permit's ratio and the
 * word CONCORDANT or DISCORDANT.
 *
 * ── Two of Sitadel's four files are not read ────────────────────────────────
 *
 * This layer reads the housing register (1 917 260 permits) and the demolitions
 * (202 895) — 2 120 155 of the 3 020 749, or 70.2%. The 792 588 non-residential
 * permits and the 108 006 permis d'aménager are not read, and that is a real
 * hole: Nantes alone has 1 881 non-residential permits and 129 permis
 * d'aménager on top of the 3 636 drawn here, measured through the same URLs.
 * They are omitted because the non-residential file answers a different
 * question — surfaces by destination across seven families, with no dwelling
 * count to size a dot by — and because a third and fourth concurrent DiDo query
 * is exactly the request DiDo answers with 429. The row says two files.
