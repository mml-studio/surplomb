/**
 * Pouls vélo — one typical week of cycling in Lyon and in Paris, and the reason
 * the two cannot be drawn the same way.
 *
 * THE FINDING IS THE LAYER. The Métropole de Lyon publishes the availability of
 * every Vélo'v station continuously since 2023-03-27 — a real archive,
 * filterable per station and per date, the only one of its kind in France.
 * **Paris publishes no equivalent for Vélib' at all.** Verified 2026-09-02:
 * opendata.paris.fr carries two Vélib' datasets and both are real-time only,
 * data.gouv.fr has no availability history, transport.data.gouv.fr's `history`
 * array for the Vélib' dataset is empty, and the community archive everyone
 * cites — `lovasoa/historique-velib-opendata` — was last pushed 2023-04-04 with
 * release assets dated 2021.
 *
 * So the two cities answer through different instruments, and the layer says so
 * on every card rather than quietly averaging them:
 *
 *   · **Lyon measures STOCKS.** How full each dock is, hour by hour. A station
 *     that empties every weekday morning and refills every evening is a
 *     commuter origin; the reverse is a destination. 450 stations.
 *   · **Paris measures FLOWS.** How many cyclists pass each permanent counter,
 *     hour by hour. People going by, not bicycles standing still. 111 counters.
 *
 * ── A HEAT FIELD, AND WHY THE COLUMNS HAD TO GO ─────────────────────────────
 * This layer first shipped as 561 extruded squares: colour for the share, HEIGHT
 * for the absolute quantity. On screen that is a field of floating cubes — one
 * hiding the next, unreadable at nadir where the height channel disappears
 * entirely, and unreadable from far enough away to see a city's shape. A
 * scatter of confetti is not a picture of a city's week.
 *
 * It is drawn as a heat field now: one soft, ground-clamped blob per site,
 * overlapping its neighbours the way a density map does.
 *
 *   · **Colour** is the share of that site's own weekly maximum, on the same
 *     five-band ramp the legend counts — interpolated between the bands, so a
 *     site crossing a threshold swells rather than snaps.
 *   · **Area** is the absolute quantity in that city's own unit — bikes standing
 *     at a Vélo'v dock, cyclists counted in an hour at a Paris counter. Area and
 *     not radius: doubling a radius quadruples the ink, and a reader comparing
 *     two discs reads the ink.
 *
 * Nothing is extruded and nothing floats. What was in the height is now in the
 * spread, and the map reads as one surface instead of 561 objects.
 *
 * ── THE ANIMATION IS EXPLAINED, SLOWER, AND CAN BE STOPPED ──────────────────
 * SEMAINE used to jump a whole hour every 220 ms — 168 discrete states in 37
 * seconds, with no hour on screen, no shape of the week, and no way to stop on
 * one. The clock now runs BETWEEN the hours at 520 ms each (a week in about 87
 * seconds) and every blob eases toward its next value, so the picture swells
 * instead of strobing.
 *
 * The panel under the globe (`veloPulseHud.js`) is the other half of that fix:
 * the hour in words, what the network is doing at it, the whole week as one
 * strip with a cursor — and that strip is a transport the reader can grab.
 *
 * WHAT IS COMPARABLE IS EACH SITE AGAINST ITSELF. The colour ramp is the share
 * of that site's own weekly maximum, so "this is a busy hour here" reads the
 * same in both cities; the AREA keeps each city's own unit, and the card spells
 * it out. The two cities are 390 km apart and never on screen together, so a
 * shared absolute scale would buy nothing and cost the truth.
 *
 * IT IS A TYPICAL WEEK, NOT THE WEEK. Four weeks of June 2026, averaged hour by
 * hour — stated in the pack, on the row, in the panel and on every card, because
 * a typical week in June is not a typical week in January and a reader who does
 * not know which four weeks these are cannot judge them.
