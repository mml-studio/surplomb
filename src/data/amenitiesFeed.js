 *
 * The reading of the two registers behind "où est le plus proche" — INSEE's
 * Base permanente des équipements and the FINESS health-and-social register —
 * and, just as important, the list of things in them this layer REFUSES to
 * draw because another layer already draws them better.
 *
 * `amenitiesMesh.js` holds the middle regime, `amenitiesDepartements.js` the
 * national fold, `amenitiesFrance.js` the rendering. Everything here is pure
 * and runs under `node --test` against real captured rows.
 *
 * ── Why the browser never touches INSEE, and why that is not a size problem ──
 * Measured twice on 2026-09-02 from this machine:
 * `https://www.insee.fr/fr/statistiques/8217525` answers **HTTP 200 with no
 * `Origin` header and HTTP 403 with one** (tested `http://localhost:4173`), on
 * the page, on `BPE25.zip` and on `BPE25.parquet`, for GET and HEAD alike. It
 * also ignores `Range`: `curl -r 0-2000` returns 200, not 206, and starts
 * streaming the whole file. So this is not "too big for a browser", it is
 * unreachable from one — no key, no CORS proxy header, no partial fetch. The
 * fold happens in the dev-server proxy or it does not happen.
 *
 * The size is real too, and it was measured rather than quoted: the archive is
 * **142 884 474 bytes** (51.3 s on this connection), holds exactly one member,
 * and inflates to **1 515 251 530 bytes** of semicolon CSV — **2 921 770 rows ×
 * 95 columns**, 235 distinct TYPEQU codes, 27 SDOM, 7 DOM. INSEE serves it
 * chunked with no `Content-Length`, so a byte-size integrity gate is not
 * available; the zip's own central directory is.
 *
 * ── What is drawn: fourteen families, one register each ─────────────────────
 * The brief's row was *écoles, médecins, pharmacies, supermarchés, piscines,
 * poste, gendarmerie* — seven families, ten BPE codes. On 2026-09-08 the row
 * widened, against a specific target: Cityscan publishes a POI taxonomy of
 * **5 familles × 6 thèmes = 30 types**, and this layer covered four of them.
 * Seven families and fourteen codes were added to cover twenty-one more. The
 * rule that decides every one of them is unchanged and is the reason the
 * education and transport halves of their taxonomy are still refused here:
 * **one register per family, never two** — two registers on one family is how
 * a map ends up with every pharmacy in France drawn twice, forty metres apart.
 *
 * Measured over the live BPE25 archive and the FINESS file on 2026-09-08.
 * "Drawn" is rows that survived the two refusals in Trap 1 and Trap 2; the
 * pack then folds co-located rows of one family into a single dot.
 *
 *   restaurant  BPE A504 — 231 989 rows, 220 480 drawn
 *   boulangerie BPE B207 — 50 122, 47 612 drawn
 *   commerce    BPE B202 + B204 + B205 + B206 — 51 554, 48 335 drawn

 *   courses     BPE B104 + B105 + B201 — 20 802, 20 463 drawn
 *   pharmacie   FINESS categetab 620 — 20 003, NOT BPE D307's 20 334
 *   poste       BPE A206 + A207 + A208 — 16 870, 16 847 drawn
 *   carburant   BPE B316 — 10 497, 10 474 drawn
 *   gendarmerie BPE A104 + A140 — 4 055, 3 963 drawn
 *   piscine     BPE F101 — 3 633, 3 626 drawn
 *   hopital     FINESS categagretab 1101/1102/1106/1110 — 2 585
 *
 * **521 672 drawn, folded to 445 380 dots**, against 126 857 and 95 404 before
 * the widening — 4,1× the rows and 4,7× the dots. The pack on disk goes from
 * 37,8 Mo to **170 Mo**; the national fold from 47 s to 54 s; a cold process
 * reads the pack back in about 1,4 s and answers a viewport in 33 ms. Those
 * four numbers were measured, not estimated, and they are the reason this is
 * one selection rather than an open door: another dense family is another
 * 40 Mo of cache.
 *
 * The single biggest one is worth naming. **A504 alone is 231 989 rows** —
 * more than the seven original families put together — and 34 192 of its drawn
 * rows share a coordinate with another restaurant, which is what a food court
 * and a shopping street look like in this file. It sits at index 0 of
 * `AMENITY_FAMILIES` and is therefore the first family the mesh's per-family
 * budget takes from, and the smallest dot on screen.
 *
 * ── Four Cityscan types this register CANNOT serve ──────────────────────────
 * Checked in `TYPEQU_2025.csv`, not assumed: the 2025 edition publishes 235
 * codes and **none of them is a bar, a café, a débit de boissons, a museum, a
 * tabac or a public garden**. B209 is "commerce de boissons" (8 537 rows), a
 * shop and not a bar; F312 is "exposition et médiation culturelle" (2 145),
 * which is not the museum list. Those four types stay open whatever is added
 * here, and `BPE_ABSENT_TYPES` says so in the payload rather than leaving a
 * reader to conclude there is no café in their street. OpenStreetMap is where
 * they would have to come from.
 *
 * ── What is refused, and the measurement behind each refusal ────────────────
 * 1. **DOM = C, enseignement, 79 743 rows — refused entirely.** `schools-fr`
 *    already draws 68 158 open, geolocated schools from the ministry's own
 *    Annuaire, keyed on the UAI, and `sup-fr` 6 914 higher-education sites.
 *    BPE's C1 + C2 + C3 alone is 48 661 + 7 532 + 5 872 = 62 065 rows over the
 *    same buildings, and it **has no UAI column at all** — this module checked
 *    all 95 delivered names — so a BPE school cannot even be reconciled with
 *    the school already on the globe except by fuzzy address matching. Adding
 *    it would double every school in France from a source whose geocoding is
 *    measurably worse (79.2% `QUALITE_XY = B` over the whole file, against the
 *    ministry's own coordinates). C4–C7, another 17 678 rows, are `sup-fr`'s
 *    subject for the same reason. This covers six of Cityscan's thirty types
 *    and they are served, just not from here.
 * 2. **B326 stations de recharge, 28 819 rows — refused.** `irve-fr` reads the
 *    same fact live from transport.data.gouv.fr, where it is 231 079 charge
 *    points on 39 579 distinct coordinates. Showing 28 819 points frozen at the
 *    2025 vintage beside them is not a second opinion, it is a stale one.
 *    B316 stations-service, next door in the file, ARE drawn: nothing else in
 *    this app knows where the petrol is.
 * 3. **DOM = E, transports, 99 280 rows — refused.** 96 253 of them are
 *    TAXI-VTC operators' registered addresses, which are not equipment a
 *    reader can walk to; the 2 938 gares and 89 aéroports are `transit-fr`'s
 *    and `local-airports`' subject — another six Cityscan types served
 *    elsewhere.
 * 4. **D307 pharmacies, 20 334 rows — refused in favour of FINESS's 20 003.**
 *    The two registers describe the same objects and disagree by 331. FINESS
 *    wins on three measured grounds: `nofinesset` is a stable unique key
 *    (103 032 rows, 103 032 distinct values, zero duplicates), the file is
 *    refreshed monthly against BPE's annual snapshot, and every one of its
 *    102 937 placed rows carries a 2026 `datemaj_geoloc`.
 * 5. **D106 urgences, 695 rows — refused as a duplicate of `hopital`.** Not
 *    asserted: measured. Of the 694 that carry a coordinate, **547 (78.8%) sit
 *    within 200 m of a FINESS hospital-family establishment and 665 (95.8%)
 *    within 1 km, median distance 79 m.** An A&E is a department inside a
 *    hospital, and drawing both puts two dots on one building.
 *
 * Everything else in the file — 113 427 plumbers, 111 080 estate agents,
 * 34 917 mairies — is simply outside the row and is counted, never drawn. The
 * proxy reports the whole 2 921 770 so the card can say what fraction of the
 * register this layer is.
 *
 * ── Trap 1: both registers admit which of their points are invented, and this
 *    module refuses those points rather than drawing them ─────────────────────
 * BPE publishes `QUALITE_GEOLOC`, whose modality **33** INSEE spells out in
 * `BPE25_anonymisee_varmod.csv` as *"Voie inconnue, Position aléatoire dans la
 * commune"*. That is not an imprecise position, it is a drawn one. Over the
 * twenty-two selected BPE codes it is **7 728 rows** — 1 284 over the original
 * ten, and A504 restaurants alone contribute 3 805 — and this module proved
 * the wording literal on the original set: of the 207 communes holding more
 * than one such row (724 rows), only **3** contain any repeated coordinate.
 * The position is re-drawn per row.
 *
 * FINESS does the same thing differently. Its `sourcecoordet` names the
 * geocoder, and **4 646 rows are geocoded against `ADMIN-EXPRESS-2023`** — the
 * IGN commune database — with a score of `.` instead of a number. The
 * partition is exact: geocoder ∈ {BAN 88 737, BDADRESSE 9 535} carries a
 * numeric score, and {ADMIN-EXPRESS-2023 4 646, MAPS 19} carries none. This
 * module proved those are commune centroids: of the 2 619 ADMIN-EXPRESS rows
 * that share a commune with another, **2 612 sit on a byte-identical
 * coordinate**, against 1 608 of 84 561 for the BAN control. Four different
 * establishments in Bourg-en-Bresse all sit at 5.224702, 46.205283.
 *
 * Both are refused: **7 728 BPE rows and 898 FINESS rows** in the drawn
 * families, counted and reported per family, never placed. One register draws
 * a random point in the commune and the other draws the same point for the
 * whole commune; neither is where the thing is.
 *
 * ── Trap 2: a row with no coordinate at all, and where they are ─────────────
 * **12 902 of the 520 612 selected BPE rows publish no LATITUDE** — 170 over
 * the original ten codes, and the widening found far more of them: 7 704
 * restaurants, 2 345 commerces de bouche, 1 565 boulangeries. The dense
 * commercial codes are the worst geocoded in the file, which is a fact about
 * how INSEE builds them and not about where the shops are.
 *
 * **100 of the original 170 were in Mayotte** — every single one of the
 * département's 100 rows in those ten codes, across all five families, with
 * LATITUDE, LONGITUDE, LAMBERT_X and LAMBERT_Y all empty while still declaring
 * `EPSG=4471`. Mayotte has 7 081 BPE rows and 17 communes; this layer draws
 * none of its BPE equipment, and the card says so rather than letting an empty
 * island read as an empty island.
 * FINESS is the counterweight and it is drawn: 189 Mayotte establishments,
 * 28 pharmacies and 7 hospitals among them.
 *
 * ── Trap 3: FINESS coordinates are projected, in five CRS, named inside a
 *    free-text field ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * There is no lat/lon column. `coordxet`/`coordyet` are metres, and the
 * projection is the **fifth comma-separated token of `sourcecoordet`**, e.g.
 * `1,ATLASANTE,96,BAN,EPSG:2154 RGF93 / Lambert-93 (Métropole)`. Measured over
 * all 103 032 rows: every one of the 102 937 non-empty values splits into
 * **exactly five tokens** with the CRS at index 4 — including the two rows
 * reading `4,ATLASANTE,.,MAPS 06-11-2024,WGS84/UTM zone 1S (Wallis-et-Futuna)`,
 * whose token positions are often claimed to shift and do not. So a positional
 * split is correct for 100% of rows and a regex on `EPSG:(\d+)` is not: **18
 * rows carry no `EPSG:` prefix** (16 Saint-Pierre-et-Miquelon, 2
 * Wallis-et-Futuna) and a regex silently drops them.
 *
 * The distribution: EPSG:2154 Lambert-93 100 278 · EPSG:5490 Antilles 1 278 ·
 * EPSG:2975 La Réunion 876 · EPSG:2972 Guyane 298 · EPSG:4471 Mayotte 189 ·
 * WGS84/UTM 21N Saint-Pierre-et-Miquelon 16 · WGS84/UTM 1S Wallis-et-Futuna 2 ·
 * empty 95.
 *
 * **Pushing the 2 659 non-metropolitan rows through the Lambert-93 inverse
 * moves them a median of 6 990 km** — minimum 4 632 km, maximum 21 004 km, the
 * Hôpital de Sia on Wallis landing at 0.88 E / 63.57 N in the Norwegian Sea.
 * The one mercy is that the failure is loud: all 2 659 land OUTSIDE the
 * Lambert-93 area of use, so a sanity gate catches every one. Catching them
 * would still lose 2 659 real establishments. Reading the declared CRS is the
 * only right answer, and it is why this module carries a UTM inverse next to
 * the Lambert-93 one it borrows from `scripts/lib/lambert93.mjs`.
 *
 * ── Trap 4: three vocabularies for one département ──────────────────────────
 * BPE spells the overseas départements `971 972 973 974 976`. FINESS spells the
 * same territories `9A 9B 9C 9D 9F`, plus `9E` Saint-Pierre-et-Miquelon and
 * `9J` Wallis-et-Futuna — measured, not assumed. The bundled IGN outlines use
 * a third set. BPE also spells Corsica `2A`/`2B` where other French registers
 * zero-pad. So nothing here is ever joined on a département code: every point
 * is placed by point-in-polygon in `amenitiesDepartements.js`.
 *
 * ── Trap 5: `_Z` and `_U` are not categories ────────────────────────────────
 * BPE's missing sentinels are the two-character strings `_Z` ("Sans objet") and
 * `_U` ("Indéterminé"), not empty strings — one sampled row carries `_Z` in
 * about forty of its 95 columns, alongside empty strings and literal `"0"`s in
 * the same row. A parser that treats them as values invents a nationwide
 * equipment type called `_Z`. They are read here as "the register does not
 * state this", which is a third thing from "good" and from "bad": **3 626 of
 * the 3 633 bassins de natation carry `QUALITE_XY = _U` and 3 632 carry
 * `QUALITE_GEOLOC = _Z`** — the sports census is not geocoded by the address
 * pipeline at all, so every pool on this map is drawn at a position whose
 * precision INSEE never published.
 *
 * ── Trap 6: the file is a moving target at a stable URL ─────────────────────
 * INSEE: *"Ce fichier d'équipements est actualisé mensuellement pour tenir
 * compte de l'opposition de certains chefs d'entreprise à la diffusion de leurs
 * données à caractère personnel sur sirene.fr."* Row counts and names drift
 * month to month with no version in the path, so `BPE_ROW_FLOOR` below pins
 * what was measured and the proxy warns on drift instead of assuming stability.
 *
 * ── How the edition is discovered ───────────────────────────────────────────
 * Not pinned, and not guessed. `data.gouv.fr` dataset
 * `548acaf2c751df1eac4120e7` is INSEE's own entry (licence `fr-lo`,
 * `frequency: annual`, `last_update` 2026-08-02) and its single resource URL is
 * **the current edition's INSEE landing page** — measured today,
 * `https://www.insee.fr/fr/statistiques/8217537`, titled *"Dénombrement et
 * géolocalisation des équipements en 2025"*. That page lists four sub-pages
 * (8217525, 8217527, 8217532, 8217535) and exactly one of them carries
 * `BPE25.zip`. Three cheap hops, a stable root, and a floor: a discovery that
 * comes back OLDER than `BPE_EDITION_FLOOR` is a malformed answer, not a new
 * fact.
 *
 * Licences. BPE: Licence Ouverte, "Insee, Base permanente des équipements
 * 2025". FINESS: Licence Ouverte 2.0, réexposition data.gouv.fr of the ARS /
 * Agence du Numérique en Santé register, geocoded by ATLASANTE against the BAN.
 * No key, no quota observed.

 * publishes one row per building. BPE has **no per-equipment key at all** —
 * IDEQUIP, IDSOURCE and SOU are documented in `BPE25_dessin_fichier.csv` and
 * are not among the 95 delivered columns, and SIRET is blank on every
 * non-Sirene equipment — so a row is only identifiable by what it is and where
 * it is. And rows pile up: **60 270 médecins généralistes occupy 30 215
 * distinct coordinates**, 12 084 of which hold more than one, up to 146 at a
 * single address in the 14e arrondissement of Paris. Drawing a dot per row
 * would draw one dot and claim it 146 times.
 *
 * So the drawn unit is the position, and the multiplicity moves onto the card,
 * where it is a fact instead of an invisible overdraw: 126 859 rows become
 * **95 406 dots**. Families are never merged into each other — 1 137 positions
 * carry two different families, and a pharmacy inside a supermarket is two
 * things, so those stay as two stacked dots.
 *
 * The surviving precision is the BEST among the merged rows, because the
 * position drawn is one the register did give at that quality; the worst would
 * understate a coordinate that is genuinely a street number.
