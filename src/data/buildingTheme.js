/**
 * The building volumes as a thematic surface — the join, the registry, and the
 * colour of "nobody measured this one".
 *
 * `bdtopoBuildings.js` is the only real 3D geometry in this codebase: 14 000
 * BD TOPO footprints extruded to their surveyed height, batched into a single
 * `Cesium.Primitive` whose per-instance colour can be rewritten at any time
 * (`releaseGeometryInstances: false`). Five layers — DPE, DVF, autorisations
 * d'urbanisme, Sitadel, GPU — currently draw a pin ABOVE the roof they are
 * talking about. This module is the seam that lets them paint the roof instead.
 *
 * It holds no viewer, imports no Cesium and touches no DOM: a theme is data
 * plus three functions, and the join is arithmetic on flat coordinate arrays.
 * That is deliberate — the expensive part (point-in-polygon over a whole
 * viewport) has to be provable in `node --test` without a GPU.
 *
 * ── What it draws, and what it refuses to say ──────────────────────────────
 *
 * • **One theme paints, ever.** Two thematic layers on at once do not blend:
 *   `getActiveBuildingTheme()` returns the lowest `precedence`, ties broken by
 *   registration order, and the loser is not mixed in at half strength. A
 *   volume coloured half by DPE and half by €/m² is a sentence with two verbs.
 *   The winner's `label` travels with the paint so the legend can name it — a
 *   ramp on screen whose owner is not written down is a D1 violation, and with
 *   two candidate owners it is also a lie half the time.
 *
 * • **A building nobody measured must not look measured (A1).** This is the
 *   whole reason the module exists rather than being three lines inside the
 *   BD TOPO layer. When a theme is active, an unjoined volume keeps its usage
 *   hue but is washed to `s × 0.15, l × 0.42` in HSL. Over the six BD TOPO usage
 *   colours and the whole height range the layer draws, that is CIE L* 14.9–33.9
 *   at HSL saturation ≤ 0.113: dark AND grey, both at once.
 *
 *   Measured against the three palettes the first themes will bring — the
 *   official DPE labels, a divergent €/m² ramp, the permit states — the CLOSEST
 *   any class comes to any wash is ΔE76 36.5 (DVF's dark blue `#2166ac` against
 *   a washed tall `Sportif` volume), on a scale where 2.3 is a just-noticeable
 *   difference and 10 is where two colours stop sharing a name. Lightness alone
 *   would not have proved it: that same `#2166ac` is only 8.5 L* above the
 *   brightest wash, and it is the CHROMA that separates them.
 *   `buildingThemeConflicts()` re-runs the check on a theme's own legend at
 *   registration time, so a future theme that ships a dark grey class gets a
 *   console warning instead of quietly colliding with "no data".
 *
 * • **The height channel is re-assigned, and only where it has to be.** Today
 *   a volume's brightness carries its HEIGHT (see `volumeColor`), because 83–87 %
 *   of buildings on a French urban tile share the `Résidentiel`/`Indifférencié`
 *   hue and nothing else separates neighbours. Under a theme the brightness of a
 *   PAINTED volume carries the theme's class instead — one channel, one meaning
 *   (A3) — while UNPAINTED volumes keep the height shading, because they are no
 *   longer in the theme's language at all and the street front still has to be
 *   legible. That is the trade, stated: the theme buys the brightness of the
 *   buildings it can speak about, and pays for it nowhere else.
 *
 * • **Points that land on no building are counted, not swallowed (A5).** Every
 *   join returns `unmatchedPoints` (fell inside the viewport's footprints but in
 *   none of them) and `unplacedPoints` (no finite coordinate at all). A DPE
 *   diagnostic whose address geocoded to the middle of the street is a real
 *   diagnostic that this map does not show, and the layer publishing the theme
 *   is expected to print both numbers.
 *
 * ── The join is by IDENTIFIER first, and by geometry only then ─────────────
 *
 * Until 2026-09-07 the only join here was the geometric one below, and it is a
 * guess: a diagnostic is attached to whichever footprint its BAN geocode
 * happens to land inside. The Référentiel National des Bâtiments ended that for
 * any register that publishes an `id_rnb` — the BD TOPO tiles this layer draws
 * already carry the same key in `identifiants_rnb`, on 95.5 % to 99.2 % of
 * their polygons. A point that names a building is given to that building, full
 * stop; the grid below runs only for the points that name none.
 *
 * Measured over four boxes on 2026-09-07, DPE rows joined to the volumes the
 * layer would draw — Paris 13e 81.8 % → 96.3 %, Lyon 2e 40.4 % → 75.7 %,
 * Marseille 78.8 % → 88.9 %, Ustaritz 14.0 % → 41.5 %. Of the rows both methods
 * place, they disagree on 2, 4, 83 and 4 respectively: buildings that were being
 * painted with a neighbour's letter. `rnbPivot.js` carries the reasoning, the
 * two multiplicities that break a naive index, and the calibration against the
 * RNB's own BD TOPO identifiers.
 *
 * The two are counted apart — `matchedById` and `matchedByPoint` — because they
 * are not the same claim, and A5 is about not letting a guess borrow the
 * authority of a key. `idOffScreen` is the third number: a point whose
 * identifier names no drawn footprint, which is then offered to the grid like
 * any other point rather than being dropped as "matched elsewhere".
 *
 * ── The geometric join, and why it is indexed ──────────────────────────────
 *
 * A viewport at `BDTOPO_MAX_BOX_DEG` (0.08° ≈ 9 km) holds up to the 14 000-volume
 * cap; a DPE or DVF payload over the same box is a few hundred points. The naive
 * nested loop is O(buildings × points) polygon tests — at 3 000 footprints × 200
 * points that is 600 000 ray casts over ~10-vertex rings, measured on this
 * machine at 35–176 ms depending on how warm the JIT is, i.e. two to ten dropped
 * frames every time a theme refreshes its points. At the cap, 14 000 × 2 000, the
 * same loop takes 3.0–16.7 s and there is no version of that which ships.
 *
 * Instead the footprints go into a uniform lon/lat grid sized `span / √n`: 30 m
 * cells for a dense payload, 75 m at the cap, against footprints 15–30 m wide, so
 * a footprint lands in one or two cells and the fullest bucket measured over
 * 14 000 synthetic buildings held 4. A point then tests only its own bucket.
 * Measured, best of nine runs, index build included:
 *
 *     3 000 × 200      2.2 ms  and    200 polygon tests   (naive:  34.9 ms / 600 000)
 *     14 000 × 2 000   8.7 ms  and  2 000 polygon tests   (naive: 2 967 ms / 28 M)
 *
 * The test file re-measures the polygon-test count — the one figure that is not
 * machine-dependent — and fails if it drifts back towards the product of the two
 * populations.
 *
 * Two rules the grid does not decide, and that the tests pin down:
 *
 * • **A point in two footprints goes to the SMALLER one.** BD TOPO polygons do
 *   not overlap in theory; in practice an annexe drawn inside a courtyard, and a
 *   building cut across two tiles and drawn twice, both produce genuine double
 *   hits. The smaller footprint is the more specific claim, and the rule is
 *   deterministic (ties broken by id) so the same point never migrates between
 *   two volumes because the tile order changed.
 *
 * • **The edge belongs to one side only.** The crossing test is half-open in
 *   latitude, which makes the west and south edges part of the polygon and the
 *   east and north edges not. Two buildings sharing a party wall therefore never
 *   both claim a diagnostic that geocoded exactly onto it.
 *
 * Holes are subtracted: a point inside a courtyard ring is outside the building.
 * The BD TOPO layer keeps interior rings precisely because dropping them welds
 * a street front into one block, and a join that ignored them would hand the
 * courtyard's own point to the building around it.
 *
 * ── What it does NOT do ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Aggregation is not decided here. One building = several DPE diagnostics and
 * several sales is the NORMAL case, not the edge case, and "worst grade of the
 * block" and "median €/m² of the block" are different questions with different
 * right answers. The theme brings its own `reduce(points)`; this module only
 * guarantees it is called once per building with every point that landed on it,
 * in the order the caller supplied them.
