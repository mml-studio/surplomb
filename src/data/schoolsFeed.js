/**
 * @module schoolsFeed
 *
 * The seam between the Annuaire de l'éducation's records and what the browser
 * is served for one viewport.
 *
 * Lives here rather than inside `vite.config.js` for the same reason
 * `irveFeed.js` does: the register is assembled from every académie's own
 * référentiel, and the fields disagree with themselves in ways only a test
 * against a real captured payload keeps honest. The dev-server proxy imports
 * `projectSchoolSites`; nothing in the browser bundle does.
 *
 * ── What the dataset IS ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * `fr-en-annuaire-education` — the MENJ's own **Annuaire de l'éducation**,
 * published on data.education.gouv.fr under **Licence Ouverte 2.0**, rebuilt
 * daily (`modified` observed moving to 2026-09-01 during this work). One row
 * per UAI — the *unité administrative immatriculée*, the State's identifier
 * for an establishment. Measured 2026-09-01: **68 939 rows**, of which
 * **68 557** are `etat = OUVERT` and **68 158** are both open and carry a
 * coordinate.
 *
 * ── What it is NOT ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * It is not a roll. Nothing in these 68 939 rows says how many pupils are in a
 * school — that lives in four separate per-level datasets, joined here on the
 * UAI (see `SCHOOLS_ROLL_DATASETS`). So a site with no roll is drawn at the
 * base size and says "effectif non publié", never zero: an establishment
 * missing from the roll files is not an empty school.
 *
 * ── Trap 1: a UAI is not a building ─────────────────────────────────────────
 * The register's unit is administrative, and several UAIs routinely share one
 * physical site. Measured against the rentrée-2025 roll files: of the 5 235
 * open teaching establishments with no roll, **2 212 are SECTIONS** — 1 462
 * `SECTION ENSEIGNT GEN. ET PROF. ADAPTE` (SEGPA) and 750 `SECTION D
 * ENSEIGNEMENT PROFESSIONNEL` (SEP) — sub-UAIs whose pupils are already
 * counted inside the collège or lycée they sit in, at the same coordinate.
 *
 * They are kept and drawn, because they are real establishments with real
 * addresses and the register is what this layer draws. But `motherUai` travels
 * with every site that has one, so a reader who sees two dots at one address
 * can see why, and so a future roll-up can fold them without re-deriving it.
 *
 * ── Trap 2: the coordinate has a published quality, and it is not uniform ───
 * `precision_localisation` is the register's own account of how well it
 * geocoded each row, and it is worth surfacing rather than flattening.
 * Measured over the full file: 50 874 at `Numéro de rue`, 10 139 at `Rue`,
 * 3 600 `PLAQUE_ADRESSE`, **2 159 at `Ville` — the commune centroid, not the
 * school** — plus a long tail of 18 further spellings from the académies'
 * various pipelines (`Parfaite`, `BATIMENT`, `CENTRE_PARCELLE`, `MANUEL`,
 * `NE SAIT PAS`…). They are folded onto a four-step ladder here, and a site
 * geocoded only to its commune says so on its card.
 *
 * ── Trap 3: 399 open establishments have no coordinate at all ───────────────
 * Measured: `position IS NULL` on 399 rows, every one of them `OUVERT`. They
 * are dropped at the query, not placed at their commune's centroid — an
 * invented coordinate is indistinguishable from a real one once it is a dot,
 * and the layer would be silently claiming to know where 399 schools are.
 * The count is carried to the client so the shortfall is stated, not hidden.
 *
 * ── Trap 4: the booleans are 1 / 0 / null, and null is not false ────────────
 * `restauration`, `hebergement`, `ulis`, `segpa` and the section flags publish
 * `1`, `0` and `null`, where null means "not declared" rather than "no". A
 * plain coercion turns every undeclared school into one with no canteen. They
 * are read to `true` / `false` / `null` and the card omits what was never
 * declared instead of denying it.
 *
 * ── Trap 5: `type_etablissement` conflates and mis-sorts ────────────────────
 * The field has 8 values and one of them, `Ecole` (48 727), covers both
 * maternelle (12 264 by `libelle_nature`) and élémentaire (36 188). Splitting
 * the colour ladder there was rejected: a school can be BOTH — the annuaire's
 * own `ecole_maternelle` and `ecole_elementaire` flags are independently set,
 * and a primaire has both — so a maternelle/élémentaire colour would have to
 * invent a rule for the most common case. The ladder is therefore by SCHOOL
 * LEVEL, five bands, and the maternelle/élémentaire detail rides on the card
 * where it can be stated without being forced into one colour.
 *
 * The other conflation is at the far end: `Service Administratif` (1 960
 * rectorats and DSDEN), `Information et orientation` (424 CIO) and `Autre`
 * (372) are in the register but are not schools. They are kept — the layer
 * draws the register, and dropping 2 756 rows would be a silent editorial
 * decision — and given their own band so the legend names them instead of
 * letting them pass as schools.
 *
 * ── Trap 6: the second attribute join, and it covers two thirds ────────────
 * The roll is not the only thing the register does not hold. The DEPP's
 * *indice de position sociale* is published in four further files, keyed on
 * the same UAI, and it is joined here the same way — see `ipsFeed.js`, which
 * holds the four datasets, their four DIFFERENT newest rentrées, and the
 * reasons an IPS is not a number you may default.
 *
 * The two joins fail differently and the site says which. A missing roll is
 * one file not covering one establishment. A missing IPS is **62 857 drawn
 * schools that could carry one against 40 529 with a published index
 * (64.5%)** — a third of the map, and a third that must read as "not
 * published" and never as average. `site.ips` therefore has three shapes and
 * they are not interchangeable: absent (this kind of establishment has no IPS
 * at all — a rectorat, a CIO), `null` (the index was consulted and has no row)
 * and a record (which may itself say the DEPP withheld the value).
 *
 * Dependency-free and side-effect-free (no Cesium, no DOM) so it runs
 * identically in the browser, in the Vite dev-server proxy, and under
 * `node --test`.
