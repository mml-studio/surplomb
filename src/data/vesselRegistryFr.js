 * @module vesselRegistryFr
 * @description The MMSI → ship-type join that fills what AIS declares empty,
 * and the rule that decides when the register is allowed to speak.
 *
 * ── THE BUCKET THIS CLOSES ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `aisStaticRegistry.js` solved half of "Type non déclaré": the half where the
 * server had simply not heard the identity message yet, and threw away what it
 * had learned at every restart. Measured on the live feed on 2026-09-10 over
 * 5 749 contacts in the Channel / North Sea box, that half is 543 contacts —
 * 9.4 %. Uptime fixes it.
 *
 * The other half does not fix itself. 1 934 contacts (33.6 %) broadcast ship
 * type **0, "not available"**: the transponder is speaking, the field was never
 * configured, and it will say 0 for as long as the boat floats. Listening
 * longer buys nothing. 100 % of them publish a NAME, 0.8 % publish an IMO
 * number, and the 40 % that publish a hull are 7 to 25 m long — they are
 * pleasure craft and small workboats whose owners never filled the field in.
 *
 * So the type has to come from somewhere that is not the transponder, keyed on
 * the one identifier the transponder does publish: the MMSI.
 *
 * ── THE SOURCE, AND WHY IT IS THE ONLY ONE ──────────────────────────────────
 *
 * ANFR, « Données radiomaritimes » — the French maritime radio licence
 * register. 133 506 MMSIs carrying a category, Licence Ouverte v2.0, free,
 * republished monthly. Measured against the live feed the same day: **93.1 %
 * of French-flagged undeclared contacts are found**, filling 618 of 2 477
 * (24.9 % of the bucket).
 *
 * There is no second one. The undeclared bucket is 26.7 % French, 23.4 %
 * British, 11.5 % Dutch, 9.8 % Belgian, 5.7 % German — and both of the next
 * two registers are dead ends, checked on 2026-09-10: the MCA's UK MMSI
 * register is listed on data.gov.uk but is not downloadable (it carries owner
 * addresses), and the Dutch "Maritieme roepletters" is under a closed licence
 * AND carries no type field at all. France is the join that exists.
 *
 * ── WHY FOUR CATEGORIES AND NOT ELEVEN ──────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The ANFR field is a RADIO LICENCE category, not a ship type. Cross-checked
 * over the 431 contacts where the transponder AND the register both declared
 * something:
 *
 *   PLAISANCE 100 % · H.S.C. 100 % · PASSAGERS 97 % · PÊCHE 95 %   → trusted
 *   CHARGE 9 % · FLUVIAL 0 % · N.U.C. 0 % · SPÉCIAL 0 % · AUTRE 0 % → refused
 *
 * `CHARGE` is "commercial, not passengers": it calls tugs (AIS 52), dredgers
 * (33) and pilot boats (50) cargo ships. `FLUVIAL` is "river licence" and
 * describes no ship at all. Keeping them would have repainted 242 correctly
 * typed vessels with a wrong family — a worse answer than the slate.
 *
 * Restricted to the four, the join fills 508 contacts at ~98 % accuracy.
 *
 * ── THE RULE ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The register NEVER outranks the transponder. It is consulted only where the
 * ship declared nothing — empty, or the protocol's own "not available" 0 — and
 * a later real declaration takes the type straight back. What the hull says
 * about itself wins, always; the register only speaks into a silence.
 *
 * Everything here is pure — no fs, no fetch, no clock. `vite.config.js` owns
 * the file read, `scripts/build-anfr-vessel-types.mjs` owns the extraction.

 * the same token means a joined vessel travels through the hue table, the
 * legend and the card by the same path as a declared one, with no branch that
 * could let the two drift apart.
 *
 * The categories NOT here are refused on measured evidence; see the module
