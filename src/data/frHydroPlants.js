/**
 * Centrales hydro — every hydro plant in France's national register, not just
 * the big ones, plus the 592 stations OpenStreetMap maps elsewhere.
 *
 * This layer exists because of a hole a user found by looking for one place.
 * There are nine hydroelectric plants in the commune of Laruns, in the
 * Pyrénées-Atlantiques — Miégebat, Le Hourat, Pont-de-Camps, Artouste, Bious,
 * Geteu, Fabrèges, Espalungue, Artouste-Lac — 223,9 MW between them, and NONE
 * of them appeared anywhere on this globe. Not a bug: the *Centrales EDF* layer
 * draws EDF SA's own fleet and those nine are SHEM's, and the *Groupes de prod*
 * layer has a 100 MW floor because that is RTE's publication floor, and every
 * plant at Laruns is below it. Two correct layers, and a whole valley of
 * generating capacity between them.
 *
 * Measured against ODRÉ's national register: France has **2 757 hydro
 * installations for 26,04 GW**, and the two existing layers between them could
 * draw 56 of them. This layer draws the rest.
 *
 * ── What is drawn, and what a marker means ──────────────────────────────────
 *
 * There are exactly TWO kinds of marker here, and the difference between them
 * is the difference between a known position and an unknown one:
 *
 * **A filled disc is a plant, where it is.** Area proportional to installed
 * power, coloured by the register's own technology vocabulary. **589 of the 998
 * positions are a building footprint surveyed by IGN** — the data the Plan IGN
 * is drawn from, median span 32 m, with IGN's own planimetric accuracy printed
 * on the card. The rest come from EDF's published point, an OpenStreetMap
 * object this build could prove is that plant, or the RTE yard whose published
 * code the register names. The card says which, and says which OBJECT.
 *
 * **A hollow ring is a COMMUNE, not a plant.** It stands for every plant in
 * that commune no source places, and it is drawn at the commune centre because
 * that is the only thing the register publishes about them. It says how many
 * and how much, never where.
 *
 * The ring exists because the alternative was worse in two ways at once.
 * Measured across the 998 plants this build does place: **the commune centre
 * sits a median 2,5 km from the actual powerhouse, and p90 7,5 km.** In an
 * Alpine or Pyrenean valley that is routinely the wrong side of a ridge, on a
 * different river. And 1 744 plants share 1 147 communes, so drawing them
 * individually would stack up to a dozen markers on one pixel, each of them
 * asserting a position none of them has.
 *
 * ── Honesty rules this layer is built around ────────────────────────────────
 *
 * • **Half of this register has no name, and the card says so instead of
 *   inventing one.** 1 359 of the drawn installations publish `Confidentiel`
 *   where a name belongs — small private plants whose operator is a person.
 *   They are NOT dropped and they are NOT labelled "Confidentiel": the card
 *   leads with what the register does publish about them, which is nearly
 *   everything else. Commune, installed power, technology, commissioning date,
 *   connection voltage, source substation, grid operator, EIC code — and the
 *   energy actually injected over the last twelve months, on 90 % of them.
 *   An anonymous plant is a full card missing one line.
 *
 * • **Installed power is not output, except in the one line where it is.**
 *   Every disc is sized by NAMEPLATE. The card's `energyKwh` line is the only
 *   measurement in the layer, and it is a trailing twelve-month total, not a
 *   live reading — the *Groupes de prod* layer owns live output, and it cannot
 *   see any of these plants.
 *
 * • **26,04 GW is the register's figure, not this layer's placement claim.**
 *   `getStats()` reports installed, placed and clustered capacity separately,
 *   because "France has 26 GW of hydro" and "this globe shows you where 24,3 GW
 *   of it is" are different sentences.

 * • **Four rows are filed under the wrong commune, and the card shows both
 *   claims.** The register puts the 30 MW Lac d'Oô — Luchon, Haute-Garonne — in
 *   Guyane, Luz in Martinique, Motz in Guadeloupe and Pont-du-Loup at La
 *   Réunion. Each is caught by its own `postesource`, whose OpenStreetMap
 *   `ref:FR:RTE` sits thousands of kilometres from the commune named. The plant
 *   is drawn at its substation and the card prints the register's claim beside
 *   the contradiction, rather than quietly correcting the publisher.
 *
 * • **26 hydro plants are published as photovoltaic and the layer refuses to
 *   colour them.** 25 in Corsica — Rizzanese, Castirla, Tolla, Calacuccia — are
 *   the island's real hydro fleet carrying `technologie = Photovoltaïque` in
 *   ODRÉ's own file. They keep their disc and their published string on the
 *   card, and count as technology-unpublished in the legend. See trap 4 in
 *   `frHydroFeed.js`.
 *
 * • **This layer overlaps the other two, and nothing is de-duplicated.** The 56
 *   plants above 100 MW are in all three registers. Drawing them once here is
 *   correct — this is the national register — and a reader who turns on
 *   *Centrales EDF* too will see EDF's own coordinate for the same station,
 *   sometimes a few hundred metres away. Quietly dropping one publisher's
 *   figure would hide that they disagree.
 *
 * The register is a shipped file — `local_data/fr_hydro_plants/plants.json`,
 * rebuilt with `npm run hydro:registry` — because the register publishes no
 * coordinates at all, and every position here is a join of four sources done at
 * authoring time so it is auditable in the diff. See that script's header.
