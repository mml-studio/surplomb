/**
 * Build `src/data/local_data/fr_hydro_plants/plants.json` — every hydro
 * installation in France's national register, and the best position anyone
 * publishes for each.
 *
 * WHY THIS SCRIPT EXISTS: **the register has no coordinates, and half of it has
 * no names.** ODRÉ's *Registre national des installations de production et de
 * stockage d'électricité* is the only nationwide list of French hydro — 2 757
 * installations, 26,04 GW — and for each one it publishes a commune INSEE code
 * and nothing spatial. 1 359 of the rows publish `Confidentiel` where a name
 * should be. So both the position and the identity have to be joined in from
 * elsewhere, at authoring time, and committed so every row is auditable in the
 * diff instead of derived live from three services that each drift.
 *
 * This is the same problem `build-rte-units-registry.mjs` solves for the ≥ 100
 * MW fleet, one order of magnitude down and much harder: that script places 108
 * stations that mostly have a published EDF coordinate, this one faces 2 757
 * plants of which EDF publishes 51.
 *
 *   1. **ODRÉ — Registre national** (Licence Ouverte 2.0). The spine: EIC code,
 *      installed power, technology, commune, connection voltage and substation,
 *      regime, commissioning date, grid operator, and the rolling twelve-month
 *      energy actually injected. Coordinates: none.
 *
 *   2. **EDF Open Data** (Licence Ouverte 2.0), `centrales-de-production-
 *      hydraulique-de-edf-sa`. 51 plants, with the operator's own coordinate for
 *      its own station. Beware: **`coordonnees_x_wgs` is the LATITUDE** — read
 *      the usual way, Grand-Maison lands off Somalia. Guarded below.
 *
 *   3. **OpenStreetMap** (ODbL 1.0), via Overpass: `power=plant` +
 *      `plant:source=hydro`. 1 947 elements over the France box, of which the
 *      join uses whatever it can prove. Keep the contributor attribution when
 *      redistributing the file this writes.
 *
 *   4. **geo.api.gouv.fr** (Licence Ouverte), commune centres — used to BOUND
 *      the search for a candidate, and as the anchor for the plants no source
 *      places. See the placement rule.
 *
 * ── The placement rule ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 *   `edf-published`  the operator's own point for a station it names. Nothing
 *                    is inferred about which object the plant is.
 *   `osm-plant`      a volunteer-mapped `power=plant` inside the commune's
 *                    12 km ring, claimed by name, then by megawatts, then by
 *                    being the only candidate for the only row. Every plant
 *                    records WHICH of the three under `matchedBy`.
 *   (none)           everything else. These are NOT drawn at their commune
 *                    centre as plants — they are rolled up into one marker per
 *                    commune. See `clusterUnplaced` in `frHydroFeed.js` for the
 *                    measurement that forced that choice: the commune centre
 *                    sits a median 3,4 km from the powerhouse, and beyond 3 km
 *                    for half of them, which in a Pyrenean valley is a
 *                    different river.
 *
 * Rows are placed LARGEST FIRST and each OSM element can be claimed once, so a
 * 74 MW plant takes the outline a 0,4 MW plant might otherwise have matched on
 * a shared token. Nothing is ever averaged between two anchors — an average of
 * two published positions is a third, unpublished one.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   npm run hydro:registry
 *   npm run hydro:registry -- --report        # full placement + coverage audit
 *   npm run hydro:registry -- --floor-kw=1000 # only plants ≥ 1 MW
 *   npm run hydro:registry -- --refresh-osm   # re-query Overpass, ignore cache
 *   npm run hydro:registry -- --allow-partial # accept a run with OSM down
