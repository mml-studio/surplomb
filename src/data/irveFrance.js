/**
 * @module irveFrance
 *
 * France's public EV charging register — the *fichier consolidé des bornes de
 * recharge pour véhicules électriques*, assembled daily by
 * transport.data.gouv.fr from the operators' own IRVE filings and republished
 * on ODRÉ under Licence Ouverte 2.0. Keyless. 231 079 points de charge,
 * measured 2026-08-27.
 *
 * WHAT THIS IS, AND WHAT IT IS NOT. This is INSTALLED CAPACITY, not
 * availability. Nothing in the file says whether a charge point is free right
 * now, working, or occupied — that lives in each operator's own OCPI endpoint,
 * behind a contract. So this layer never draws an availability colour and
 * never prints a "libre" count, which is the single easiest way to make an EV
 * map lie. It draws what is installed, and the card says when the operator
 * last said so.
 *
 * ── Three regimes, because 40 000 sites is not a national picture ───────────
 * 231 079 charge points sit on 39 579 distinct coordinates. Drawn as dots at
 * national altitude that is a solid smear over France that says nothing; drawn
 * only when you are over a city, the country-scale question cannot be asked at
 * all. So the layer answers at the scale you are looking at:
 *
 *   whole country in view — **96 PRISMS**: each département polygon extruded
 *       (span ≥ 9.5°)       to the number of charge points it holds and
 *                           coloured by its density, with the leaders
 *                           labelled. 18 KB, no clutter.
 *   part of the country   — **the maillage**: a CARROYAGE locked to the
 *       (9° … 0.35°)        graticule, one mark per occupied cell, standing on
 *                           a real site inside it and carrying the cell's
 *                           complete charge-point total. 0.25° … 1/64°.
 *   one city              — **every site**, with its operators, connectors,
 *       (below ~45 km)      access conditions and freshness.
 *
 * The three never draw at once and each has its own legend, so a colour can
 * never be read against the wrong scale.
 *
 * ── ONE GRAMMAR ACROSS THE THREE, SINCE 2026-09-10 ─────────────────────────
 *
 * HEIGHT IS THE COUNT. COLOUR IS THE KIND OR THE RATE. The national prism said
 * that already; the other two said something else entirely — the beam's length
 * was the number of markers on screen (960 of them, all 55.8 px, all saying
 * nothing) and the count was on a disc diameter worth 0.44 px between a 2-plug
 * car park and a 6-plug one. The count now stands up: a site's beam is its
 * charge points on a frozen square-root domain, and the maillage beam is
 * uniform BECAUSE a maillage mark stands for a cell rather than for itself.
 *
 * AND THE MARK CARRIES ITS OWN LEGIBILITY, which the first attempt at this got
 * wrong: it pinned the disc at 7 px on the reasoning that the beam was now
 * doing the seeing, and over Bordeaux at 12 653 m that drew **318 marks nobody
 * could find**. A beam is a WORLD vertical, so it dies exactly where a reader
 * looks — the shortest one on screen in that view was 1.1 px. The mark is a
 * PLATE with a bolt punched out of it now, sized against an ink budget rather
 * than pinned, and `irveMarkIcons.js` carries that argument. Every measurement
 * and every clamp is beside the code — {@link irveBeamPdcPx},
 * {@link IRVE_MARK_SPARSE_PX}, `BEAM_MAX_M`.
 *
 * AND THERE IS A FILTER. Four rungs of the band ladder — TOUT, > 22, > 50,
 * > 150 kW — because 960 marks that all mean "charging exists here" do not
 * answer the question a driver has (G1). The exact regime flips a
 * `filteredOut` flag and never rebuilds its collection (G2); the maillage
 * re-picks, because the floor changes which site represents a cell and what
 * the cell totals. {@link IRVE_POWER_FLOORS} carries the shares.
 *
 * The national regime draws the bundled IGN département polygons that
 * `meteoFranceVigilance.js` and `franceEnergy.js` also paint — but EXTRUDED
 * rather than clamped, which is a different Cesium object with different rules,
 * and the section below is that argument. The maillage's cell rule is
 * `cctvLod.js`'s ambient-ring distribution transposed from screen space to
 * geographic space, over a lattice that is now world-locked (see `irveMesh.js`).
 *
 * ── The national regime is a prism, and each channel says one thing ─────────
 *
 * HEIGHT is the number of charge points. COLOUR is the density per 1 000 km².
 * The shared grammar, its calibration and the arbitrations that produced it
 * live once in `choroplethPrism.js`; what follows is what is specific to this
 * layer, measured on this layer's own data.
 *
 * WHAT THIS REPLACES, AND WHY THE OLD ARGUMENT WAS WRONG. Until now the fill
 * was the ABSOLUTE COUNT in six quantile bins, and `irveDepartements.js`
 * argued for it at length: the density spans a factor of 2 254 (43.7 charge
 * points per 1 000 km² in Lozère against 98 509.6 in Paris, re-measured
 * 2026-09-03), so painting it "leaves 95 départements indistinguishable". The
 * measurement is right, the inference is not, twice over.
 *
 *   · Ninety-five-indistinguishable is a property of an EQUAL-INTERVAL ramp.
 *     Six equal steps of 16 411 over that range give an occupancy of
 *     94 · 1 · 0 · 0 · 0 · 1. The GEOMETRIC ladder below, over the same
 *     numbers, gives 11 · 27 · 28 · 19 · 7 · 4 — every class inhabited, and
 *     the top one holding exactly the four inner-Paris départements.
 *   · An absolute count was never allowed on a fill at all (CARTOGRAPHY B1).
 *     The alternative the old header weighed — count fill against rate fill —
 *     had one channel and two candidates. A globe has two channels.
 *
 * THE HEIGHT DOMAIN IS FROZEN AT 12 000 CHARGE POINTS, and it is a literal,
 * never a maximum recomputed from the payload (C1). Measured highs: 10 539
 * (Paris, 2026-08-27) and 10 245 (Paris, 2026-09-03) — the register moves in
 * both directions, since the national total fell from 231 079 to 227 007 over
 * the same week. 12 000 leaves ~15 % of headroom above the highest figure ever
 * measured, so the top of the scale is not permanently clipped by the ordinary
 * growth of the network, and it puts the 10 000 legend tick at 100 km, which
 * is a ruler mark a reader can hold Paris against. A département above 12 000
 * would be drawn at the top and DECLARED as clipped by the legend (A5).
 *
 * THE HEIGHT SCALE IS LINEAR, and that is a decision against the one hint
 * `choroplethPrism.js` gives this layer: it names `irve-fr` as a `'sqrt'`
 * candidate because the domain runs 1 : 45 and the 4 km floor eats everything
 * under 3.3 % of the domain. Measured rather than assumed, the floor bites at
 * 400 charge points, and THREE départements of 96 are under it — Cantal (373),
 * Creuse (347), Lozère (226). Three floored units is not "the floor doing all
 * the work"; it is the A1 floor doing its job on the three smallest networks
 * in France. Against that, `'sqrt'` would draw Paris as 2.4× the median when
 * it is 5.5×, on the one channel the eye reads best. Linear stands, and the
 * cost is written into the legend rather than hidden.
 *
 * At national altitude (~1 500 km, the camera distance at which the 9.5° entry
 * span is reached) the scale reads: Paris 102.5 km = 98.6 px, Nord 78.0 km =
 * 75.1 px, the median département 18.5 km = 17.8 px, Lozère on the floor at
 * 4 km = 3.9 px. Median-to-top spread is 80.8 px, twice the 40 px under which
 * `choroplethPrism.js` says the map has become a flat fill again.
 *
 * THE COLOUR LADDER IS GEOMETRIC AND FROZEN: 100 / 250 / 500 / 1 000 / 2 500
 * charge points per 1 000 km², i.e. steps of ×2.5, ×2, ×2, ×2.5, which is what
 * a 2 254 : 1 range needs. Six classes, because CARTOGRAPHY B3 puts the
 * perceptible ceiling at six to seven AFTER compositing, and the geometric
 * ladder is preferred to quantiles for the C1 reason: quantiles are a property
 * of the sample and would have to be recomputed — the same département would
 * change class because a sweep lost a stripe, with no change in the world.
 *
 * WHAT THE PRISM REMOVES FOR FREE. An extruded polygon is not a
 * `GroundPrimitive`, so two defects this repo has already paid for stop
 * applying: the batched ground fill that colours each instance by its bounding
 * RECTANGLE instead of its polygon, and the F4 drape that
 * `surfaceFillNotice.js` exists to declare — a thematic tint climbing the
 * façades of the photorealistic mesh, where the tileset's own shading changes
 * the colour a reader decodes. This layer therefore does NOT raise
 * `surfaceFill` in its row controls: every département that carries a count is
 * a prism, and in the register as measured on 2026-09-03 that is all 96 of
 * them. The exception is the flat footprints below, which stay clamped
 * precisely so that they still land on whatever surface is up.
 *
 * WHAT THE PAIRING BUYS, in this layer's own terms. The prism keeps the areal
 * bias every choropleth has — a big rural département makes a big volume at
 * equal count — but the colour is the audit of the height: Gironde reads TALL
 * (7 455 points, 74.6 km) and PALE (739.8 per 1 000 km², class 4 of 6), Paris
 * reads TALL (10 245, 102.5 km) and SATURATED (98 509.6, top class), and the
 * difference between "a lot, spread thin" and "a lot, packed" is finally on
 * the map instead of only on the card.
 *
 * FOUR STATES, FOUR MARKS, because the two measurements are refused
 * independently and A1 forbids one sign for two facts (see
 * `repaintDepartements` for the code and `prismRow` for the contract):
 *
 *   count ✓ density ✓ → a prism at its height, body in its density colour
 *   count ✓ density ✗ → a prism at its height, body STRIPED — the height is
 *                       measured, the colour is refused, and the two absences
 *                       do not contaminate each other
 *   count = 0         → a FLAT footprint, filled: "the register lists nothing
 *                       here" is a measurement, and it is drawn, not hidden
 *   count ✗           → a flat footprint in a GRID, because D3 wants a motif
 *                       and not a tint where there is no neutral colour
 *
 * The last two are the only shapes still clamped to the ground, which is why
 * `classificationType` still matters for them and is re-armed on every repaint
 * — and why they cannot be outlined, since Cesium refuses an outline on
 * terrain. They are told apart by their material instead. The legend counts
 * each of them separately.
 *
 * A thinned map that does not say it is thinned is a map claiming France has
 * 1 100 charge points, so the middle regime always prints how many marks it
 * drew against how many sites are in view — AND the criterion, which used to
 * be missing: « sampled maillage » said how many were dropped and never which
 * ones. It also called lattice cells "sites", which is the same word for two
 * different units. Both are fixed in {@link buildIrveLoadingLabel}.
 *
 * WHERE THIS LAYER'S CLOCK IS. `fetchedAt` is when the proxy swept — a fact
 * about this server, never printed as the data's own date (E4). The date that
 * IS printed is `date_maj`, the operator's own filing, because a tenth of this
 * file has not been touched since 2023 and E1 is P0 — and since 2026-09-14 it
 * is printed on the CARD, per site, rather than in the key as the newest
 * filing in view. Per site it is also a stronger statement: the view-wide
 * maximum said nothing about the station the reader had clicked, and it needed
 * a guard against the 56 rows of 227 007 stamped 2026-12-30 to mean anything
 * at all. The proxy keeps its own guard in `fetchIrveLastFiling`.
 *
 * WHAT IS DRAWN PER DOT. One dot per SITE — per coordinate, not per station.
 * That is forced by the data rather than chosen: Q-Park's Grande Arche car
 * park publishes 127 distinct `id_station_itinerance` values at one point, one
 * per charge point, and 1 192 rows nationally publish the literal string
 * `"Non concerné"` as their station id.
 *
 * WHAT IS NOT DOUBLE-COUNTED. Measured over Île-de-France, 442 of 3 812 sites
 * carry two "operators" publishing an identical power profile at the same
 * point — TotalEnergies Charging Services beside TotalEnergies Marketing
 * France, ENGIE Vianeo beside its Greenflux back end — worth 7.5% of the
 * area's charge points. Those collapse to one, in `irveFeed.js`, and the card
 * names what was collapsed. Merely overlapping publications never collapse.
 *
 * Every other trap this dataset carries — coordinates labelled backwards,
 * watts in a kilowatt column, eight spellings of a boolean, mojibake, and a
 * verification flag that is False for two quite different reasons — is
 * absorbed server-side in `irveFeed.js` and `irveDepartements.js`, and pinned
 * there against captured payloads. This module is presentation.

/**
 * Power ramp, five rungs, ORDERED IN LIGHTNESS.
 *
 * ── WHY THE OLD RAMP WAS REPLACED, IN NUMBERS ──────────────────────────────
 *
 * The previous ramp was `#4c6ef5 #22b8cf #94d82d #fab005 #fa5252` and it was
 * chosen as "cold to hot", which is a HUE story. B4 is blunt about hue: *« la
 * variation de couleur est uniquement différenciatrice […] l'œil ne peut pas
 * établir d'ordre »*. An ordered scale has to vary in VALUE. Measured in CIE
 * L* on the shipped hexes:
 *
 *     lente 51.0 → normale 68.8 → accelere 79.4 → rapide 76.9 → hpc 58.9
 *
 * The ladder climbs, then turns round and falls 20 points. Converted to greys
 * — B4's own test — the fastest charging in France reads DARKER than the
 * slowest, and `rapide` reads darker than `accelere`. The ramp was not an
 * ordering, it was five hues in an order only the legend knew.
 *
 * Two of those five inks were also already spoken for elsewhere on this globe,
 * exactly: `#4c6ef5` is Sitadel's « Travaux achevés » (`sitadelFeed.js:314`)
 * and `#7c8899` is the schools layer's « autre » (`schoolsFrance.js:290`).
 *
 * ── WHAT REPLACES IT, AND HOW IT WAS CHECKED ───────────────────────────────
 *
 * A monotonic value ramp, blue → cyan → teal → green → chartreuse, every rung
 * at least 9 L* above the one below:
 *
 *     54.1 → 63.3 → 72.3 → 81.7 → 90.9     (Δ 9.2 · 9.0 · 9.4 · 9.3)
 *
 * B4's two tests pass rather than being asserted. Greyscale: 54 < 63 < 72 < 82
 * < 91, the order survives. Deuteranopia (Viénot 1999): 40 → 46 → 52 → 68 →
 * 93, still strictly increasing.
 *
 * B3's test — *« deux classes adjacentes restent-elles séparables une fois
 * compositées ? »* — run at the mark's own alpha over four control backdrops
 * (eau `#12324f`, forêt `#2f4a24`, urbain clair `#c8c4bc`, toit `#7d5b4f`).
 * Smallest adjacent ΔE76 of the sixteen pairs: **35.5**, against a
 * just-noticeable difference of about 2.3.
 *
 * ── AND WHY THE WHOLE LADDER SITS IN THE LIGHT HALF ────────────────────────
 *
 * The first version of this ramp ran 30.6 → 83.0, which satisfies every rule
 * above with room to spare and was still wrong on a map. A reader looked at
 * the shipped plates over Bordeaux and said the colours were too dark to pick
 * out — and the arithmetic agrees: `lente` at L\* 30.6 and `normale` at 48.7
 * are **46 % of the sites in a French city**, and a dark plate inside a dark
 * casing over photographic imagery is a dark blob whatever its hue.
 *
 * A lightness ramp has a floor problem no amount of chroma fixes: B4 wants the
 * value to carry the order, and the bottom of a value range is by definition
 * dark. The resolution is to spend the ORDER on the light half only. Between
 * L\* 54 — the darkest a plate can be and still read against a dark basemap —
 * and L\* 91 — the lightest it can be without becoming white — there are 37
 * points for four gaps, so the ladder is 9.2 apart rather than 13. That is
 * tighter and it is enough, and it buys a floor 23.5 L\* higher and a
 * composited separation that went from 21.4 to 35.5.
 *
 * Against the 415 distinct inks the rest of `src/data` uses, the nearest
 * neighbour of any rung is ΔE 4.4 — `rapide` against `cadastreFeed.js`'s
 * `#7ee787`. That one is deliberately not opened up: the cadastre ink is a
 * PARCEL OUTLINE, a hairline on a polygon boundary, and this is a 26 px filled
 * pastille with a dark casing and a bolt punched through it. Two different
 * mark types at four ΔE are not a confusion; washing the rung out to 40 chroma
 * to satisfy the number would have made a real one, against its own neighbours.
 *
 * ── AND `inconnue` LEAVES THE RAMP ALTOGETHER ──────────────────────────────
 *
 * It was neutral slate at L* 56.3, sitting 2.6 L* from `hpc` at 58.9: the one
 * class that means "we could not read this" was, in greys, the same mark as
 * the fastest charging in the country. The refusal graphite measures L* 54.8,
 * which is now the bottom of the ramp rather than the middle of it — so it is
 * as findable as any measured band, and what tells it apart is its SHAPE. D3 asks for a MOTIF and not a tint
 * where a value is refused, so the mark is now a HOLLOW RING — see
 * {@link IRVE_UNKNOWN_INK} — and the ink is the graphite this repo already
 * reserves for a refusal. A motif is also the one encoding that survives the
 * NVG and FLIR passes.

 * the maillage, which is the regime a reader spends most of their zoom range
 * in, the whole encoding was worth **0.44 px**: a 2-plug car park drew 3.99 px
 * and a 6-plug one 4.43 px, and the 9 px ceiling needed 178 charge points to
 * reach. A channel nobody can read is not a quiet channel, it is a channel
 * that is spent — and the same figure now moves the BEAM, where it is worth
 * 13.5 px over the same pair.
 *
 * ── AND THEN THE MARK ITSELF COULD NOT BE FOUND ────────────────────────────
 *
 * Freeing the size channel is not the same as making the mark legible, and the
 * first attempt conflated the two: the disc was pinned at a constant 7 px, down
 * from a 14 px ceiling, on the reasoning that the beam was now doing the
 * seeing. Over Bordeaux at 12 653 m, straight down, on photorealistic imagery,
 * that produced **318 marks nobody could find** — including, when it was put in
 * front of them, the person who wrote it.
 *
 * The beam could not cover for it, and the reason is geometric rather than
 * incidental: a beam is a WORLD vertical, so its screen length is
 * `L · cos(tangage)`, and in that same view the shortest beam on screen was
 * **1.1 px**. Beams survive at the edges of the frame and die in the middle,
 * which is where a reader looks. The mark has to stand on its own at every
 * camera attitude.
 *
 * So the disc became a PLATE with a bolt punched out of it — the treatment
 * `militarySiteIcons.js` and `plantFiliereIcons.js` each arrived at against
 * their own measurements, and `irveMarkIcons.js` carries the argument. What
 * stays true is the A3 claim above: the plate says WHERE, never HOW MANY.
 *
 * ── ITS SIZE IS A LEGIBILITY RULE, AND IT HOLDS AN INK BUDGET ──────────────
 *
 * A 26 px plate is right for a market town and wrong for a city: 2 575 sites
 * inside 0.35° of central Paris at that size would lay 130 % of the canvas in
 * plate. The first curve fell linearly with the in-view COUNT, on the beam's
 * own anchors, and that was the wrong variable — a plate's cost is its AREA, so
 * a rule linear in the count overshoots exactly in the middle of the range,
 * where most views live. Measured over Bordeaux: 602 marks drew 28.1 % of the
 * frame.
 *
 * The size therefore holds an INK BUDGET: `√(budget / count)`, clamped between
 * a legibility floor and a ceiling. Coverage is then flat at
 * {@link IRVE_MARK_INK_BUDGET} — 15.6 % of the app's own 1 440 × 900 viewport —
 * from the ceiling right down to the floor, and the canvas is read rather than
 * assumed, so a small window gets smaller plates instead of a solid mat.
 *
 * BELOW THE FLOOR THE ANSWER IS THE FILTER, NOT A SMALLER PLATE. The floor
 * takes over at **792 marks** — past that the budget asks for less than 16 px,
 * and at the densest real viewport in France it asks for 9, which is back under
 * the size nobody could find. The floor holds at
 * {@link IRVE_MARK_DENSE_PX} and that view simply is full — which is a finding
 * about central Paris, not a defect — and the row now carries four power-floor
 * chips that take it from 2 575 marks to a few hundred. G1's filter is the
 * answer to saturation; shrinking the mark below legibility is not.
 *
 * This is not a second encoding (A3): it says nothing about any one site, it is
 * the same answer to "how much room is there", and `amenitiesFrance.js` states
 * the identical rule in its own words. Both regimes draw the same plate: a
 * charge point is a charge point, and which UNIT is being counted is a question
 * the key, the card and the row line answer in words.

/* ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * THE BEAMS — lifting the marker off a basemap we do not control
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * A 7–14 px dot with a one-pixel outline is legible against a basemap you
 * choose and against nothing else. This layer draws over OSM, Plan IGN, IGN
 * ortho and Bing aerial, and on ortho a coloured dot the size of a parked car
 * is simply part of the texture. The fix used elsewhere in this console is to
 * stand the marker UP: a short vertical beam has a length and a direction that
 * no aerial photograph contains, so it reads as an overlay at any zoom, over
 * any surface.
 *
 * ── WHY A RECYCLED POLYLINE COLLECTION AND NOT ENTITIES ─────────────────────
 *
 * The two stem implementations already in this repo — the submarine cables and
 * the shared `createLocalGeoJsonLayer` factory — both build their stems ONCE
 * from a bundled file and never rebuild: 2 629 and 7 464 of them, added at load
 * and left alone. This layer is the opposite. Its record set is rebuilt on
 * every camera settle behind a 450 ms debounce, and the densest real viewport
 * in France (a 0.35° box over central Paris, measured live: 5 253 grouped rows
 * → 2 575 distinct sites) would mean up to 2 575 entity add/remove per pan —
 * a workload neither precedent has ever run, and precisely the shape of the
 * hitch the cable layer documented and removed.
 *
 * So the beams live in a `PolylineCollection` that is allocated once and
 * RECYCLED: a rebuild rewrites positions and colours on the polylines that
 * already exist and hides the surplus. Nothing is destroyed, nothing is
 * re-created, and the collection converges on the largest view the session has
 * seen. `PolylineCollection.update` takes its partial-buffer `writeUpdate`
 * path when only positions moved and the vertex count is unchanged — which,
 * for a two-vertex beam, is every rebuild.
 *
 * ── WHY THEY GET SHORTER AS THE VIEW GETS BUSIER ────────────────────────────
 *
 * 2 575 vertical beams inside one city do not read as markers; they read as a
 * hedge. The cables' 2 629 are spread over every ocean on Earth and the
 * airports' 7 464 over the whole planet — this layer's worst case is all of
 * them inside 39 km. The beam therefore has a length BUDGET that falls as the
 * in-view count rises (see {@link irveBeamTargetPx}), so a quiet market town
 * gets a tall obvious marker and central Paris gets a short bristle that still
 * lifts the dot off the tarmac without becoming a wall.
 */

/**
 * Beam length in pixels for a sparse view, and for a saturated one.
 *
 * CALIBRATED AGAINST THE REGIMES, not against a guess. The first attempt used
 * a 14 px floor reached at 1 600 markers, on the reasoning that the densest
 * real viewport in France holds ~2 575 sites. It was wrong in practice for a
 * reason a browser found and arithmetic did not: the MESH regime is capped at
 * 2 200 dots and covers most of the useful zoom range, so every mesh view
 * saturated the budget and drew the minimum. Measured over Paris at 9 km that
 * is a ~100 m beam — about 8 px — which at 0.62 alpha over an OSM basemap is
 * indistinguishable from nothing. The beams were rendering perfectly and were
 * invisible, which is the failure this whole change exists to fix.
 *
 * The saturation point now sits above the mesh cap so a mesh view is not
 * automatically on the floor, and the floor itself was raised twice against a
 * measurement rather than a taste. Counting the pixels a beam actually changes
 * on a 1 200×800 canvas over central Paris at 2 200 markers:
 *
 *     406 m of beam (26 px budget)     3 186 px   present, but faint
 *     406 m, drawn fat and opaque     11 406 px   width is NOT the lever
 *   3 000 m, shipped width and alpha  81 595 px   unmistakable — and a hedge
 *
 * Height dominates by a factor of twenty-five and width barely moves it, so the
 * budget is where the tuning belongs. 3 000 m covers 8.5 % of the canvas, which
 * is the wall the recon warned about; the shipped 38–64 px band sits between
 * the two, roughly doubling the faint case without approaching the wall.
 *
 * The last word on this belongs to a real browser on the staging URL. A
 * software rasteriser at 1 200×800 is not where a judgement about whether a
 * marker reads should be made, and this comment records the numbers so the
 * next adjustment starts from data instead of from taste.

 * THE HEIGHT BECOMES THE COUNT — B2, and the channel that was empty
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * B2 says the screen SIZE of a mark on a globe is already spoken for by depth,
 * so a quantity belongs on the vertical. This layer had a 64 px vertical
 * channel — the tallest, most visible thing it draws — and it carried the
 * NUMBER OF MARKERS ON SCREEN. Measured over the Basque Country: 960 beams,
 * all of them 55.8 px, differing in nothing. The biggest channel on the map
 * said the same word 960 times.
 *
 * Meanwhile the count of charge points — the one number a reader of this layer
 * wants — was on the disc diameter, worth 0.44 px between a 2-plug car park
 * and a 6-plug one. The information does not appear here; it MOVES, from
 * 0.44 px of diameter to 13.5 px of height over the same pair.
 *
 * ── SQUARE ROOT, AND THE MEASUREMENT THAT FORCED IT ────────────────────────
 *
 * Measured over the 40 028 sites of 2026-09-10: median 4 charge points, p75 6,
 * p90 10, p95 16, p99 33, max 606 (SAEMES under the Madeleine). A 1 : 606
 * domain. On a LINEAR rule with a 24-plug domain the floor would swallow
 * everything under 3 plugs, which is **57 % of the register**; pulled down to
 * a 12-plug domain to save the floor, the top clips **6.7 %** of sites. Either
 * way one end of the scale stops being a scale for a large share of the map.
 *
 * The square root escapes both: a 1-plug site draws 13.1 px — visible, and no
 * floor is needed — and the domain reaches 24 plugs, above **98.1 %** of
 * sites. It is also the mode `choroplethPrism.js` already publishes and
 * already has a legend sentence for, so the national prism regime and this one
 * speak the same grammar. The cost is stated in the key, in that module's own
 * words: *deux fois plus haut vaut quatre fois plus*.
 *
 *     1 plug 13.1 px · 2 → 18.5 · 4 → 26.1 · 6 → 32.0 · 12 → 45.3 · 24+ → 64
 *
 * ── AND THE RULE IS NOT IN PIXELS UNTIL IT IS CORRECTED FOR PITCH ──────────
 *
 * A beam is vertical IN THE WORLD, so what a reader measures on screen is
 * `L · cos(pitch)` — 87 % of it at the −30° the globe opens on, 50 % at −60°,
 * and NOTHING at the nadir, where a vertical line projects to a point. A key
 * that printed a pixel ruler would therefore be wrong the moment anybody
 * tilted. {@link irveBeamPitchScale} divides it back out, clamped at −70°
 * because the correction diverges at the nadir; past that the key stops
 * claiming a ruler and says to tilt.

/* ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * THE KEY — one question, six answers
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * WHAT WAS ON SCREEN BEFORE, measured in Chrome over a city view on
 * 2026-09-14: **13 rows, 301 words and 717 px of content in a 355 px window**
 * — the reader saw half a key, and its closing sentence never at all. Thirteen rows for six classes, because the key
 * also carried the beam's reading ruler — four ticks quoted IN PIXELS, « 64 px
 * de haut » — two channel headers with a paragraph each (the square root, the
 * pitch correction and its 70° limit, deuteranopia, the frozen class bounds),
 * the register's provenance and filing date, and a closing sentence on how a
 * site key is minted from 127 station ids at one coordinate.
 *
 * Every one of those is true, and none of them is what the reader came for.
 * **The reader of this key is looking for somewhere to plug in**; the screen
 * height of a beam is an author's question. So the key answers ONE question —
 * what does the colour mean — and the rest moves to surfaces that are one
 * click away and that already carried it:
 *
 *   - the filing date and « capacité installée, jamais la disponibilité » are
 *     on the site card, verbatim, in {@link buildIrveSelectionLabel};
 *   - the publisher is named in the attribution surface by `dataCredits.js`
 *     (`irve-charge-points` → transport.data.gouv.fr, ODRÉ);
 *   - the beam's register (F7 a) and its ceiling (A5) are declared on that
 *     same card, beside the exact charge-point figure that decodes them,
 *     rather than as a four-rung ruler in a key;
 *   - the maillage cell's size in degrees and in km (C2, C3) is the first line
 *     of {@link buildIrveMeshLabel}, and the sampling ratio is on the row.
 *
 * WHAT STAYS, because nothing else on screen says it: the six classes with
 * their bounds in kW and their counts (D1), the refused class as a hollow ring
 * rather than a tint (D3), the maillage's mark-to-site ratio (A5), and — only
 * when a power floor is actually hiding marks — one line saying how many, and
 * why slower classes survive it. Measured after, same view: **7 rows, 46 words
 * and 215 px, inside a 262 px window** — nothing clipped.
