/**
 * Build `config/pan_gtfs_rt_feeds.json` — the shipped index of French
 * GTFS-Realtime **vehicle position** feeds published on the Point d'Accès
 * National, https://transport.data.gouv.fr (the national access point France
 * operates under EU regulation 2017/1926).
 *
 * Source:   GET https://transport.data.gouv.fr/api/datasets  (public, keyless)
 * Licences: carried per feed, verbatim from the catalog (`lov2` = Licence
 *           Ouverte 2.0, `odc-odbl` = ODbL 1.0, …). No dataset is re-licensed
 *           here; the index only records what the publisher declared.
 *
 * WHY THE INDEX IS SHIPPED: the catalog publishes coverage as a NAME
 * ("epci: Bordeaux Métropole"), never as a bounding box, so a viewport-driven
 * layer has no way to ask "which feeds are on screen". The only non-inventive
 * footprint is the OBSERVED one — where a feed's vehicles actually were when
 * it was probed — and probing 150 feeds is a minute of wall clock that must
 * not sit in front of a user's first frame. So it is done here, once, and
 * committed. The dev-server proxy keeps growing these bounds at runtime.
 *
 * WHAT AN OBSERVED BBOX IS AND IS NOT: it is a measurement of one moment. A
 * network's real service area is at least as large as its box; an off-peak
 * probe sees less of it, and a network with no vehicles running at probe time
 * gets `bbox: null` and is carried in the index without one (the proxy gives
 * such feeds a small rotating allowance so they can reveal themselves later).
 * Junk fixes are fenced out before measuring — see `boundsOfVehicles` — because
 * one bus reported in the Sahara turns a city footprint into half a continent.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node scripts/build-pan-gtfs-rt-index.mjs [--concurrency=8] [--timeout=20000]
 *                                            [--catalog=path/to/datasets.json]
 *                                            [--out=config/pan_gtfs_rt_feeds.json]
 *                                            [--no-probe]
 *
 * `--no-probe` refreshes descriptors from the catalog while KEEPING the bounds
 * already in the output file — use it to pick up new networks without
 * re-measuring every footprint.
 *
 * THREE THINGS THE CATALOG DOES NOT SAY, MEASURED HERE. The first two live
 * under `src/data/panFeedHealth.js`; all three are recorded per feed:
 *
 *   - `duplicateOf` — some networks publish one body under two resource ids.
 *     Measured 2026-08-31, Kicéo's two resources returned the same 62 vehicles
 *     at the same 62 coordinates and Lila presqu'île's the same 14; each was
 *     drawn twice. A candidate found in the first probe pass is RE-PROBED, and
 *     only a second agreement is recorded — resources that merely looked alike
 *     for one moment are kept.
 *
 *   - `health` — a run of failed probes quarantines a feed out of viewport
 *     selection. Between 2026-08-26 and 2026-08-31, seven resources began
 *     answering HTTP 403 behind a WAF and one HTTP 500. Nothing is deleted: a
 *     single successful probe in any later build clears the quarantine.
 *
 *   - `tripUpdates` / `alerts` — WHICH resource carries this feed's delays and
 *     which carries its disruptions. Every one of the 150 datasets publishes
 *     trip updates and 60 publish alerts, but the catalog never says which
 *     resource pairs with which position feed, and a dataset can publish
 *     several of each: Astuce ships three position feeds and four trip-update
 *     feeds, one per operator, on interleaved ids. So candidates are probed
 *     and the winner is the one whose trips actually JOIN the vehicles this
 *     feed just reported — the measured join rate ships with it.
