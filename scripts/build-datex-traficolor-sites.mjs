/**
 * Build `config/datex_traficolor_sites.json` — the geometry the live French
 * road-status layer is drawn on.
 *
 * THE PROBLEM. Bison Futé publishes the STATE of the national road network
 * (`TRAFICOLOR-DIR`, a colour per site, every 60–360 s) and the COUNT on it
 * (`QTV-DIR`, veh/h and km/h per station, every 6 min) as two streams of site
 * IDENTIFIERS. Neither carries a coordinate. The only geometry on the server
 * is `QTV-DIR/refDir.csv`, and that file has three properties that make
 * reading it at runtime a mistake:
 *
 *   1. **It is in Lambert-93.** Projected metres, which nothing on a globe can
 *      use. Reprojection is exact and cheap (`scripts/lib/lambert93.mjs`), but
 *      it has no business happening in a browser once per session forever.
 *
 *   2. **It is not a referential.** It is regenerated with every six-minute
 *      publication cycle and its row set MOVES: measured on 2026-08-31, one
 *      cycle carried 1 197 stations and the next 1 192, five having dropped
 *      out. A station that stops reporting for a cycle takes its geometry with
 *      it, so a client reading the live file would watch segments blink out of
 *      existence for reasons that have nothing to do with the road.
 *
 *   3. **It lies about its own shape.** The header declares twenty columns and
 *      every single row publishes nineteen — `code_insee_commune` is absent.
 *      A reader that zips rows against the header shifts every field from the
 *      fourth onward, reads `nb_voies` as an easting, and concludes that most
 *      of the network is unlocatable. It is not: 836 of 1 197 stations carry
 *      real coordinates, and 834 carry a full start AND end pair, which is why
 *      this layer can draw 936 km of SEGMENTS rather than a field of dots.
 *
 * SO THE GEOMETRY IS BUILT ONCE, HERE, AND COMMITTED. Reprojected to WGS84,
 * validated against the projection's own area of use, and accumulated: each
 * run UNIONS what it sees with what the committed file already holds, so
 * re-running the script recovers stations that happened to be absent from the
 * cycle a previous run caught. Nothing is ever silently dropped — a station
 * present in the file and absent from today's cycle keeps its geometry and is
 * counted in `stats.carriedOver`.
 *
 * WHAT IS COMMITTED. Per site: the DIR that operates it, its road, its
 * traficolor zone, and its two endpoints at five decimals (~1 m). Nothing
 * else, and no measurement — flow, speed and colour are live values that would
 * be stale before the commit landed.
 *
 * AND WHAT HAS NO COORDINATE IS ASKED FOR ITS ADDRESS INSTEAD. A row with no
 * `x_deb` is not necessarily a row with no geometry: 153 of the 525 that
 * publish no coordinate publish a POINT REPÈRE — the kilometre post the French
 * road network is addressed by — and every post of the non-conceded network is
 * published with its Lambert-93 position in a second open dataset, the
 * `Bornage du réseau routier national`. Resolving one against the other
 * (`scripts/lib/rrnBornage.mjs`) recovers all 115 stations of DIR Ouest, 26 of
 * DIR Atlantique, 10 of DIR Centre-Est and 2 of DIR Est.
 *
 * That join is CALIBRATED on every run rather than trusted: 831 stations
 * publish an address AND a coordinate, so the build resolves their address too
 * and prints the disagreement. On 2026-09-01 it was p50 3.9 m, p90 7.3 m,
 * max 64 m — the DIRs derive their own coordinates from this referential, and
 * a future edition that stopped agreeing would move that number, in the build
 * log, before it moved a station on screen.
 *
 * THE SAME KEY LIGHTS FOUR DARK CITIES. The Breton traffic centres (Nantes,
 * Rennes, Saint-Brieuc, Lorient–Vannes) publish TRAFICOLOR under identifiers
 * that appear in no referential row — which is why they were drawn nowhere —
 * but those identifiers ARE point-repère addresses: `35A0084T096_00D` is
 * département 35, route A84, PR 96, abscissa 0, right-hand carriageway. 602 of
 * their 619 sites resolve, and are added to the file as status-only sites with
 * no counting station behind them.
 *
 * WHAT IS STILL NOT LOCATABLE, AND SAID SO. DIR Nord (163 stations, Lille) and
 * DIR Est (Nancy–Metz) publish rows with no coordinate AND no address, under
 * identifiers that are operator codes rather than addresses — the two readings
 * of the Lille codes that fit the bornage at all put its A1 sensors in
 * département 95, inside Île-de-France. Those sites stay in the file with
 * `c: null` so the proxy can report "this agglomeration's state is published,
 * its position is not" instead of silently showing an empty map over Lille.
