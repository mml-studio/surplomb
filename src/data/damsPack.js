/*
 * DAMS PACK — the shared vocabulary of the bundled OpenStreetMap dam snapshot.
 *
 * Two callers, one file, so they cannot drift:
 *   - scripts/build-osm-dams.mjs PROJECTS Overpass elements (and the retained
 *     world snapshot) into src/data/local_data/dams/dams.geojsonl.
 *   - src/data/localGeojson.js READS the shipped properties back to write the
 *     ambient card, the marker style and the label rank for `local-dams`.
 *
 * Everything here is pure — no Cesium, no fs, no network — so the build script
 * and the browser both import it as-is. Same contract as ./airportsPack.js next
 * door, and for the same reason: a field the build stops emitting has to become
 * a failing test, not a blank line on the globe.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS AT ALL
 * ---------------------------
 * The pack it describes used to be 704 features for the whole planet, decoded
 * out of an Open Infrastructure Map POWER-PLANT layer and filtered on a dam
 * tag. In France that left 44 objects — so in a France fork "Barrages" was a
 * row you switched on to watch nothing happen. The French half is now a direct
 * OSM extraction of the dam STRUCTURES themselves (5.5k of them, overseas
 * départements and collectivités included); the rest of the world is the old
 * snapshot, kept so that turning the layer on outside France does not empty it.
 * Both halves are OpenStreetMap, ODbL 1.0, and both pass through the projection
 * below — one shape, one card, one ladder.
 *
 * WHAT "BARRAGE" MEANS HERE, AND WHAT IT DOES NOT
 * -----------------------------------------------
 * It means `waterway=dam`, `man_made=dam` or `building=dam` in OpenStreetMap —
 * a volunteer's judgement about a structure, not an entry in a national
 * register. France's own register (the ROE, ~100k obstacles à l'écoulement) is
 * an order of magnitude larger and is NOT this. Nor is a dam a power station:
 * the usine that a barrage feeds is a different object, usually mapped
 * separately, and it is the subject of the `edf-power-plants`, `fr-hydro-plants`
 * and `rte-generation` layers. Nothing is joined between them.
 *
 * ── SIZE: WHAT THE PACK CAN CARRY, AND WHAT IT CANNOT ───────────────────────
 *
 * OSM publishes `height` and `length` on a `waterway=dam`, and the obvious move
 * was to put one of them on the size channel. Measured on the shipped pack
 * before writing a line of it:
 *
 *     heightM   143 of 6 840   2.09 %
 *     spanM   5 328 of 6 840  77.89 %
 *
 * `height` is REFUSED. At 2.1 % coverage a height-driven size would be a map
 * of 143 objects and 6 697 defaults, and the 143 are not a sample of anything —
 * they are the barrages somebody thought worth measuring, which is the ladder
 * `damTier` already reads. `length` is not shipped at all: the allowlist in
 * {@link damFeatureProperties} never carried it.
 *
 * What IS carried is `spanM` — the longest straight-line dimension, measured
 * off the mapped geometry at build time, on 71.7 % of the pack. It is a metre
 * count of the object itself rather than a tag somebody typed, and it spans
 * 25 m → 6 399 m (median 100, p95 539). That is the absolute quantity B1 asks
 * for, so it takes the size channel.
 *
 * The four classes are FROZEN DOMAIN thresholds (C1), never quantiles of what
 * is on screen — 100 m, 300 m and 1 000 m, with their measured populations:
 *
 *     ≥ 1 000 m       116   1.70 %
 *     300 – 999 m     439   6.42 %
 *     100 – 299 m   2 132  31.17 %
 *     25 – 99 m     2 641  38.61 %
 *     not measured  1 512  22.11 %   (of which 68 are the world tail, which
 *                                     shipped without geometry to measure)
 *
 * The 1 512 get a HOLLOW ring, not the smallest disc (A1): "not measured" and
 * "short" are not the same statement, and 22 % of the layer is too much of it
 * to leave silently indistinguishable. That ring is the ONE size row the key
 * prints; the four bands are read off the card, which gives the metre count
 * itself rather than the bracket it falls in.
 *
 * Constant PIXELS, not world units, and deliberately the opposite choice from
 * `datacentersPack.js` next door: a dam's span is a length along an axis this
 * pack does not ship — 5 576 of the features are a single point — so there is
 * no true-size shape to draw. A constant-pixel disc is then the only honest
 * quantitative mark, and it is safe here precisely because this renderer sets
 * `PointGraphics.pixelSize` and never a `scaleByDistance`: nothing composes
 * with it (B2).
 *
 * ── WHAT THE SIZE CHANNEL USED TO CARRY ─────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The tier — 13 / 9 / 6 px for major / named / minor — and the stem width with
 * it. Both are gone. Importance was being said three times (dot size, stem
 * width, card range) and measured never, which is A3 twice over and B1 once.
 * Tier now lives entirely on the two channels that were already its own and
 * that no other variable competes for: the label ladder's priority and the
 * distance at which a card stops being offered ({@link DAM_TIERS} `priority`
 * and `cardMaxDistance`), plus the mark's own range. Colour is untouched — it
 * still says WHAT the structure is.

/**
 * The Overpass tag filters the pack is extracted with. The selection policy IS
 * this query — plus one documented exclusion in the build script — so it lives
 * here beside the code that reads the result back.
 *
 * `man_made=dam` and `building=dam` are kept alongside the canonical
 * `waterway=dam` because 55 French structures carry only one of those two, and
 * dropping them would lose real barrages to a tagging preference.
 *
 * ── WHY DYKES ARE HERE NOW, AND WEIRS ARE NOT ───────────────────────────────
 *
 * A digue and a barrage are different objects. OSM says so unambiguously —
 * `waterway=dam` is "a barrier built ACROSS a river", `man_made=dyke` is "an
 * embankment built to restrict the flow of water", running PARALLEL to it —
 * and the layer was drawing them as one thing. Not hypothetically: 25 features
 * in the shipped pack already carry `man_made=dyke` (they got in because they
 * also carry `waterway=dam`), 26 are literally named "Digue …", and SEVEN of
 * those are promoted to the top tier and labelled "Grand barrage", because the
 * `name AND span ≥ 300 m` clause cannot tell a 1 106 m dyke from a dam.
 *
 * `embankment=dyke` is included alongside `man_made=dyke` because it is the
 * wiki-documented tag for a dyke that also carries a road, and ~96 French
 * dykes are findable only through it.
 *
 * WEIRS ARE DELIBERATELY LEFT OUT, for now. France has 7 704 `waterway=weir`
 * against 5 519 `waterway=dam`, so adding them would more than double a layer
 * called "Barrages" with objects most readers would not call one, and the
 * dam-versus-weir boundary is a mapper's judgement about overtopping rather
 * than a survey. That is a separate decision from the one this pack is making,
 * which is that a dyke is not a dam. See `DAM_STRUCTURES` for what the tier
 * label used to claim about weirs, and stopped claiming.
 *
 * `man_made=embankment` (14 169 in France) is NOT a dyke tag — the wiki lists
 * it as a raised bank carrying rail or road — and including it would bury the
 * layer under railway embankments.

/**
 * The three tiers, most important first. This array IS the order: the legend
 * renders it top-down.
 *
 * It carries NO `pixelSize` and no `stemWidth` any more — see "WHAT THE SIZE
 * CHANNEL USED TO CARRY" at the top of this file. What is left is what tier
 * legitimately owns: a label-grid priority and the two LOD distances.
 *
 * ── THE TWO DISTANCES, AND WHY THE SECOND ONE REPLACED A CHIP ───────────────
 *
 * `cardMaxDistance` is how far out the NAME is still offered. `markerMaxDistance`
 * is how far out the MARK is drawn at all. The second is new, and it exists
 * because it does the ONE job the old TOUS / NOMMÉS / GRANDS chip row actually
 * did — thin 6 771 French structures down to something readable — without
 * asking a reader to learn three words for it.
 *
 * The chips were removed rather than retuned, and the measurement is why.
 * `GRANDS` kept 494 French features, but not because they are big: only 65 of
 * them carry a height at all. The tier's OR admits anything hydroelectric, so
 * "GRANDS" was a hydro filter wearing a size label — A3, and a chip that named
 * the wrong fact. What is left says nothing and asks nothing: a pond outlet
 * arrives when its département fills the frame, a named barrage when its
 * région does, Serre-Ponçon from orbit.
 *
 * 900 km for `minor` is the airports pack's number and the same derivation:
 * France spans about 1 000 km, and at ~870 km a 1 000 km span fills a 1080 px
 * viewport. The 5 744 unnamed seuils therefore arrive exactly when France has
 * stopped being the subject of the frame — which matters more here than next
 * door, because after the 2026-09 hydro migration this pack is 6 840 features
 * of which 6 771 are French. Drawn from orbit it would report a dam density
 * that belongs to the SELECTION and not to the world.
 *
 * `named` is set to about 2.5× its card range, so the mark always precedes the
 * name it belongs to rather than arriving with it. `major` keeps the shared
 * local-layer ceiling on both: a grand barrage is readable from orbit and its
 * mark has to be there to be read.
 *
 * Colours are one blue ramp — these are three grades of one thing — around the
 * layer's historical `#0088ff`, and clear of cyan (datacenters), amber (ports)
 * and violet (airports), which share the one `ambient-card` collision group.

 *     SIZE     how long it is    the measured span, in constant pixels

 *
 * The colour/tier split is forced by the renderer as much as chosen:
 * `createLocalGeoJsonLayer` resolves ONE group key per feature at load and
 * bakes its colour into the Cesium primitives, so anything that must vary per
 * feature has to live in that key. Hence a composite `kind:tier`. Size does
 * NOT travel in it — it comes from {@link damRenderSpec}, per feature.
 *
 * The dyke ramp is ochre — earth, which is what a dyke is made of — and stays
 * clear of the blues this layer already spends on dams, of cyan (datacenters),
 * amber (ports) and violet (airports), which share the one `ambient-card`
