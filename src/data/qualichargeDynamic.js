 * @description The one feed that says whether a French charge point is FREE
 * RIGHT NOW — and the reading rules that keep it from lying.
 *
 * ── Why this exists next to `irveFeed.js` ──────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `irveFeed.js` reads the *fichier consolidé* — a static register of where the
 * plugs are, and it says out loud, three times over, that it is not an
 * availability feed: "Capacité installée — ce fichier ne publie pas la
 * disponibilité". That was true of every national file until QualiCharge.
 *
 * QualiCharge is the DGEC's aggregation API. Connecting to it is COMPULSORY
 * for any DC charge-point operator claiming renewable-electricity certificates,
 * which is why a voluntary-looking feed nonetheless covers the fast network:
 * measured 2026-09-07, **75 427 points de charge**, one row per plug, 6.08 MB
 * of CSV (1.17 MB gzipped, 320 ms), CORS-open, Licence Ouverte 2.0.
 *
 * It publishes ONLY the current state. Each poll replaces the last, no history
 * is kept anywhere, and no third party sells one. `chronicle.js` is what turns
 * it into a past.
 *
 * ── Trap 1: a third of the file is not about now ───────────────────────────
 *
 * `horodatage` is when the operator last SPOKE about that plug, not when the
 * file was built, and it reaches back years. Measured 2026-09-07 16:37 UTC
 * over all 75 427 rows:
 *
 *   within 1 h    17 786   23.6 %
 *   within 6 h    40 915   54.2 %
 *   within 24 h   51 230   67.9 %
 *   within 7 d    62 796   83.3 %
 *   within 30 d   67 737   89.8 %
 *   oldest                 862 days — a state assertion from 2024
 *
 * And the stale rows are not stale-and-silent, they are stale-and-CONFIDENT:
 * of the 24 197 rows outside 24 hours, **18 052 still say `libre`** and only
 * 858 say `occupe`. Counting the file as it stands gives 58 742 free plugs;
 * counting only what has been re-affirmed within a day gives 40 690. A naive
 * reading inflates France's free charging capacity by **44.4 %**, and it does
 * so in one direction — an operator that goes silent goes silent while its
 * plugs are idle.
 *
 * So every share this module publishes is computed over the FRESH rows only,
 * and the fresh count travels with them ({@link QUALICHARGE_FRESH_MS}, 24 h).
 * The stale rows are counted too, under their own key, because "how much of
 * the network stopped reporting" is itself a measurement.
 *
 * ── Trap 2: the freshness clock is the FETCH, not `Date.now()` ─────────────
 *
 * No row in either captured file is stamped ahead of the instant its body
 * arrived — 0 of 75 426 and 0 of 75 427. But a first pass at this measurement
 * compared the file against a `now` taken a few minutes BEFORE the fetch and
 * "found" 1 252 rows from the future, all within three minutes. That is the
 * shape of the real bug: a body fetched at 12:00 and folded from cache at
 * 12:14 ages every row by fourteen minutes it did not live, and pushes the
 * plugs nearest the window's edge over it.
 *
 * So {@link qualichargeSamples} takes the FETCH instant as `now`, never the
 * caller's wall clock, and the age is `|now - stamp|` so that a publisher
 * whose clock genuinely runs ahead loses no rows either.
 *
 * ── Trap 3: the operator code is in the id, and 16 rows spell it differently ─
 *
 * `id_pdc_itinerance` follows AFIREV: two country letters, three operator
 * characters, an `E`, then the operator's own id — `FRS30E300320031` is
 * operator `FRS30`. Sixteen rows (all `FRV75PPX…`, the Ville de Paris) omit
 * the `E` separator entirely. Reading the first FIVE characters rather than
 * splitting on the `E` matches all 75 427 rows and puts those sixteen in the
 * `FRV75` bucket they belong to, alongside the other 1 940.
 *
 * Measured: **94 distinct operators**, 85 of them with 20 or more plugs. The
 * per-operator series is emitted only above {@link QUALICHARGE_OPERATOR_FLOOR}
 * because an occupancy share over three plugs is a coin toss, not a rhythm.
 *
 * Pure: no fetch, no clock of its own, no fs. `vite.config.js` polls, and
 * `chronicle.js` remembers.
