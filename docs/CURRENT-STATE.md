# Surplomb Current State

Updated: September 19, 2026

> **2026-09-19 — the globe is bilingual by construction.** `src/i18n/` holds the
> whole mechanism; `docs/i18n/CONVENTIONS.md` is the rulebook every translation
> batch follows. The locale is decided ONCE, by the inline `/* locale-gate */`
> script in `index.html` (after the vitrine gate, before the stylesheet):
> `window.__GEV_LOCALE__` (QA) › `?lang=fr|en` (remembered in `localStorage`
> under `gev:locale:v1`) › the stored choice › `navigator.languages` (OFF:
> `LOCALE_AUTO_DETECT = false` until the language switch ships) › French. It
> writes `<html lang>` and nothing else; every module reads the locale from
> that attribute through `getLocale()` and never from `navigator` (Node has one,
> and `npm test` must stay French on an en-US runner). Switching language is
> store + `shareLink.flushHash()` + reload (`switchLocale()`), so no module ever
> repaints itself. Strings live in co-located catalogs (`<module>.i18n.js`,
> `{ fr, en }` per message, read at CALL time — ratchet R5 holds load-time reads
> at zero); numbers and dates go through `src/i18n/format.js`, whose French
> output is byte-identical to `toLocaleString('fr-FR')`. `src/boot.js` imports
> the static-markup applicator (`data-i18n*` attributes, English in
> `src/i18n/markup.i18n.js`) only when the page is not French: the entry chunk
> grew by 367 B gzipped and a French page fetches nothing more. Guards:
> `src/i18n/i18nRatchet.test.mjs` against `src/i18n/i18n-baseline.json`
> (R1 French literals 4,611, R2 UI literals 1,738, R3 `index.html` text 406,
> R4 `toLocale*('fr-FR')` 135, R5 0 — a count may fall, never rise;
> `npm run i18n:report`, `npm run i18n:tighten`), and
> `src/i18n/messagesParity.test.mjs` over every catalog. QA pages pin their
> locale through `newQaPage()` (French unless `GEV_QA_LOCALE=en`), and
> `npm run qa:i18n-en` opens the English globe, unfolds its panels and reports
> the French a reader can still see (advisory; `--strict` fails).
>
> **Translated as of 2026-09-20 (waves 1 and the pilot):** the static shell and
> every panel (#285, with the FR/EN switch, browser detection and the A/B
> exclusion of non-French readers), the layer registry — 60 names, 7 groups,
> their source lines and the ACTIF/CHARGEMENT/ÉTEINT statuses, which harnesses
> now read through `data-feed-state` — the HUD, the loading screen, the zoom
> card and the credits (#286), the Address X-ray and the building cards (#283),
> real estate (#287), transport and mobility (#288), and the megafire pilot
> (#282). **Still French-only:** planning and land, crime and schools, health,
> amenities and telecoms, risks and environment, the shell's satellites
> (waitlist, phone sheet, legal links), and the voice with the server's error
> prose. Ratchets after wave 1: R1 2,958, R2 951, R3 0, R4 74.

> **2026-09-19 — the top of a phone, like Google Maps.** Under
> `html[data-shell="phone"]` only (`src/phoneSheet.js`, `phone.css`,
> markup `#phone-topbar` / `#phone-basemap-*` in `index.html`):
> the **search bar** is at the top, right of the logo — the
> `#location-search-form` form is adopted there, not copied; focus opens the
> *Recherche* (Search) panel (cities, landmarks) at `full`, under the bar, and
> a submit or a shortcut gives the map back (`peek`). The RECHERCHE (SEARCH)
> tab is hidden, its panel stays. Below it, a **row of chips**
> (`src/phoneLayerChips.js`): the eight *À LA UNE* (FEATURED) layers in a fixed
> order, switched on in place, preceded by any other row that is on, then
> *Toutes les couches* (All layers). A chip calls `dataManager.toggleRow()` and
> rereads `getPanelRowStates()` on every `visibility*` notification — the two
> public methods added to the manager. On the right, a **column of round
> buttons**: basemap, share, around me, globe; it fades out as soon as the
> sheet goes past `peek`. The **basemap** leaves the head of Layers for a panel
> of its own (`#phone-basemap-sheet`), as thumbnails: a real tile for
> Satellite, Plan IGN and OSM (`public/basemaps/`, see NOTICE.md), a pictogram
> for the five keyed basemaps. Rendering the globe on a phone is handled
> separately (`src/phoneRender.js`, #264).

> **2026-09-08 — the dataset box: a dataset is plugged in, no longer coded.**
> Contract and limits in `docs/DATASETS.md`; code in `src/data/dataset*.js`.
> Three doors: **＋ BRANCHER UN JEU DE DONNÉES** (＋ PLUG IN A DATASET) under
> the layer list (paste an address → draft → BRANCHER (PLUG IN), remembered in
> this browser under `gev:plugged-datasets:v1`), a `datasets/<id>.json` file
> (shipped to everyone at build time, validated by `datasetsCatalog.test.mjs`),
> and `npm run dataset:manifest -- <url>` — the command that follows a search
> on the data.gouv.fr MCP. Six adapters (`datasetSources.js`): GeoJSON,
> GeoJSONL, CSV, **data.gouv.fr through the tabular API** (pages of 200 typed
> rows, bounding-box filters on the position columns — never used in this
> repository before), WFS (`CRS:84`, measured against the Géoplateforme) and
> Opendatasoft (`in_bbox`). Everything starts from the browser: the French
> platforms answer with open CORS (measured); `/api/plug` is an allow-listed
> relay for those that refuse an `Origin` (INSEE), tried only after a direct
> attempt has failed.
>
> **What moved in the core.** `localGeojson.js` takes three hooks —
> `loadFeatures`, `cardCopy`, `invalidate` — and nothing else: a plugged
> dataset inherits the stems, cards, label arbitration and occlusion of the
> shipped packs. `manager.js` opens a door after the seal,
> `registerDataset()` / `unregisterDataset()`, which adds the taxonomy row
> derived from the manifest and redraws the panel; share tokens are NOT touched
> (a plugged dataset has none, and `docs/DATASETS.md` says why). A ninth group,
> `plugged` *JEUX BRANCHÉS* (PLUGGED DATASETS), empty at startup and without a
> header for as long as it stays empty. The voice enumeration stays byte for
> byte the same; the executor accepts any registered id, so `ds-<id>` can be
> commanded by voice.
>
> **What the row says** (CARTOGRAPHY A5, D1, F6, H1): *4 000 affichés sur
> 186 137 — plafond 4 000, premières lignes* (“4,000 shown of 186,137 —
> ceiling 4,000, first rows”), *42 dans la vue* (“42 in view”), *n sans
> position* (“n without a position”), *via relais* (“via relay”); beyond
> `maxSpanDeg` a dataset loaded for the view shows *rapprochez-vous* (“move
> closer”) as an instruction (`status: 'zoom-in'`), not as a failure. The
> legend carries one entry per group with its count.
>
> **One shipped manifest**: GeoDAE defibrillators (data.gouv.fr, per view), and
> it has no row of its own — its `fusion` block makes it a chip of *Santé &
> secours* (Health & emergency services), the doctors' row. License confirmed
> on the dataset page and carried in `DATA_SOURCES.md`. Two others were
> withdrawn for the same reason, which is the rule: **a manifest is not shipped
> for what a layer already draws.** The BD TOPO aerodrome footprints — the
> Aéroports layer ships 418 of them — and the remarkable trees of Paris, whose
> 183 are a tier of the Îlots de fraîcheur (Cool islands) layer, and since
> 2026-09-14 a REMARQUABLES (REMARKABLE) chip that loads them for the whole
> city without the 1,500 m limit that governs the rest of the canopy.
>
> **Verified**: 6,393 unit tests, 0 failures (60 new); `npm run
> qa:datasets -- --url … --deep` in a browser, 16 checks green: catalog on the
> panel, inference from an Opendatasoft page, plug/unplug through the API and
> through the form, a real load of the GeoDAE dataset plugged through the form
> (5,000 rows of the default view in 25 requests to the tabular API, capping
> declared), persistence across a reload.
> **Harness trap**: puppeteer's `page.click()` and screenshots time out on
> this page while `evaluate` answers in 1 ms — the harness clicks through the
> DOM and screenshots are opt-in (`--shots`).

> **2026-09-08 — the Site report says where the address stands in the
> country.** `src/data/baremeNational.js` carries eleven national scales
> measured by `npm run bareme:fr` on **1,200 ten-minute walking rings**, drawn
> with probability proportional to population over INSEE's 377,234 1 km grid
> cells (64,089,848 residents), zero refusals. The `Fiche implantation` (Site
> report) prints a **national percentile** per indicator and an **A→E letter**
> for the three whose meaning is not a matter of opinion. Method and
> measurements: #99.
>
> **Geometry is a join key, not a comment.** A value can only be ranked within
> a distribution measured on the same shape. Measured on the same sample, the
> interdecile range of a ring is **74%** of that of a 200 m grid cell: scored
> on `FILOSOFI_RAMPS`, a ring at the 10th percentile would read at the 22nd and
> a ring at the 90th at the 84th — one letter band off at each end. On a 5- or
> 15-minute ring, ring ranks are **refused and the card says so**; the price
> rank, measured on a 300 m disc, survives.
>
> **Eight indicators out of eleven have no letter.** A high price is good for a
> seller and bad for a buyer; a share of social housing is public policy. Those
> get a rank. The three that carry a letter state their convention on the same
> line.
>
> **A bug fell out of the measurement**: `implantationFeed.js` dropped the grid
> cell's `crs`, so every cell in Martinique or La Réunion landed in Hudson Bay
> and the report answered *aucun carreau INSEE habité* (“no inhabited INSEE
> grid cell”) for every overseas address. Fixed, regression test in place.
>
> **Browser QA passed**: `npm run qa:implantation -- --url http://localhost:4173`
> — 40 checks green on Lyon and Paris, including the five new ones. 6,200 unit
> tests, 0 failures.

> **2026-09-03 — the Z axis goes into service.** A follow-up to the
> `docs/CARTOGRAPHY.md` doctrine and to the representation audit of #78 (whose
> “state of application” section carried the detail, the measurements and the
> evidence). Before this pass, **a single** data layer put a datum on height
> (`bdtopo-buildings`, and it was the building's real height). There are now
> **ten**: seven by extrusion (`bdtopo-buildings`, `sitadel-fr`, `irve-fr`,
> `schools-fr`, `sup-fr`, `france-energy`, `local-datacenters`) and three by
> vertical polyline (`marine-buoys`, `earthquakes`, `anfr-fr`).
>
> **Four department/region prisms** replace four count choropleths
> (`choroplethPrism.js`: height = the absolute value on a FROZEN domain,
> color = a rate; shared envelope 4 km → 120 km, base on the ellipsoid).
> **Known trap, not yet declared in the legend**: two prism layers switched on
> together are NOT comparable — `irve-fr` and `france-energy` have the same
> `domainMax` (12,000), the same mode and the same graduations for charge
> points and for megawatts, and `irve-fr` / `schools-fr` / `sup-fr` extrude the
> same 96 polygons from the same base.
>
> **2026-09-10 — an eleventh, and it is register (4), finally named.** The
> `irve-fr` beam carries the site's charge points, as a frozen screen length
> corrected for tilt (`L · cos(tilt)`: 87% at −30°, 50% at −60°, zero at
> nadir). Its legend spells the convention out, which obligation (a) of F7
> requires and which no leader stem does yet. Its 40 km ceiling is not
> cosmetic: with the camera at 1,400 km, 64 px are worth 129 km, above the
> 120 km top of the frozen prisms.
>
> **BD TOPO buildings become a thematic support** (`buildingTheme.js`):
> `dpe-fr`, `dvf-sales` and `ads-fr` register a theme and paint the volumes, by
> precedence 10 < 20 < 30. An unjoined volume keeps its washed-out use tint —
> never the same sign as a measured value (A1).
>
> **Done at integration**, outside the agents' scope: `manager.js:2470` now
> guards with `Number.isFinite` like the on-map legend block, so an entry with
> no count (channel title, rule graduation, hatched key) no longer renders the
> literal string “undefined”; the proxy's three disk cache versions are bumped
> (IRVE 3→4, SCHOOLS 2→3, SUP 1→2) because the three rollups changed shape; and
> `ingestAisStreamEnvelope` finally captures the AIS dimension block, stored
> whole under `row.hull` rather than split again into four offsets.
> **Consequence to know**: `vesselHullFromRow()` only read `to_bow…` /
> `length`, so this wiring turned 100% of contacts into *non mesurés* (“not
> measured”) until the function accepted the three published shapes (reduced
> block first, offsets, then `length`/`beam`), re-validating the block rather
> than trusting it.
>
> **No browser QA was run on this work.** 994 unit tests over 32 files, 0
> failures; the Cesium renderings are argued from the shipped source, not seen
> on screen. It is the largest debt of this pass, and the AIS hull — whose data
> path has only just been closed — is the first thing to look at.

> **2026-09-17 — the showcase at `/`, the globe at `/globe`** (`src/boot.js` is
> the page's only entry; `src/vitrine/` owns the rest; markup `#vitrine` in
> `index.html`, styles `landing.css`).
>
> - **Two addresses, one origin.** `/` is the showcase's, `APP_PATH` (`/globe`,
>   `src/vitrine/gate.js`) is the globe's. Both are `index.html`: the SPA
>   fallback of `vite dev` and `vite preview` answers every path with it, with
>   the same `Cache-Control` and the same pre-compressed body (measured
>   2026-09-17), so there is no middleware and none is needed. One origin and
>   not a subdomain is what makes the swap invisible — `history.replaceState`
>   rewrites a path, never a host — and it keeps one `localStorage`, one cookie
>   jar, one referrer restriction on the browser Google key and one entry in
>   `GEV_PUBLIC_HOST`. `public/manifest.webmanifest` starts on `/globe`, scope
>   `/`.
> - **Which door.** `src/vitrine/gate.js`, mirrored by an inline script in the
>   head (run and compared by `gate.test.mjs` over 480 cases): `?vitrine=1|0`
>   forces; `/globe` (trailing slashes ignored) → cockpit; the QA flag
>   `window.__GEV_SKIP_VITRINE__` (set by `newQaPage` unless
>   `{ vitrine: true }`) → cockpit; a hash containing `=` → cockpit; `?q=`,
>   `?waitlist=`, `?welcome=` → cockpit; otherwise the showcase
>   (`html[data-vitrine]`). **A pure function of the address**: no storage is
>   read, and nothing is written on any arrival.
> - **There is no “already seen” memory** (`gev:vitrine-seen:v1`, #257,
>   retired by #260). It sent every later visit to `/` into the cockpit, which
>   made the home page unreachable at its own URL once a browser had opened the
>   globe. `/globe` replaced its purpose. `forgetVitrineSeen()` (called once by
>   `src/boot.js`) deletes the stale key from browsers that met #257 or #258.
> - **No engine behind the page.** `src/main.js` no longer starts itself:
>   `startCockpit(options)` does. On a wide screen the cockpit graph is
>   imported at idle (evaluated, nothing built); on a phone nothing is fetched
>   before the press. Cesium's widget stylesheet is inert on `index.html`
>   (`deferCesiumWidgets`, vite.config.js) until `boot.js` enables it.
> - **Identity and the 2 bis markup** (Codex “Belvédère”, 2026-09-19): the
>   symbol is inline SVG (`.brand-symbol`, planes in `currentColor`) before the
>   word, in `.top` and `.closing-brand`; `public/icon.svg` is the tab icon and
>   the source of `npm run icons:build` (all four PNG icons, on `#24473C`). The
>   loop is `position: fixed` behind the whole page on EVERY width; *Image
>   fixe* (Still image; `#vitrine-still`, shown only in `data-state="live"`) pauses it on
>   the current frame. The page ends on `.footer-ending`: the city with two
>   opaque blocks. The cockpit carries the same mark since 2026-09-19 (see
>   “Cockpit identity” below).
> - **The background** is a recorded loop (`public/landing/hero-*.mp4`,
>   hashed by `scripts/publish-landing-assets.mjs`), `data-state` poster → live
>   → fallback (reduced motion, Save-Data, 2G, error, 8 s). Renditions: desktop
>   2880×1800 AV1/HEVC and 1920×1200 AV1/H.264, phone 960×2078 AV1/HEVC, all
>   30 fps, recorded frame by frame (`capture-landing-hero.mjs --quality hq`).
>   `src/vitrine/renditions.js` picks the smallest definition covering the
>   box in DEVICE pixels, then smooth, then hardware (`mediaCapabilities`),
>   then AV1 > HEVC > H.264. `src/vitrine/heroLoop.js` (generated) lists them
>   with their `codecs=` strings and the camera law each loop was filmed with.
> - **The gallery moves** (PR 3, 2026-09-19): the six views and the voice
>   answer are recorded loops too (`npm run landing:gallery:capture` then
>   `landing:gallery:build`: 6 s, cockpit interface kept, fixed camera where
>   the data move, a 2–3° orbit where they do not, the Bordeaux buses ×5;
>   the sale card of view 02 and a bus card on 05 are opened through the
>   layers' `selectCard`). 480/960/1440 (600/1200 for the voice band) in AV1
>   + H.264 (1440 AV1 only), the stills are frame 0 of each loop.
>   `src/vitrine/gallery.js` — itself fetched only as the gallery nears the
>   screen — fetches a box's loop half a screen ahead, plays it on screen,
>   pauses it off screen, and obeys the hero's policy and *Image fixe* (Still image).
>   `src/vitrine/galleryLoops.js` is generated like `heroLoop.js`. The loop
>   assembly (`assembleLoop`) had repeated one frame in six (concat time base)
>   and one in three on orbits (half-frame phase); fixed, hero re-assembled.
> - **The hand-off (≥ 1 001 px).** The press moves the address to `/globe` by
>   `replaceState` — no navigation, no reload, the same document throughout
>   (`rewriteAddress`, asserted by `qa:landing` case `handoff`) — freezes the
>   loop, `html[data-vitrine="opening"]` shows `#cesiumContainer` under it,
>   `init({ handoff })` poses the camera from the law at `video.currentTime`,
>   boots on `photoreal` (the press counts as the adoption), restores the hero
>   state through a share hash that is never written (`StyleManager`
>   `initialShare`, zero-length flight), and lifts the frame once the surface
>   has drained AND the traffic layer has seated its cars (9 s deadline).
>   `window.__godsEyeView.vitrineHandoff` records it.
> - **`?q=`** is read once by `src/vitrine/query.js` and removed from the
>   address; a non-empty query replaces the boot flight with the search box's
>   own `flyToAddress`; not found → toast, text left in `#location-search`,
>   ordinary arrival. Showcase arrivals get the first-run SESSION suppression.
> - **The live figures** (*En ce moment au-dessus de la France*, “Right now
>   above France”). One `GET /api/pulse` after `load`, at idle
>   (`src/vitrine/counters.js`); the group and each entry ship `hidden` and only
>   a positive integer no older than 10 min is revealed, and taken down again
>   when it passes 10 min on screen — any failure leaves everything hidden,
>   silently.
>   The server (`pulseProxy`, vite.config.js; rules in `src/data/pulse.js`)
>   counts from caches it already holds and fetches nothing: aircraft over
>   French LAND from the OpenSky snapshot (warm only while a reader has the
>   flights layer on), vessels within the 12-mile territorial sea from the
>   AISStream map (warm whenever the key is set and the feed is live — 97.8 %
>   of 10-min windows from 2026-09-12 to 09-19), buses only when EVERY
>   network of the GTFS-RT index was heard in the window (never so far: 0.5 %
>   of windows had even one network, two at a time), weather stations from the
>   SYNOP archive (daily, 11 to 35 h old: never fresh). One counting pass a
>   minute; `why` names the reason for each null.
>
> Acceptance: `npm run qa:landing -- --url <server>` (105 checks against a
> build, 2026-09-19; the byte budget case only asserts against one). Case
> `adresses` covers the second URL, `handoff` the in-place swap, and `retour`
> the way back — open the globe for real, return to `/`, read the home page.

> **2026-09-17 — first-run card, three French variants** (`src/firstRunExperience.js`
> owns the door, `src/firstRunVariants.js` what a choice does,
> `src/firstRunHint.js` the bubble; `#first-run-launcher`, `#first-run-hint`
> and three `<template data-first-run-variant>` in `index.html`; styles at the
> tail of `style.css` and in `phone.css`). It replaces the 2026-08-23 mission
> launcher, which was upstream's card word for word: English, three tiles out of
> four leaving France (LIVE CONTACTS, SPACE MISSIONS, ENVIRONMENTAL, plus
> EXPLORE MANUALLY), a "Don't show this again" box, and a return on every fresh
> session.
>
> **Three variants, one door** (`FIRST_RUN_VARIANT_IDS = ['A', 'B', 'C']`). The
> aside is a shell — kicker `SURPLOMB · PREMIÈRE VISITE` (first visit), footer
> `Échap pour fermer` (Esc to close), a status line reading
> `59 couches de données publiques · 56 sans clé` (59 public data layers · 56
> without a key) — and the chosen template is cloned into it before the footer.
>
> - **A *Une adresse* (An address, the default).** *Qu’est-ce qui est vrai à
>   cette adresse ?* (What is true at this address?), one field, the chips
>   *Autour de moi* (Around me; revealed only when `canGeolocate()`), *Tour
>   Eiffel, Paris* and *Vieux-Port, Marseille*, and the link *Regarder autour
>   d’ici sans rien taper* (Look around here without typing). Enter calls
>   `styleManager.flyToAddress(query, { onArrival })`, and the card closes as the
>   flight STARTS. The bundle (`FIRST_RUN_ADDRESS_BUNDLE`: `dvf-sales`,
>   `ads-fr`, `dpe-fr`) is switched on exactly ONCE, at the first of
>   `arrived`, `cancelled` — the visitor chose the layers, not the landing
>   spot — or `FIRST_RUN_ARRIVAL_DEADLINE_MS` (10 s). Switching them on before
>   the flight would buy a scan of the place being left. Not found (or a failed
>   geocoder) keeps the card open, with a sticky status line and the field
>   selected. The locate chip goes through
>   `locateMe({ onArrival, notify: false })` and writes a refusal into that
>   status line rather than a toast behind the card. No autofocus on a phone:
>   the soft keyboard would cover the sheet.
> - **B *Trois questions* (Three questions).** *Par où commencer ?* (Where to
>   start?), four tiles, layers only,
>   no camera call: `sales` → `dvf-sales` + `cadastre-fr` (on a phone
>   `cadastre-fr` is skipped because it is badged LOURD (HEAVY), and the subcopy
>   becomes *Ventes DVF, 5 ans*, “DVF sales, 5 years”), `permits` → `ads-fr` + `sitadel-fr`, `live` →
>   `traffic` + `transit-fr` + `flights` (`traffic` is already on at boot;
>   asking again is idempotent), `explore` → nothing. A refused layer fails the
>   tile BY NAME and keeps the card open for a retry.
> - **C *Pas de carte* (No card).** No card: the bubble `#first-run-hint`,
>   *Première visite ? Tapez une adresse ici.* (First visit? Type an address
>   here.), anchored to the LOCATION label on a desktop and, on a phone, hung
>   UNDER the search bar at the top of the screen, caret up (since 2026-09-19;
>   it pointed at the sheet's *Recherche* (Search) tab before). Never a dialog,
>   no keydown handler — ESC and every hotkey go where they always went. It
>   closes on the first pointerdown elsewhere, after 12 s
>   (`FIRST_RUN_HINT_TIMEOUT_MS`), or when an exclusive surface takes the
>   screen; one already up means it never opens. A click inside opens the
>   search: `styleManager.openLocationSearch()` on a desktop,
>   `phoneSheet.openSearch()` on a phone (the search panel at full, the caret in
>   the bar). It is its own element because `phone.css` hides the whole sheet
>   while the launcher is visible, and the sheet is what the bubble points at.
>
> A and B drive eight distinct layers, all already in the shipped
> `set_layer_visibility` enum (unit pin). The card adds no voice tool, and the
> `GEV_REALTIME_TOOLS` sha256 pin still guards the schema.
>
> **Who picks the variant.** `initFirstRunExperience({ styleManager,
> dataManager, variant = 'A', onEvent = null, phoneSheet = null })`, and
> `src/main.js` passes `variant: 'A'`. `?welcome=a|b|c`
> (`forcedFirstRunVariant`, case-insensitive) outranks the caller and replays
> like `?welcome=1`. Assigning B and C to real visitors on the hosted instance
> is a separate change (assignment, beacon, privacy page, report); for where
> `onEvent` goes now, see “2026-09-17 — first-run A/B test” below.
>
> **The `onEvent` contract.** `{type: 'impression', shell}` (`desktop` or
> `phone`); `{type: 'action', kind, outcome, queryLength?, layerIds?}` with
> `kind` ∈ `address`, `geoloc`, `chip`, `tile:sales`, `tile:permits`,

> `found`, `not-found`, `cancelled`; `{type: 'dismiss', via}` with `via` ∈

> **Delta since the July-2 body below** (the detailed sections are still accurate
> for everything they describe; these landed after):
> - **"Never answered yet" is a THIRD state, distinct from empty (2026-08-23):**
>   `sourceState` in `src/data/militaryAwareness.js` treats a dependency that is
>   busy AND has never produced an answer (`loading === true && !lastUpdate`) as
>   unavailable, so the Contacts panel prints `?` and voice says "unknown". This
>   is deliberately NOT "busy": a source that has answered once keeps its real
>   count through every later refresh poll. It is a CONTRACT over the whole
>   dependency list rather than a fix for one layer, and the dependencies reach
>   it by different routes:
>   - **AIS vessels is its reachable producer.** `enable()`/`update()` both
>     resolve as soon as the first `/api/ais-live` poll answers, so the manager's
>     lifecycle settles to `enabled` — but until the server-side socket delivers
>     a position, `firstConnectPhase` stays `'loading'` and `getStats()` reports
>     `loading: true`, `lastUpdate: null`, count 0, and an UNDEFINED status.
>     Without the predicate that window prints an all-clear `0`.
>   - **Mapped installations never reaches that window.**
>     `militaryInstallations.enable()` is synchronous and the manager awaits
>     `update()`, which owns the first Overpass fetch, so the lifecycle stays
>     `enabling` for the whole fetch and the pre-existing `enabling` branch
>     covers it. Confirmed live on :4272 across a held 17 s first fetch (34
>     samples, `enabling` throughout, panel non-numeric) and across a failing
>     one. Its `status: 'idle'` is not what saves it — the lifecycle is; the
>     module has no `loading` status at all.
>
>   Any new dependency that can be slow must report `loading` and `lastUpdate`
>   honestly for the contract to hold, and must be pinned against the shape its

> - **A held ground snap is dropped when measured ground contradicts it
>   (2026-08-23):** the WARM hold described below answers on DISTANCE travelled,
>   which is only a proxy for whether the value still describes the ground. A
>   contact can taxi ~200 m onto a different surface INSIDE the 250 m bound, and

>   contact's CURRENT position: a measured floor more than
>   `HELD_SNAP_CONTRADICTION_M` (5 m) ABOVE the held value drops the hold and the
>   contact is COLD again, back to the floored 2D billboard. The rule is
>   ONE-SIDED on purpose — it targets BURIAL. A cell reading BELOW a real sample
>   is the floor chain's expected under-read (one-shot latch over ~111 m,
>   neighbours lean lowest, `displayFloorHeightM` only ever raises), not evidence
>   of anything, and a two-sided cut was disproved on the track rig by a planted
>   cell 66.7 m below a real sample at the same spot. Accepted residual, stated
>   with its condition: a DOWNHILL taxi floats, and the only correction on this
>   path is a SUCCESSFUL resample — nothing guarantees one. On the OSM fallback
>   `sampleHeight` misses forever, so the float persists for as long as the
>   contact stays inside the 250 m bound, with no timer beside it and no vertical
>   cap of its own beyond whatever the ground drops within that radius. It is
>   accepted because it errs UPWARD and stays visible. Three boundaries are
>   load-bearing — that one direction, MESH cells only
>   (`cachedGroundFloor`'s DEM fallback is a DIFFERENT surface; the skin/DEM
>   spread is what `MESH_FLOOR_BELOW/ABOVE_PRIOR_M` budget 15 m / 80 m for) and
>   the contact's OWN cell only (a neighbour ~111 m away may be a terminal roof —

> - **The trail's acceptance bar is visual (2026-08-23):**
>   the trail terminates roughly BACK-CENTRE on the aircraft; MINOR hull overlap
>   is acceptable; there is no conspicuous top, bottom or lateral protrusion; it
>   is stable across headings; and a parked aircraft draws no moving head
>   segment. That is the bar a future change is judged against — NOT sub-metre

>   product requirement and tightening one is not an improvement to the picture.
>   Measured on live traffic at the shipped transform, the airliner anchor sits
>   24.09 m aft (70 % of the model's rendered envelope, so inside it), 2.22 m
>   below centre (6 %), and 2e-9 m off the centreline.
> - **The tracked trail attaches to REAL HULL, aft and below (2026-08-23):**
>   `MODEL_TRAIL_ANCHOR_NATIVE` (`src/data/modelVisualAnchor.js`) holds, per GLB
>   and in RAW glTF coordinates (see the transform-chain entry below), the point
>   of the hull's CENTRELINE PROFILE (its y = 0 slice) closest to the aft-belly
>   AABB corner. It is NOT the corner: a bounding-box corner is empty
>   space, 4.80 m off the nearest triangle on `airplane.glb` and 6.14 m on
>   `jet.glb`, so the trail ended in mid air beside the aircraft. The head segment
>   is drawn from a point behind the aircraft to this anchor, so the anchor must
>   stay aft (83–96 % of each aft extreme) or the segment enters at the tail and
>   stops inside the fuselage. `modelScale.test.mjs` reads the POSITION BUFFERS —

> - **The trail anchor rides CESIUM'S transform chain, not a hand-rolled one
>   (2026-08-23 regression fix):** `MODEL_TRAIL_ANCHOR_NATIVE` stores RAW
>   glTF coordinates and `modelAnchorWorld()` assembles
>   `modelMatrix × components.transform × axisCorrection` — the same chain
>   `ModelSceneGraph` renders with, built from Cesium's own exported
>   `Axis.Y_UP_TO_Z_UP` / `Axis.Z_UP_TO_X_UP` and the model instance's own root
>   transform. The anchors were previously PRE-CONVERTED by a single glTF
>   Y-up → Z-up step (`[x,y,z]` → `[x,−z,y]`) and multiplied straight by
>   `modelMatrix`; that is half the correction (the defaults also apply
>   `Z_UP_TO_X_UP`, the complete mapping being raw `[x,y,z]` → `[z,x,y]`), and an
>   aircraft's longitudinal axis is raw glTF X, so the aft offset landed on the
>   RENDERED model's LATERAL axis. `modelMatrix` carries the heading, so both
>   frames rotated together and the trail terminated a fuselage-length to one
>   SIDE, swapping sides with the course. Measured live in each aircraft's own

> - **A grounded contact HOLDS its floor through a terrain outage (2026-08-21):**
>   when the Re:Earth proxy fails, the floor cells a grounded contact stands on
>   never warm, and the un-clamped render height for a contact reporting no
>   altitude at all is the GEOID — ~150 m below the ground at an inland field.
>   Both steps now hold instead. At POLL time `geoidSurfaceLastResortM()`
>   (`src/data/renderAltitude.js`) withholds the geoid guess from any contact
>   that already has a `renderAltitudeM`, so the sentinel path holds that height;
>   the guess is reserved for a genuine first sighting. At DISPLAY time

>   `warmGroundFloor` from the poll loop, bounded there — and 200 synchronised
>   all-cold contacts probing on the same tick measure 1.0 ms median / 1.2 ms worst on the all-cold workload (a noisier ad-hoc run of the same workload peaked at 2.1 ms), 1.4% of one 80 ms

> - **Scene playback ownership + reconcile (2026-08-20):** five corrections to
>   `src/scenes/director.js`, with the pure decisions in `src/scenes/scenePolicy.js`.
>   (1) A shot reconciles ONLY the layers it declares. The old walk forced every
>   undeclared layer off, so a recipe authored against the original four layers
>   tore down CCTV, vessels and fires with no restore pass. Operator captures
>   snapshot the whole registry, so those still reconcile in full.
>   (2) Playback claims the camera through `runImmediateNavigation('scene', …)`
>   instead of a bare `camera.flyTo`, so it releases the follow camera, respects
>   the navigation policy and lets Cockpit refuse before anything mutates.
>   (3) **Playback NEVER re-establishes tracking.** `SCENE_TRACKING_PARAM_KEYS`
>   (`selectedFlightsTrackingId`, `selectedMilitaryTrackingId`,
>   `selectedSatTrackingId`) are stripped on the way to the layer — a shot
>   captured while following a contact would otherwise hand the camera straight
>   back to the follow loop it was just taken from, recreating the two-writer
>   jitter. The keys stay in the STORED capture; only the apply path drops them.
>   A unit pin sweeps every layer's `getParams()` for the whole selection naming
>   family (`SCENE_SELECTION_PARAM_PATTERN` — `selected…`/`tracked…`, `…TrackingId`,
>   `…Mmsi`/`…Norad`/`…Icao`), and each match must be on the strip list or on
>   `SCENE_KEPT_SELECTION_PARAM_KEYS`; a name like `trackedVesselMmsi` therefore
>   cannot slip through by not matching the older spelling. CCTV's
>   `selectedCameraId` is the one recorded keep: it raises a monitor plane and
>   never writes `viewer.trackedEntity` or the camera.
>   (4) An **isolating Context mode is exited before a shot's layers apply**.
>   Space Missions refuses every enable outside its replay bundle, so with it
>   left dirty all five recipes were refused (or, for Orbital Watch, composed
>   over a replay they never declared). The verdict is read off the shared guard
>   (`contextLayerEnableBlockReason`), not a mode name, so a future isolating
>   mode is covered — the probe id `SCENE_EXCLUSIVITY_PROBE_LAYER_ID` is
>   reserved by a test against the real layer registry. The exit itself is the
>   ordinary `setContextMode('off')` exact-restore path and is deliberately NOT
>   abortable: leaving the mode IS the restore to the operator's pre-mode state,
>   and tearing that transaction in half would strand Context. A refused
>   `setEnabled` is surfaced in the status line and a `shot_layers_refused`
>   telemetry event instead of being reported as success. **Mixed accepted /
>   refused layers are reported honestly, not rolled back** — a shot whose
>   enables partly failed leaves the layers that did move in place.
>   (5) **Cancellation cancels the work, not just the next step.** Checking a
>   flag after an `await` only stops what has not started, so both awaited
>   operations are now themselves cancellable. Layers: the run/LOAD owns an
>   `AbortController` whose signal is passed to every `setEnabled`, and STOP,
>   supersession, and run teardown abort it — the data manager rolls an aborted
>   enable back through the module's own `disable()`, so no layer is left on
>   carrying stale params. Visuals: `styleManager.applyVisualState(state, {
>   isCurrent })` gates BOTH halves of the map-stack switch, which is its only
>   suspension point. The switch is a *mutation*, not just a wait, and
>   `mapStackController` invalidates a switch only when another `setStack()`
>   arrives — a winning state that omits `mapStack` (every normalized shot does)
>   never issues one, so a stale switch would otherwise stand on the globe.
>   So: an already-superseded caller never starts the switch, and one superseded
>   *during* it puts the globe back to the stack the winner inherited — but only
>   while `getSwitchGeneration()` shows no newer switch has claimed it, because
>   a newer switch is a live intent that must not be stomped. The shader-uniform
>   commit after the await keeps its own gate. Precisely: a stale LOAD's
>   *synchronous* prelude (style/sharpen/HUD) can still have landed before it was
>   superseded, and is then overwritten by the newer state; what cannot survive
>   is its map stack, its uniform commit, its layers, or its camera flight.
>   Post-`await` flag checks remain as a backstop. Known remainder: run cleanup
>   still waits on a suspended
>   visual/map operation, because `setRecordingMode(false)` is not idempotent
>   (a second call restores HUD `auto` rather than the operator's saved mode) —
>   worst case is recording chrome staying up until the promise settles, which
>   then restores correctly.
> - **Ambient contact labels (2026-08-20):** detection callsign callouts paint
>   on the shared normal-blend world-overlay canvas as their own host lane
>   (`detection-callouts`) — NOT on the screen-blended sensor surface. `screen`
>   can only lighten, so a dark backing plate drawn there is a no-op over sunlit
>   ground and the text dissolves into the imagery. Brackets, the scanline wash
>   and the mode banner stay on the sensor surface; the callout lane registers
>   in the same `detection` slot, so callouts keep their z-position beneath every
>   ordinary overlay card and beneath the tracked readout. Plate fills come from
>   per-theme `calloutPlate` / `calloutPlateSpace` tokens (~63% / ~73% of the
>   tracked card's `CARD_PLATE_ALPHA`), resolved once per style change; space-tier
>   contacts take the heavier one. Rows are pooled, and an empty field must clear
>   the replay buffer or the final callsigns strand on the canvas. **Do not move
>   callouts back onto the sensor surface, and do not merge the plate tokens into
>   `labelBg`** — that token is the scanline wash and shifting it retunes the
>   sensor texture. Plates are additionally **backdrop-selective (2026-08-21)**:
>   `skyBackdropFactor()` (`src/data/iconOrientation.js`, exact scaled-space
>   ellipsoid silhouette) feathers the plate FILL ALPHA to `SKY_PLATE_SCALE`
>   (0.18×) for labels above the horizon — sky backdrops read as near-bare text,
>   terrain backdrops keep the full plate — across a smoothstep band of
>   `HORIZON_FEATHER_RAD` (~1.09°/side). Only the plate alpha feathers; text,
>   tier accents, leaders, brackets, and the tracked readout card are untouched.
>   **The test is TWO-REGIME, and only the first regime is a ray test
>   (2026-08-22).** Above the ellipsoid, `1` means the view ray genuinely misses
>   the planet and the function is the exact complement of the occluder. **At and
>   below the ellipsoid the horizon is EYE LEVEL** — the local geodetic
>   horizontal plane through the camera — and that is NOT a ray-miss test: from a
>   −18 m camera the ray to a contact 900 m up crosses the ellipsoid and still
>   reads sky, deliberately, because the ellipsoid it crosses is not a surface
>   anyone can see. It is reached by clamping the tangent cone's half-angle at
>   90°, the continuous limit of the same formula (the horizon dip goes to zero
>   at the surface), and is the convention Cesium's `EllipsoidalOccluder` already
>   uses there, so the two stay sign-consistent. This is not an edge case:
>   coastal airports sit at NEGATIVE ellipsoid height (JFK ramp ≈ −30 m, geoid
>   ≈ −34 m), so a ground-level cockpit is genuinely inside the ellipsoid and
>   **must not** be treated as degenerate — doing so put a full plate behind
>   every label on an empty sky. Fail-closed now covers only unanswerable input
>   (null, zero-length ray, non-finite camera, camera at the planet's centre).
>   Note the pairing: from such a camera the occluder culls every contact BELOW
>   eye level before detection sees it, so ground-backed labels only reappear
>   once the camera clears the ellipsoid. Rendered proof:
>   `scripts/qa-cockpit-plates.mjs`.
> - **Required attribution has two named keep-out rules (2026-08-20):** the
>   Google/Cesium credit line must stay visible in every state, and below 900px
>   two surfaces used to paint over it — the command dock's popover tray (any
>   width ≤900px) and the right context rail, which goes edge-to-edge below
>   720px and covered the credit with every dock panel closed. Both now yield;
>   the credit itself never moves, shrinks, or hides. **The clearance is not a
>   single constant:** `#command-dock` is anchored at `2vh` down to 721px and
>   re-anchors to a flat `8px` at 720px while `#cesium-credits` keeps its `2vh`
>   base, so anything reasoning "the 2vh terms cancel" is only true in the
>   721–900px band. `src/creditAttribution.test.mjs` is a **fail-closed** cascade
>   model: it flattens `style.css`, resolves each anchor by importance →
>   specificity → source order, evaluates a 14×11 viewport grid, and fails
>   loudly on any construct it cannot resolve (`!important`, `inset`/`margin`
>   shorthands, unvetted custom properties, unparsable or nested media queries,
>   or an unrecognized selector positioning one of these elements). Extend the
>   model rather than working around it — a silent skip here ships a ToS
>   violation.
> - **Dock tray stacking is decided by ID count (2026-08-20):** the pinned-tray
>   selectors `#command-dock.dock-has-two-pinned-trays …` carry one ID against
>   five classes, so any narrow-width override written with two IDs outranks
>   them and the upper tray silently loses `var(--dock-lower-pinned-height)`,
>   landing on its pinned sibling. The ≤900px and ≤720px overrides therefore
>   name the panel (`#location-bar` / `#control-panel`) to reach (2,5,0). Adding
>   a new tray rule means checking it against the pinned variants, not just
>   against the base rule.
> - **LOCATION mini-status is data-only today (2026-08-20):** the collapsed
>   readout now follows a free-text geocode search as well as preset pills
>   (`src/locationStatus.js` owns the copy for both), and every other camera
>   destination invalidates the searched label — `_stampNavigation` covers
>   voice/reset/takeover/selection, and scene playback calls the public
>   `clearSearchedLocation()` per shot. `#command-dock` still hides
>   `.location-mini-status` with `display: none !important`, so none of this is
>   on screen; a `display:none` subtree is also out of the accessibility tree,
>   so nothing is announced. Unhiding it is a separate product decision.
> - **The Street Traffic sync chip shows one percentage (2026-08-20):** the
>   settled confirmation flash carries the layer's coverage figure and NO
>   progress number. `reduceTrafficSyncFeedback` returns an empty
>   `progressText` once the sync lands and `#traffic-sync-progress:empty`
>   collapses the slot; the renderer writes the empty value rather than
>   guarding on truthiness, or the busy `...` strands beside the settled label.
> - **`#active-style-name` has exactly one writer (2026-08-20):** the style-name
>   mapping in `setStyle`. Location, search, and scene paths report where the
>   camera is through the LOCATION surfaces, never the style slot.
> - **Share-link selected-subject Follow (2026-08-20):** a copied v2 link adds
>   an ephemeral `at` epoch-seconds field; ordinary live hash updates omit it.
>   A shared Flights, Military Flights, or Satellites selection restores only
>   after the base destination camera, ordinary layer restoration, and a new
>   destination-scoped source refresh settle. The source module—not lifecycle
>   success or the UI—owns the final presence decision: Flights and Military
>   use the exact accepted snapshot, while Satellites waits for the applicable
>   dense catalog and treats a partial CelesTrak catalog as unable to prove
>   absence. A found subject starts the normal moving Follow at its current
>   position regardless of link age. An authoritatively missing subject is
>   `expired` only when copy age is strictly greater than 90 seconds for Flights,
>   45 seconds for Military, or 5 minutes for Satellites; equality, missing or
>   malformed time, and other non-found cases are unavailable. Feed/catalog
>   failure has its own feed-unavailable message. These warnings use the
>   universal top-center status banner and its standard failure dwell, beginning
>   only after the shared-view startup cover clears. If
>   teardown or disable invalidates an in-flight refresh, any selected-subject
>   restore waiting behind it settles as cancelled instead of remaining pending.
>   Terminal non-found cleanup compare-clears only the exact passive ID in memory and the live URL, never
>   recipient local storage. A newer explicit selection, visibility request,
>   destination, pointer gesture, wheel gesture, destroy, or source cancellation
>   wins and suppresses late Follow/status work without cancelling unrelated
>   shared layer visibility or options. Radio station selection remains outside
>   the share payload; Radio restores only its allowlisted filter and volume.
> - **AIS feed watchdog (2026-08-18):** feed liveness is judged by DATA, not
>   socket state — AISStream can complete the handshake and then deliver
>   nothing forever. `/api/ais-live` reports `live | stale | reconnecting |
>   down | auth-failed` (plus the unchanged `missing-key`/`unsupported`) with
>   `silentForMs`, `reconnectAttempt` and `nextAttemptAt`. Silence is REPORTED
>   at 120s and ACTED ON at 300s; recovery walks a 5s/15s/60s/300s ladder and
>   then stops at a terminal `down` with a slow 15-min retry running behind it
>   (a retry never flips the chip back to "connecting" — only real data clears
>   `down`). Liveness credit requires a frame that arrived on a still-owned
>   socket AND decoded into a real AIS record: handshakes, malformed frames and
>   error envelopes are never liveness, and orphan frames are dropped entirely.
>   Failures are CLASSIFIED — auth rejections (error envelope, HTTP 401/403)
>   are terminal with an hourly probe and an actionable chip, 429 honours
>   `Retry-After` and otherwise enters at the slowest rung, and only genuine
>   transport faults use the ladder; worst case is single-digit connection
>   attempts per hour in every class. Degraded states stay visible in the chip
>   even while cached vessels are still drawn.
>   **Locked invariants — do not "fix" these:** teardown is `ws.terminate()`,
>   never `close()` (the built-in WebSocket has no hard-abort and its `close()`
>   never completes against a black-holed peer, leaking the single per-key
>   connection); socket generations are monotonic for the module lifetime and
>   never reused across a dispose, and every socket-map mutation is
>   identity-checked (otherwise a pre-disposal close event orphans a
>   post-disposal socket and two connections race for the one slot); durations
>   use a monotonic clock, wall time only for display. Policy is a pure state
>   machine (`src/data/aisWatchdog.js`) returning actions; the socket lifecycle

>   transport assumption is pinned in `src/data/aisWatchdogTransport.test.mjs`.
> - **Honest live AIS health:** the vessel layer treats socket connection,
>   first message receipt, raw payload rows, and accepted vessel positions as
>   separate stages. Each enabled session owns one 30-second first-connect
>   grace: an open or connecting socket with no accepted position reads
>   `LOADING`, and polls do not restart that deadline. The first accepted
>   position ends the grace and establishes freshness; expiry, missing
>   credentials, rejected transport, or another definitive failure reads
>   `UNAVAILABLE`. Disable/re-enable starts a new isolated session. A socket

>   `lastUpdate` or replace warm accepted vessels;
>   warm selection and trail state remain visible as stale/degraded. Late
>   responses from disabled, destroyed, or replaced layer requests cannot

>   status, message time, and raw/accepted row counts for diagnosis.
> - **Vessel/fire camera transfer:** clicking an actionable AIS vessel sprite
>   or painted card selects that MMSI and requests one close oblique camera
>   transfer; re-clicking the selected vessel refocuses it. FIRMS detection
>   sprites and actionable detection cards do the same using a refetch-stable

>   Aggregate fire cells remain non-actionable. Painted actionable cards are
>   also mirrored into a named, focusable assistive-control list that exposes
>   selected state and announces focus only after the backing record accepts
>   activation. Global FIRMS cards reject far-side cells before
>   filling the bounded overlay cohort; the shared overlay still owns final
>   horizon culling. The UI validates world-focus
>   requests before releasing tracking, refuses Cockpit-owned moves before any
>   camera mutation, and releases follow owners before accepted flights.
>   Sibling-owned picks win without clearing the vessel/fire selection or

> - **Loading, reset, and Display completion:** every registered layer exposes
>   one normalized manager loading contract. Enable and disable feedback remains
>   lifecycle-authoritative, while manager-owned periodic updates publish
>   refreshing, failure, and recovery without replacing a producer's more
>   specific error or availability state. The shared presentation is delayed to
>   avoid flashes, visible outside the rails, and retained in
>   Cockpit. One continuous overlapping load interval retains the strongest
>   terminal outcome (`failed`, then `cancelled`, then `complete`) until every
>   participant settles, so a later success cannot mask an earlier failure.
>   A participating producer's terminal error, unavailable status, or
>   key-required state also outranks generic completion without requiring a
>   separate manager failure event; AIS first-connect expiry therefore ends as
>   `LOAD FAILED`, not `LOAD COMPLETE`.
>   Slow disable work is labeled as turning live data off rather than
>   as a completed load. Street Traffic's dedicated sync chip shows genuine
>   work and one bounded completion; steady TomTom coverage, including 0%, does
>   not keep it open. Mapped Installations reports its bounded camera-driven
>   requests to the same shared surface, but full-globe `zoom-in` guidance is
>   not presented as loading. Terminal completion, cancellation, and failure
>   labels are centered in that surface without an empty detail slot. The circular `RESET GLOBE` action sits beside the top-center share
>   control in map view; Cockpit hides the complete action group and provides a
>   cockpit-styled `RESET` beside `EXIT COCKPIT`. Both resets share one route
>   with the voice action, release continuous/POI/Cockpit/entity and
>   Space Mission camera ownership, and returns to the 18,000 km globe frame.
>   Reset preserves the selected Contact while invalidating delayed automatic
>   refocus work; the normal Context `FOCUS` action is the explicit route back
>   to that same flight or vessel after the globe view settles. Location
>   navigation uses the same selection-preserving camera
>   handoff once a city, landmark, coordinates, or search destination resolves;
>   failed searches leave the current camera owner untouched, and Context Focus
>   can return to the preserved Contact. Focus also restores the selected
>   aircraft's canonical follow frame after a manual zoom-away.
>   Visual presets retain the order Normal, CRT, NVG, FLIR, Anime, Noir, Snow.
>   Configurable preset selection—including same-style reselection—opens the
>   shared Parameters surface directly below Detection and scrolls it into
>   view; share-link restoration
>   does not force that disclosure. Presets remain in the map Display. The
>   shared Parameters surface moves into Cockpit Display for the session and
>   returns on exit, with slider values contained by the panel at its supported widths;
>   the bottom Visual Presets tray owns the MAP SOURCE label, centered status,
>   and four-tile source row. Its compact wing is a keyboard disclosure:
>   Enter/Space opens and focuses Map Source, Escape closes and returns focus,
>   and unavailable sources remain tabbable with their reason exposed. Expanded left-panel
>   headers use the same container-owned background treatment without changing
>   their collapsed launchers; a soft 28% cyan divider identifies expanded
>   titles on both side rails.
>   Cockpit portals HUD, Detection, the single shared Parameters surface, and
>   3D controls, but not the visual-preset grid. Parameters follow the active
>   Cockpit vision treatment and remain directly below Detection. Changing the
>   top vision style does not close an open Display or Radio utility; explicitly
>   opening Display still collapses Live Signals. Its left-side
>   Data Layers and Contact interactions do not collapse an expanded
>   Display or Radio utility. Presentation-only adaptive collapse is reconsidered after HUD
>   and viewport changes, while explicit collapse remains the only persisted
>   user intent.
>   Display orders 3D immediately above Celestial and Clean UI immediately
>   below it. The top-center action group places Clear Layers to the left of
>   Share and Reset Globe to the right. Clear Layers turns off the currently
>   selected manager-owned data layers, including an active Context choice,
>   while retaining visual, HUD, map, and panel settings. A disabled layer may
>   still release camera work that it owns through its normal teardown.
>   Direct Data Layers entry into Space Missions excludes the new mission ON
>   intent from its pre-entry snapshot. Its OFF control therefore leaves Space
>   Missions off and restores Satellites to their exact pre-entry visibility
>   and parameter state.
>   **Cockpit identity (Belvédère, 2026-09-19):** the title bar and the boot
>   screen carry the home page's mark — the inline symbol (two ivory planes,
>   apricot sun) and “surplomb” in Manrope 800 — with *Aucun angle mort.* (No
>   blind spots.)
>   under the word. The old eye (`public/logo.svg`, `src/logoGaze.js`) is
>   removed. Chrome palette: night-green glass (`--glass-bg`), ivory type,
>   apricot accent (`--accent`), DM Sans for prose (`--font-sans`); JetBrains
>   Mono stays the DATA face (readouts, canvas cards), because the canvas
>   layout arithmetic is exact only in a monospace.
>   **The boot veil's sun** (`src/loaderSun.js`, started by `src/boot.js`
>   beside the cockpit import, never on the showcase): the veil is brand green;
>   the sun runs a 6 s arc over the terrace, the terrace's shadow falls on the
>   ground (a clipped `<use>`), and the pointer steers it. `#loading-screen
>   .hidden` lands it back in the mark in 600 ms, inside the veil's 800 ms fade,

> - **Context, Cockpit, and Radio interaction contract:** explicit Contacts,
>   Space Missions, and successful Cockpit actions reveal the Context panel, while
>   restoration and replay preserve its prior collapsed state. Contacts uses the
>   dedicated right-side chooser; the underlying Global Context coordinator is
>   registered for lifecycle and restoration but is not duplicated in Data Layers.
>   Inside Cockpit, the focused summary card is titled Contact in both visible
>   copy and its accessible control labels.
>   The top-center Cockpit vision cycle shows the inherited map preset name
>   (for example, `NOIR`) followed by CRT, NVG, FLIR, and NOIR. That inherited entry
>   leaves the selected map preset unchanged inside Cockpit. NONE is not offered
>   in the cycle; CRT, NVG, FLIR, and NOIR temporarily override that preset, while returning to it or exiting
>   Cockpit restores the captured map style and its exact shader intensities.
>   Selecting a Cockpit vision treatment with configurable parameters opens
>   Cockpit Display and reveals those parameters through the existing right-side
>   accordion; an inherited parameterless Normal preset does not force it open.
>   Expanded Cockpit Display uses a container-integrated header and soft 28% cyan divider
>   matching the expanded left-side panel treatment; its collapsed launcher
>   keeps the standalone glass surface and muted divider. Cockpit Display and
>   Radio use right-rail chevrons: left to expand and right to collapse.
>   Cockpit side surfaces use one expanded body per side: Display or Radio
>   collapses Live Signals and vice versa. When both utilities close, Live
>   Signals reopens unless the user explicitly collapsed it. Expansion notifications
>   fire only on a real collapsed-to-expanded transition, preventing repeated close
>   synchronization from re-entering the disclosure coordinator. Data Layers collapses
>   Contact, while expanding Contact returns that panel to its visible
>   launchers. Live viewport-height changes remeasure both utility lanes and
>   keep their collapsed launchers inside the obstacle-free corridor above
>   Contact and Live Signals. An expanded Data Layers panel is solved against the
>   viewport rather than the Cockpit cards: the CONTACT card and the peripheral
>   Intel HUD corners stop shortening its corridor while it is open, so it
>   unfurls downward from its collapsed launcher position and renders over them
>   (`#left-panel-stack` is z-index 147, above the Intel HUD readouts at 146 and
>   the Cockpit HUD at 145), scrolling internally when the layer list is longer than
>   the corridor. Cesium's credit line is never passable and still bounds the
>   corridor. Layer toggles stay live from there, and collapsing returns the
>   plain launcher. The map-only Clear, Share, and Reset Globe actions are hidden
>   for the duration of Cockpit, both as a group and as individual controls.
>   It uses the `radar` symbol and provides roving keyboard tab navigation. Its action row
>   places the single Cockpit entry before Search Nearby Sites. Cockpit removes
>   the duplicate floating map entry and topline exit; the bottom-center
>   `EXIT COCKPIT` control (offset downward by a `-95px` bottom margin) plus `Escape`/`C` own exit, with entry/exit focus
>   transfer and failure-safe shortcut routing. The exit control sits at the
>   bottom-center compass position. A Cockpit-only control strip sits
>   directly above Live Signals, anchored 12px under the REC readout it shares
>   the right margin with and clamped to keep 8px above the briefing card,
>   never rising past `max(96px, 12vh)`; Cockpit owns that anchor and
>   republishes it every layout tick (the left accordion no longer donates its
>   corridor). Its minimal Display popover exposes Intel HUD,
>   Detection, Parameters, and 3D aircraft. During Cockpit, those existing
>   standard Display controls move into the Cockpit popover and retain their normal
>   nested interaction: HUD plus Tactical/Operator/Minimal layout, Detection plus
>   Density/Allocation/Fade/Outside tuning, and 3D plus Proximity/All mode. The
>   same nodes and state return to the map Display on exit, so Cockpit does not
>   maintain a second control state. **Detection is owned by the CONTACTS
>   session, not by Cockpit** (validated 2026-08-18): activating Contacts
>   forces detection on at the shared military preset (`MILITARY_DETECTION_PRESET`
>   — Dense @ 75%, the same frozen object the CRT/NVG/FLIR styles apply), and it
>   then stays on for the whole session — cockpit enter, cockpit exit and
>   third-person tracking are moves WITHIN Contacts and do not touch detection at
>   all. A manual DETECT change during the session holds for the rest of it.
>   Deactivating Contacts restores the pre-Contacts state, except that a map
>   style chosen during the session keeps its own auto-enable preset (that rule
>   is younger than the entry snapshot). The trigger lives on
>   `_syncContactsDetection()`, called from `_syncContextModeButtons()` and gated
>   on `!_contextModeChanging` so it fires at transaction settle, never at click
>   — a failed activation cannot strand detection on. Policy in
>   `src/contactsDetectionPolicy.js`. Detection continues to show surrounding
>   aircraft in Cockpit while omitting only the active first-person subject's bracket;
>   handoffs move that suppression to the new subject and exit restores the
>   selected aircraft's map-view bracket. Remaining Cockpit bracket strokes render
>   at 45% of their normal presentation opacity to reduce visor clutter; callouts,
>   density, allocation, fade, and Outside tuning are unchanged and normal bracket
>   opacity returns on exit. AIR presentation follows the same retained 3D mode:
>   Proximity uses 150/185 km and All uses 400/450 km. With 3D off, in-range
>   contacts remain rotating 2D silhouettes; with 3D on, ready admitted models
>   take over under the Cockpit cap of 60. Loading/capped contacts remain 2D,
>   out-of-range contacts use rotation-free dots, and exit restores map treatment.
>   Its Radio popover exposes compact power,
>   transport, station, and volume controls. Cockpit Previous/Next preserves
>   selection, autoplay, and broadcaster fallback audio without starting the
>   map-view station flights that compete with the first-person camera. These
>   are a Cockpit-only accordion:
>   each static header uses the left accordion's label and divider with a dedicated
>   directional-chevron disclosure button and no full-row hover treatment. Only one
>   utility body expands at a time. On desktop, its collapsed sibling remains
>   visible whenever both controls fit above Live Signals; a constrained
>   corridor gives the expanded utility the full height and temporarily hides
>   that sibling, restoring it as soon as room returns. Collapsed Display
>   matches the collapsed Data Layers launcher width. Expanded Display uses the
>   standard map Display panel's 272 px width, glass shell, header surface, and
>   internal spacing. Radio retains its independent compact and expanded widths.
>   Display no longer follows the Data Layers corridor: that corridor is solved
>   against left-lane obstacles and has nothing to say about the right margin,
>   which dropped the strip into Live Signals below roughly 830 px of browser
>   height. Cockpit owns the strip's anchor and republishes it on every layout
>   tick — including the settling pass after HUD transitions and asynchronous
>   map-provider swaps — hanging it 12 px under the REC readout, clamping it up
>   to keep 8 px above Live Signals, and never letting it rise past
>   `max(96 px, 12vh)`. The utility height is measured from that resolved top
>   and floors on a launcher height rather than a fixed minimum, so expansion is
>   bounded to the real corridor below the Cockpit topline and above Live
>   Signals, including when a tall panel takes over the corridor. A hidden
>   sibling is also removed from the accessibility tree, and focus transfers to
>   the expanded utility if a layout transition hides the focused launcher. The
>   shared map Display, Radio detail,
>   ordinary Global Context, and Scenes surfaces stay hidden in Cockpit. Data
>   Layers remains available. Its Cockpit-only stack paints
>   above the curved speed and altitude rulers, matching the existing Context,
>   Signals, Display, and Radio surface ordering without changing map-view
>   stacking. Narrow mobile Cockpit
>   viewports suppress the legacy layer stack, peripheral HUD, and secondary
>   Context/briefing panes so the flight instruments and primary controls remain
>   unobstructed. Outside Cockpit, Radio starts collapsed while off. When Context
>   is collapsed, its Radio header icon opens compact controls whose explicit
>   Enable/Disable action owns power; stable close and full-panel buttons own
>   compact dismissal and one-way detailed expansion independently. When Context
>   is already expanded, that same icon skips the floating compact card, expands
>   the embedded Radio section, scrolls it into view, and moves keyboard focus to
>   its disclosure control. The detailed panel's normal accordion control owns
>   its collapse. Compact/detailed state and playback continuity remain shared.
>   Radio volume in the full, compact, and Cockpit surfaces, plus Space Mission
>   replay speed, use Display / Sharpen's muted 3px rail, circular cyan thumb,
>   glow, and mono value treatment. Their larger transparent hit areas, keyboard
>   focus indication, ranges, disabled states, and mission speed scale remain
>   control-specific.
>   Outside Cockpit, panel collapse state is independent. Multiple expanded
>   panels in either desktop lane share the measured viewport-safe corridor.
>   If a later panel would receive less than half its intrinsic height, the
>   layout presents it as a collapsed, accessible launcher without overwriting
>   the user's saved preference; the panel most recently opened by the user
>   keeps the lane, so an older expanded sibling yields when necessary. In a
>   constrained Tactical lane, later competing panels collapse to their
>   launchers even when they would narrowly exceed that threshold. While the
>   left lane remains constrained, every collapsed sibling launcher is hidden
>   and the primary panel uses the complete safe corridor; the launchers return
>   when that panel closes or the stack fits again. An expanded
>   Tactical Display claims the right lane and hides every collapsed CCTV and
>   Context sibling, including a layout-collapsed Context; those launchers
>   return when Display releases the lane. Display itself remains the single
>   scroll surface when a visual preset adds Parameters: those rows do not form
>   a nested scroll surface. The bottom Visual Presets MAP SOURCE row keeps the
>   `3D` status and four source tiles inside its padded tray; the row wraps
>   from one row to two at 620 px, and live viewport changes keep the complete
>   tray inside the screen.
>   Adaptive remeasurement preserves the user's
>   scroll position across Tactical, Minimal, and HUD Off layouts.
>   During an active Scene run, Clear Selected Layers and Reset Globe remain
>   hidden until playback stops or completes because the Scene transport owns
>   layer and camera sequencing for that interval.
>   The Cockpit Contact summary exposes Previous and Next contact navigation
>   plus its collapse control; it does not offer a Focus action because the
>   first-person Cockpit camera remains owned by the tracked aircraft.
>   A voice Cockpit request that retargets to a filtered civilian or military
>   contact carries voice selection authority through navigation, so the
>   aircraft entered is also the durable target used by Copy Link and reload.
>   Missing context values render as `—` with an accessible “Unavailable” name.
>   Because the panel hosts its own Previous/Next controls, the ONLY condition
>   that hides it is the absence of a context snapshot. Contact identity never
>   gates visibility — hiding on a non-aircraft subject stranded the operator
>   the moment Next landed on a vessel or an installation.
> - **Contact readout: foreign subjects and CONTACT LOST.** When the selected
>   contact is not the tracked aircraft (a vessel, an installation, another
>   aircraft), the panel stays up and keeps its label, cohort counts, nearest
>   contact, distance and evaluated time live. Only the nose-relative direction
>   arrow and BRG readout are dashed: those two are measured in the tracked
>   aircraft's own frame while the rest of that row is measured from the
>   selected contact, and rendering both live presents one mixed-frame reading
>   as a single measurement.
>   A contact that leaves its feed holds the panel in a `CONTACT LOST` state
>   (`data-state="lost"`, the same panel-level cue mechanism as `uncertain`,
>   in the amber the app already spends on unknown/stale inputs): the last
>   rendered values stay on screen rather than being recomputed against a
>   position that stopped updating, and Previous/Next stay operable so the
>   operator can step off. It fires on two paths, and both retain the snapshot:
>   an eviction-origin selection clear (`reason: 'evicted'` — the aged-out
>   branches in `flights.js` / `militaryFlights.js`, AIS pin exhaustion, and a
>   viewport refresh that drops a selected record), and a refresh whose
>   presence check comes back absent. A DELIBERATE clear (click-away, Escape,
>   voice stop, layer disable) still clears the subject and takes the panel
>   down; an untagged clear defaults to deliberate.
> - **Presence contract (`hasContact`).** `flights`, `militaryFlights` and
>   `aisLiveVessels` each expose `hasContact(id)`: `true`/`false` in O(1) from
>   the layer's own keyed map, or `null` when the layer holds no data and
>   therefore cannot answer (disabled, or not yet loaded). Presence consumers
>   MUST use it and must never infer absence from `getAllPositions`, which
>   stops at its cap — the live flights layer routinely carries ~11k contacts
>   against a 1,000-row cap, so "not in the returned rows" is not "gone".
>   `null` leaves the previous verdict untouched, so a silent layer can never
>   fabricate a CONTACT LOST cue.
> - **Compact data-attribution panel:** the complete Cesium credit inventory
>   remains available without taking over the viewport. Its expanded desktop
>   panel is capped at 70dvh/36rem, the wrapped 12px credit list scrolls inside
>   it, and narrow screens retain Cesium's full-screen surface with an internal
>   scroller. The title, close control, links, and persistent Google/Cesium line
>   remain unchanged and visible.
> - **Distant-aircraft recession:** both civilian and military billboard fleets
>   retain their locked class/ground scale and `NearFarScalar`, then multiply a
>   limb-relative taper in the existing ~12 Hz tick. The taper is 1 below 0.5×
>   geometric limb distance and smoothsteps to 0.45 scale plus a 0.35 alpha-haze
>   factor at the limb. That treatment eases continuously back to identity from
>   3,500–4,500 km camera height, avoiding a globe-view threshold pop. These
>   values, the start ratio, blend band, composed floor, and write epsilon remain
>   runtime tunings. No aircraft is count-culled or made fully transparent.
>   Focus emphasis and limb haze multiply at one deadband-gated write site, and
>   their product is clamped to 0.20 before freshness alpha is applied. Ambient
>   fleet models receive that same composed alpha; class/ground/cockpit repaints
>   preserve the current limb scale instead of dropping it for a tick.
> - **Focus-aware contact de-emphasis:** civilian/military aircraft and
>   satellites publish the selected target's padded screen bounds and camera
>   distance from the same per-frame position cache already consumed by their
>   tracked entity. Ambient flight sprites, AIS chevrons, CCTV icons, and
>   satellite points then ease their own alpha where they compete with that
>   target; no draw-order assumption participates. The always-visible rule is
>   narrowly amended rather than removed: emphasis never falls below 0.25,
>   contacts never blink or disappear, entry/exit use 6 px hysteresis, and
>   writes use a 0.005 alpha deadband. Defaults are 18 px padding, 300 ms attack,
>   600 ms release, an 8%-of-target-distance range hysteresis band, and
>   `nearerBehavior: 'allow'`; `dim` and `partial` remain runtime/evidence
>   tunings. Ambient overlap includes each sprite's own rendered extent. The
>   gated AIS, CCTV, and satellite passes retain an active-emphasis count so a
>   settled dim contact always completes its release after tracking ends.
> - **Terrain-height resilience:** `/api/terrain/heights` caches canonical
>   5-decimal points individually, reconstructs reordered/overlapping batches
>   in exact request order, and refreshes only missing or stale points. Network,
>   429, and 5xx failures receive bounded jittered retries with `Retry-After`;
>   stale real heights remain usable per point, while an uncached absent height
>   still returns 502 rather than becoming a fabricated ground value. Client
>   geoid fallbacks wait 60 seconds before retrying and self-heal to Re:Earth on
>   the first later successful fetch.
> - **Provider Settings (POWER UP):** a dev-server-only surface that writes API
>   keys into this checkout's `.env` (or, under Pinokio, `pinokio/ENVIRONMENT`).
>   `GET /api/setup/status` returns presence and source class per registry
>   entry, never a value or a suffix; `POST /api/setup/keys` validates, upserts,
>   sets `process.env` live, and restarts the dev server so the client-exposed
>   defines re-inject. The registry — which keys exist, what they unlock, which
>   env vars they need — lives once in `src/keySetupCore.mjs` and is read by the
>   panel, the endpoints, `npm run doctor`, and `pinokio/_ENVIRONMENT`; tests
>   fail if any of them drifts from it.
>
>   The endpoints install via `configureServer` only and are excluded from the
>   preview-parity map, so they do not exist under `vite preview` — which is
>   what a deployment runs. The client removes both the chip and the dialog from
>   the DOM when the status fetch does not return a payload, so a built bundle
>   carries no credential surface at all rather than a refused one.
>
>   `admitKeySetupRequest` refuses, in order: any request carrying a
>   reverse-proxy or CDN header (`forwarded`, `x-forwarded-*`, `cf-connecting-ip`,
>   …), any launch with Pinokio sharing enabled, a non-loopback socket, a
>   non-local `Host`, a POST with no Origin or a cross Origin, and a POST that
>   is not `application/json`. A credential that reached the process from
>   outside this panel's store — an exported shell variable, the macOS Keychain,
>   another launcher — is reported `managed: 'external'`, rendered read-only,
>   and refused (409) for both replacement and removal; `dev-fresh.sh` passes a
>   names-only provenance marker (`GEV_KEY_SETUP_EXTERNAL_KEYS`) so that holds
>   even when the external value and the stored one are byte-identical. Writes
>   go to a fresh same-directory temp file created `0600`, hardened before any
>   secret is written, fsynced, then renamed over the target.
>
>   Framing: every document this dev server serves carries `X-Frame-Options:
>   DENY` and `frame-ancestors 'none'` EXCEPT `fiche.html`, which is meant to be
>   embedded. Re-navigating an embedded fiche to `/` does not defeat that — the
>   guard is evaluated per navigation, against the response of the document
>   actually being loaded.
>
> - **Overpass cache admission:** `/api/overpass` parses and sanitizes requests,
>   then checks fresh memory, identical in-flight work, and fresh disk entries
>   before invoking its local 90/min limiter. Cache and single-flight responses
>   therefore do not spend quota; upstream-bound misses retain the existing
>   limiter, mirror, stale, and sanitization behavior. One predicate,
>   `overpassPayloadIsData`, governs all three payload decisions — what may be
>   written to the cache, what may be READ back from memory or disk, and what
>   may be replaced by a stale entry — so a refusal can neither be admitted as
>   data nor block its own replacement. Every degraded path, including a caller
>   that JOINED an in-flight request whose outcome was a refusal, serves
>   last-good data through the same reader; a coalesced caller and the caller
>   that originated the request always receive the same answer.
> - **CCTV world-click focus:** clicking an in-world CCTV icon or ambient card
>   activates it and routes the camera flight through the panel FOCUS policy.
>   Aircraft/satellite tracking releases outside cockpit; cockpit retains the
>   view, keeps the CCTV activation, and surfaces the existing refusal toast.
>   Auto-hop and programmatic camera activation remain activation-only. CCTV
>   world clicks must stay within 6 px and 400 ms; drag-like or long gestures
>   are inert, and re-clicking the already active camera emits no focus request.
>   A clean empty-space click clears the active CCTV camera in place without
>   moving the view or disabling the layer. Sibling-layer picks and ADJUST-mode
>   interactions never trigger that clear. The resulting null selection remains
>   stable across rendering and updates; configured auto-hop is held until a
>   later explicit activation or AUTO HOP toggle-on.
> - **Tracked-flight close-range feel:** the existing 150 m camera floor is
>   unchanged, while the selected-only civilian and military model cap is now
>   200 px so minimum range reads as close. Pointer travel over 6 px suppresses
>   selection and empty-space untracking; duration over 400 ms suppresses only
>   untracking, so a stationary slow press on a plane still selects it. Escape
>   still releases tracking in place. The 200 px feel needs close-range field
>   verification; fleet model sizing remains unchanged.
> - **Deterministic sprite stacking:** contact collections reassert the stable
>   bottom-to-top order CCTV, FIRMS, Établissements scolaires, Enseignement supérieur, Bornes IRVE, Réseau gaz, Power Grid, Groupes de prod,
>   bikeshare, Véhicules partagés (FR), Transit FR, AIS,
>   military, then civilian
>   — Véhicules partagés (FR) occupies its slot with TWO collections (station dots
>   below, vehicle glyphs above), registered in that order, so a parked scooter
>   paints over the dock it sits next to without either escaping the layer's
>   slot.
>   flights after every relevant layer init/enable and immediately after FIRMS
>   lazily registers its detection sprites. Always-visible contact
>   depth settings are unchanged. Cesium OIT weighted blending may soften strict
>   alpha layering on some GPUs, so the ordering remains a real-browser check.
> - **Deterministic card stacking:** CCTV, FIRMS, vessel, and tracked-target
>   cards use the shared world-overlay canvas. Detection paints through the
>   same host/frame contract onto one host-owned blend surface beneath that
>   canvas — parented into `#cesiumContainer` so its `screen` blend still
>   reaches the WebGL scene. The exact detection, ambient-label, ambient-track,
>   ambient-card, thumbnail, selected, and tracked lane sequence is binding;
>   the detection callback runs first and z-index preserves its shipped z5
>   position below the z6 cards.
> - **Cross-layer vessel ownership:** clicking a sibling-layer contact leaves
>   the active vessel card, HUD, context, and trail unchanged while the sibling
>   handles the pick, preventing two camera commands from one click. Starting entity tracking still clears vessel
>   inspection; AIS itself never sets `viewer.trackedEntity`. Own unkeyed or
>   evicted vessel-record picks and `gev-trail:*` remain no-ops. CCTV choices
>   made from the panel dropdown do not currently emit a cross-layer event and
>   therefore do not clear vessel inspection.
> - **World-overlay host and Phase 2–6 source migrations:**
>   `src/overlays/worldOverlay.js` owns one shared DPR-aware text/card canvas,
>   one detection blend surface, and one world-overlay post-render
>   scheduler. Both surfaces share the same sizing, clear, projection,
>   and teardown paths. The host includes bounded per-source/per-collision-domain
>   arbitration, horizon/viewport culling, shared keyhole fading, cached UI
>   exclusions, cockpit source gating, pooled hit
>   rectangles, and development diagnostics. **Stacked-copy cards
>   (`card`/`selected`/`tracked`) are bounded at `WORLD_OVERLAY_STYLE.cardMaxWidth`
>   = 420 CSS px**, tightened further by a narrow viewport, and wrap their title

>   PLACEMENT PREFERENCE over currently visible chrome — it clips no canvas and

>   `#cockpit-hud` z145 — is a soft preference, so an entry with no
>   collision-free placement keeps its full placement set and simply renders
>   beneath that chrome. Chrome at or BELOW the host keeps an absolute veto:
>   `#intel-hud` is z2, under both host surfaces (detection z5, cards z6), so a
>   kept placement there would paint over HUD text. Placement runs two passes —
>   prefer variants clear of all chrome, else variants clear of the below-host
>   chrome, else drop the entry. Cockpit line art (rims, arcs, rails, toplines, readouts) is not
>   in the inventory at all: the AR-HUD model puts world-space content beneath
>   the cockpit's screen-space HUD by z-order. Its empty-host path performs no
>   post-setup layout reads or canvas work under resize/mutation noise; removed
>   entry records are pruned, and text measurement uses a host-lifetime,

>   paint-item, and paint-rectangle storage; track display text is rebuilt only
>   when its title or detail changes. DOM mutations only flag exclusions dirty,
>   with selector/layout scans deferred until there is overlay paint work, and
>   host teardown severs pooled record/entry references before releasing every
>   pool. A custom paint-lane contract gives source-owned batched painters the
>   same DPR-sized context, per-frame view-projection matrix, ellipsoid
>   occluder, keyhole geometry, and cached UI rectangles without transferring
>   their selection policy into the host. Datacenters and Dams now publish card
>   entries into that host on their
>   existing 450 ms screen-grid cadence. Each source retains two deterministic
>   contenders per grid cell and publishes at most 160 entries. The legacy
>   700/900 winner ceilings are no longer the effective shipped caps; active
>   `ambient-card` source budgets sum to a bounded 1,150-card shared lane: two
>   96-card infrastructure budgets, FIRMS' shipped 18-card cohort, AIS's
>   existing configured 900-row absolute ceiling, and CCTV's shipped 40-card
>   ambient maximum. Runtime AIS demand still
>   derives from its shipped 118 px grid: 112 candidates at the 1600×900
>   allocation viewport and 170 at full HD; its existing 150 px greedy
>   separation usually admits fewer. The host owns final cross-source declutter
>   without letting source count grow beyond the pre-migration source bounds.
>   Cards use the infrastructure name plus available operator/capacity for
>   datacenters or river for dams. Their native Cesium points, stems, polygons,
>   selection/picking, terrain sampling, and enable/disable lifecycle remain in
>   `localGeojson.js`; it creates no native label graphics.
>   The bundled public-release snapshots omit contact-oriented fields and note
>   values containing email or phone identifiers. Runtime cards and entity
>   context do not depend on those fields; geometry, identity, name,
>   operator/capacity/river metadata, and ODbL attribution remain intact.
>   Stem position and
>   polyline properties are constant between initialization, camera `moveEnd`,
>   and successful near-surface ground samples rather than per-frame callbacks
>   or every 450 ms visibility pass. Unchanged or sub-0.5 m tips do not call
>   `setValue`, and each record alternates between two preallocated two-position
>   stem arrays so real tip changes notify Cesium without steady-state allocation.
>   Shared placement records retain the raw anchor plus one signed integer
>   leader offset; painters apply that offset without materializing four pairs
>   of computed doubles per entry. The arbiter's spread distances and compact
>   placement-availability masks live in pooled numeric buffers. Because solve
>   occupancy only grows, few-placement identities whose complete set is
>   blocked are dismissed once instead of being returned and re-spread; the
>   authoritative collision lookup remains the final semantic check. Protected
>   entries that cannot separate completely choose the placement with the least
>   total protected-rectangle overlap rather than stacking on the first option.
>   Cards use the host's shared keyhole fade and global detection fade/opacity
>   controls with no source-local edge constants; cached keyhole geometry is
>   invalidated by live tuning as well as canvas size, so Fade changes reach the
>   next frame. Outside opacity defaults to the shipped floor (5 % when this
>   landed; 1 % since the 2026-08-24 final lock, 3 % on 08-23). The
>   `KEYHOLE_OUTSIDE_OPACITY_DEFAULT` change from 0 to 0.05 also affects
>   detection: callouts and brackets previously hard-culled outside the keyhole
>   now paint at the OUTSIDE default (1% since the 2026-08-24 final lock;
>   aircraft brackets hold the 0.35 readable floor) and consume ambient budget
>   viewport-wide under the same
>   fade-don't-cull principle; this remains pending visual review. Cards
>   also reproduce the former
>   `scaleByDistance` curve (1.0× at 250 km to 0.62× at 9,000 km).
>   Mapped Military Installations create no empty native labels; selected names
>   remain in the tracked readout. Submarine-cable labels moved into the shared
>   host on 2026-08-18 (Option 2, superseding the Phase-5 Option-1 native
>   exception): the same nearest-160 bounded cohort now publishes
>   `ambient-label` entries on a dirty sweep with exactly two dirty
>   conditions — camera `moveEnd` / layer enable / load completion, plus a
>   motion fallback that samples the camera at most once per 2 s and only
>   re-arms past 250 m of travel since the last swept position, so tracked
>   and orbit cameras (which never emit `moveEnd`) cannot starve the sweep
>   while a parked camera still costs zero. The former 500 ms timer path was
>   removed in the same-day perf round — timer-driven stem re-sizes rebuilt
>   the 2,629-instance batched stem primitive mid-motion. The 2,629 reference
>   stems are staticized constants (no per-frame `CallbackProperty`), and an
>   unchanged cohort is never republished so a parked camera stays
>   governor-idle at the source level.
>   The 2026-08-18
>   host fix extends that to the HOST level: chrome mutation observation is
>   scoped (body childList filtered to inventory-chrome add/remove;
>   per-occluder attribute observation element-only, no subtree) and the
>   right-rail allocator writes `--right-panel-allocated-height` only on real
>   change, so parked idle with ANY live overlay source measures 0 postRender
>   fires / 5 s — empty-scene control parity (pre-fix ~56-61; dams
>   cross-checked at 0). Genuine chrome changes (occluder add/remove,
>   own-attribute flips, resizes) still invalidate;
>   `qa-cables-overlay.mjs` gates idle at ≤6 / 5 s.
> - **Phase 6 detection consolidation:** `src/data/detection.js` retains its own
>   `LabelArbiter` instance and existing 125 ms solve cadence, density/altitude
>   budgets, layer quotas, Elastic/Weighted allocation, manual scalar matrix
>   projection, tier palette, batched bracket paths, callout painter,
>   acquire/keyhole fades, sparse focus ring, banner, scanlines, suspension, and
>   diagnostic object. It no longer creates or sizes a canvas, clears pixels,
>   builds a camera matrix or UI inventory, observes layout, or attaches a
>   render listener. The host creates and lifecycle-manages
>   `#world-overlay-detection-surface`, DPR-sizes it through the same frame path
>   as `#world-overlay-canvas`, and invokes detection against its
>   plain source-over context. Detection writes the exact shipped theme
>   `mixBlendMode` and `filter + drop-shadow(...)` strings to that provided
>   element, preserving scene-level CRT/NVG/FLIR glow and once-per-layer
>   filtering. The surface is host-owned but **parented into `#cesiumContainer`
>   at `z-index:5`**, not into `#world-overlay-root`: the root is a stacking
>   context (`z-index:6`), i.e. an isolated blending group, and a surface inside
>   it has its `mix-blend-mode: screen` silently discarded by the browser
>   instead of compositing against the WebGL scene. z-index (5 under the root's
>   6) keeps it beneath ambient-through-tracked host paint.
>   The >22 ms odd-frame relief valve is restored: the host does not clear the
>   detection surface on a held frame, while unrelated shared lanes repaint,
>   and `throttleSkipCount` remains a live diagnostic. Detection `data-*` fields
>   now live on `#world-overlay-canvas`, while the StyleManager diagnostic API
>   remains unchanged. Disable and suspension deactivate only the detection
>   lane, leaving unrelated host entries intact; teardown unregisters the lane
>   before the host is destroyed. The production-shaped allocation gate covers
>   5,000 visible Dense observations at 2,500 km under the unchanged 154
>   B/observation/frame ceiling. The host owns one world-overlay `postRender`
>   listener; the repository has five `postRender` listeners total (host,
>   celestial ring, annotations SVG, missions frame tick, and traffic).
> - **World-label accounting:** All intended label/card migrations use the
>   shared host. The former native `LabelGraphics` exception for cable reference
>   labels was retired on 2026-08-18; cable text may render over tile geometry,
>   so **zero native world-label creation sites remain**. The mission replay DOM vehicle, awareness
>   compass, annotation SVG callouts, and host-owned detection isolation target
>   are explicit exceptions; the awareness ring and cockpit contact pips are
>   non-text out-of-scope surfaces. Annotation callout text, geometry, leaders,
>   and behavior retain their tested presentation; a future annotation style
>   system is outside this phase. `src/overlays/worldOverlayTokens.js` is the single home for
>   shared world-overlay, CCTV-thumbnail, and detection-theme presentation
>   constants. Former source renderers own no canvas, DPR, or world-overlay
>   listener path; the duplicate detection rounded-rectangle helper and dead
>   tactical compatibility helpers are gone. No temporary dual-renderer flag
>   existed to remove. `activeCameraCardEnabled` remains a product
>   presentation control, and `_detectionUserOverridden` remains the documented
>   style-switch persistence state. Browser/GPU performance comparison remains
>   operator-side; the final accounting records only comparable population
>   reductions and deterministic Node allocation/solve measurements. Those
>   allocation gates are calibrated on Node.js 24.14.x; `package.json` permits
>   supported product runtimes on Node 24 or 26, while the allocation runner
>   separately enforces Node 24 for these two calibrated probes. Each probe
>   compiles synchronously and discards explicit-GC
>   transition chunks before applying the unchanged byte ceilings. The unit
>   runner executes ordinary test files with Node's default parallelism, then
>   runs only the two explicit-GC allocation microbenchmark files sequentially
>   and one at a time with `--expose-gc`, so unrelated tests cannot perturb their
>   calibrated budgets and each isolated test process has the same GC contract
>   as its measurement worker.
>   A worker spawn, exit, output, or availability failure is a failing gate, not
>   a passing skip.
> - **Phase 5 earthquake labels:** Earthquake disc ellipses and pickable
>   entities remain Cesium-native, but their magnitude text is now an
>   `ambient-label` source in the shared world-overlay host. The source formats
>   `M#.#` text and depth-band accent colors, publishes only the 96 largest
>   current events with stable id tie-breaking, and declares a 48-winner
>   ambient-label budget. Host keyhole fading, horizon culling, UI exclusion,
>   and final collision apply. Disable/destroy clear and hide the source; real
>   earthquake entities carry no native label graphic.
> - **Phase 5 bikeshare selection:** The selected station keeps its native cyan
>   point highlight, while its station name, availability counts, capacity, and
>   operational warnings now publish as one protected selected-lane host card.
>   The card reads the point's authoritative Cartesian directly, declares zero
>   ambient quota, and therefore cannot be evicted by ambient budgets. Shared
>   keyhole fading, horizon culling, UI exclusion, and selected-card paint
>   order apply. Clear, disable, and destroy remove the host entry; the selected
>   Cesium entity carries no label graphic.
> - **Phase 5 ISS and tracked-satellite labels:** The ISS path and large red
>   point remain native, while persistent `ISS` text is a one-entry moving
>   ambient-label host source. Its getter reads the already-propagated point
>   cache, preserving the 1 Hz fleet epoch and eliminating the former second ISS
>   propagation. Satellite tracking continues to publish exactly one protected
>   tracked-lane card through `gevLabelModel` and `_trackedDisplayCached`; the
>   tracked entity is point-only. Tracking ISS suppresses the ambient entry and
>   untracking restores it, preventing duplicate ISS text. Disable, orbit-text
>   preference changes, catalog rebuild, and destroy clear/hide the source.
> - **Phase 5 active CCTV projection label:** The active camera's monitor plane
>   remains native Cesium geometry, while its camera-name label is one protected
>   selected-lane host entry. The entry closes over the same cached
>   `positions.label` Cartesian updated whenever the plane geometry moves, so
>   label and plane retain a single placement authority. Only the active,
>   projection-visible camera publishes; hide, disable, runtime destruction,
>   and state clear remove the source. Monitor-plane entities carry no native
>   label graphic.
> - **Phase 5 tracked civil aircraft label:** A tracked flight's Cesium entity
>   is a billboard-only camera target with no native label. The flight source
>   retains callsign/registration fallback, flight-level/altitude, speed, stale
>   state, airline/type, and plausible-route formatting in `gevLabelModel`; the
>   one protected tracked-lane host card renders that complete model. Its
>   position getter reads only `_trackedDisplayCached`, the same authoritative
>   Cartesian already consumed by the tracked visual and camera, and never
>   advances dead reckoning from the host frame.
> - **Aircraft label convention (both flight layers, 2026-08-18):** every civil
>   and military label surface resolves **callsign → registration → icao24**
>   (`_contactLabel()` in `flights.js`; the same chain inline in
>   `militaryFlights.js`) — tracked readout, detection card, `getNearby`,
>   `getDetectableObjects`, `getAllPositions().label`, `getTrackedSubject`, the
>   analyst record, the Context subject/nearest list, the Cockpit signal list,
>   and the `track_entity` voice narration. Registration is aircraft IDENTITY,
>   not route, so unlike origin/destination it is **not** routePlausible-gated.
>   Identity stays `icao24` on every keyed surface (`getNearby().icao24`, the
>   detection `sourceId` declutter hashes, and the `id` that `trackById` and the
>   Context cohorts resolve) — only the displayed string follows the chain.
>   Because adsbdb enrichment can answer *after* selection, the Context subject
>   re-resolves its label each refresh (`resolveSubjectLabel()`) instead of
>   freezing the selection-time snapshot.
> - **Phase 5 tracked military aircraft label:** The military tracking entity
>   is likewise billboard-only and label-free. Its source-owned model retains
>   callsign/registration fallback, stale cue, aircraft type, registration,
>   operator, altitude, and speed, rendered as the sole protected tracked-lane
>   card with the amber military accent. Its getter reads only the military
>   `_trackedDisplayCached` publisher, keeping the host, visual, and camera on
>   one dead-reckoned frame sample.
> - **Phase 5b Space Mission labels:** Launch markers publish through a bounded
>   48-candidate / 24-winner ambient-label source. Selecting a mission clears
>   that overview and publishes its launch-site, stage re-entry, payload
>   position, and orbit annotations as protected selected-lane entries; every
>   source-formatted line and accent remains intact. Static entries reuse the
>   mission geometry Cartesians, the payload getter reads its per-frame live
>   cache, and catalog-backed orbit text reads the cache updated with the ring
>   matrix. Refresh, deselect, disable, and destroy replace or clear the real
>   sources. Mission Cesium entities carry no label graphics, and the shared
>   host replaces the former quadratic label overlap pass.
> - **Phase 5 cable depth-testing decision (2026-08-02, REVISED 2026-08-18 →
>   Option 2):** the 2026-08-02 ruling kept submarine-cable reference labels
>   native (`disableDepthTestDistance: 0`) as the sole approved world-label
>   exception so photorealistic tiles could occlude label text. On 2026-08-18
>   that exception was retired after performance measurement: the native
>   path evaluated 5,258 `CallbackProperty` channels per frame across 2,629
>   reference entities and re-batched a 160-label `LabelCollection` per sweep,
>   costing the layer ~9.5 ms/frame during camera motion (≈42 → ≈59 fps
>   measured headless at a mid-Atlantic orbit). Cable text is now a bounded
>   nearest-160 `ambient-label` host cohort (`telegeographySubmarineCables.js`
>   publishes on the dirty sweep — `moveEnd`/enable plus the 2 s/250 m motion
>   fallback for tracked and orbit cameras — skipping identical
>   cohorts); stems/points stay Cesium-native, depth-tested, and pickable, so
>   only TEXT lost tile occlusion — the same trade every other host label
>   already shipped: labels may render on top of tiles. The dedicated
>   `submarine-cables` allocation row gates
>   the new source at 17,015 B/frame median (106.3 B/candidate, Node 24)
>   under a 19,000 budget, and the all-live aggregate row was recalibrated
>   with the cable cohort folded in (164,711 B/frame median, 190.6
>   B/candidate, 182,000 budget); the intermediate phase rows keep their
>   historical pre-cable composition. `load()` carries a load-generation
>   ownership token (the militaryAwareness activationId pattern): a stale
>   aborted load bails after every await and never clears a successor's
>   lifecycle, so rapid toggle/destroy sequences cannot double-add data
>   sources.
>   The 639-candidate Phase-5b row (353 painted, 133,769 B/frame, 209.3
>   B/candidate) remains as an intermediate historical gate; as of the
>   2026-08-18 recalibration the all-live aggregate — every shared-host
>   source including Radio and the migrated cable cohort — is 864 candidates
>   / 398 painted at 164,711 B/frame (190.6 B/candidate) under a 182,000
>   budget. The image-inclusive ceiling remains attributable to CCTV, while
>   the isolated mission row measures 108.2 B/candidate/frame under the
>   shared 154 ceiling.
>   FIRMS severity/source formatting, its pre-existing 150 px greedy selector,
>   selected-fire semantics, and LOD distance limits stay in `firmsHeatmap.js`;
>   `firmsLabels.js` is formatting-only. FIRMS entries use the host's tactical
>   card painter, vertical above/below placement, severity top rule, shared UI
>   exclusion/clip, horizon culling, distance-alpha channel, and always-on
>   `edgeFade: 'keyhole'` policy. Selected fires are protected in the selected
>   lane and bypass both the 18-card ambient cohort and distance fade while
>   excluding ambient cards from their footprint. Disable and destroy clear
>   the source rather than leaving a stale host entry. This is not a
>   pixel-for-pixel port: global collision/UI avoidance can choose fewer cards,
>   host horizon culling is explicit, and ordinary map mode now retains the
>   shared Outside floor instead of bypassing edge fade through the former
>   cockpit/celestial gate.
> - **Vessel card ownership:** `aisLiveVessels.js` retains the 800 ms visibility
>   pass, 118 px one-winner grid, priority ranking, 150 px greedy separation,
>   type/detail formatting, and the AIS positions produced by its unchanged sea
>   datum path. It publishes ambient tactical cards and one protected selected
>   card into the host. `vesselLabels.js` is formatting/policy-only: no vessel
>   canvas, projection, paint loop, or post-render listener remains. Ambient
>   vessels share `ambient-card`; the selected entry paints in the selected lane,
>   bypasses the ambient cohort/distance fade, and its protected rectangle
>   excludes sibling ambient cards. Tracked readout still excludes AIS, avoiding
>   a duplicate card for the same selection. Disable and destroy clear the host
>   source. This is not a pixel-for-pixel port: shared cross-source collision,
>   UI exclusion, and horizon culling can admit fewer cards than the isolated
>   canvas, and the shared always-on keyhole policy now applies the shipped
>   Outside floor in ordinary map mode instead of using the interim active-mask
>   gate.
> - **Tracked-readout ownership:** `trackedReadout.js` is now a presentation-model
>   bridge only; it owns no canvas, projection, post-render listener, layout,
>   keyhole fade, or paint path. Civilian flights, military flights, satellites,
>   and mapped installations write explicit `gevLabelModel` objects and expose
>   `gevDisplayPosition` getters backed by their layer-owned frame/display cache.
>   Selected AIS vessels continue using the vessel source's protected selected
>   card, so they do not create a duplicate tracked readout. The host registers
>   the active readout in the protected tracked lane with a zero ambient quota;
>   protected semantics bypass that quota and reserve the painted footprint
>   against ambient cards. Moving sources never fall back to a fresh
>   `entity.position.getValue()` in post-render. Annotation fade queries the
>   host's actual `getOverlayPaintRect('tracked', trackedId)` after layout and
>   unions it with the tracked billboard extent. Untrack, context clear, and UI
>   destroy clear/hide the source. This is not a pixel-for-pixel port: placement
>   is host-rounded, cross-source/UI exclusion and horizon culling now apply,
>   accents are source-stable rather than detection-theme-derived, and the old
>   screen-coordinate deadband was removed in favor of the authoritative layer
>   frame cache.
>   Civilian and military poll reconciliation refreshes this model after fresh
>   kinematics and again when a missed poll enters the `STALE` grace period.
>   Satellite pre-render propagation refreshes its altitude line from the same
>   per-frame SGP4 sample used by the tracked dot and camera.
> - **CCTV thumbnail ownership:** `cctv.js` retains the 20/28/40 zoom selection,
>   40-card shipped maximum, 112 px source declutter, eviction grace, frame
>   fetching/cadence/retry, stable slot cache, last-success persistence, hover
>   pinning, and activation. `cctvCards.js` is now source policy plus pure
>   lifecycle helpers only; it owns no canvas, post-render subscription,
>   Cesium projection, layout solve, paint pass, or hit store. The shared host
>   paints its exact 96×54 thumbnail inside the 104×77 shipped chrome, applies
>   the same 1.0→0.45→0.35 altitude scale and 7,500→9,500 m fade, shared
>   keyhole fade, full UI exclusions, and tracked/protected footprint
>   exclusion. Ambient entries paint nothing before their first successful
>   frame; a user-pinned entry retains the documented immediate empty-chrome
>   exception, and later failures never clear the last successful frame. The
>   active camera is excluded from the 40-card ambient quota and has no host
>   card by default: its monitor plane is the active representation. The
>   product option `cctvLayer.setCardPresentationOptions({
>   activeCameraCardEnabled: true })` may publish it through the retained
>   protected path. CCTV leaders use the source cyan, remain vertical at the
>   camera anchor except for the off-card edge clamp, and counter-scale to one
>   CSS pixel through the altitude transform. Card hits come from
>   `hitTestWorldOverlay` after a
>   scene pick miss with no canonical scene-object ID. CCTV billboard ownership
>   is proven by the owning collection/object rather than a bare upstream ID,
>   so an independent sibling with a colliding ID still wins. As a completed,
>   narrowly extended ownership hardening step, property-bearing Entity picks
>   must also be the exact stored CCTV coverage/projection object; copying the
>   `cctvCameraId` property cannot impersonate a camera. Card hits pass through the
>   6 px / 400 ms gesture guard
>   before activation and the existing click-to-fly event. CCTV cards are not
>   sprite-focus-dimmed. Disable/destroy clear and hide the host source, stop
>   pacing, detach in-flight image handlers, and empty source caches.
> - **Cockpit left-panel chrome:** opening any left-stack panel fades the
>   overlapping left pitch-rail glyphs out. The separately right-anchored pitch
>   rail remains visible, and panel/context-card stacking is unchanged.
> - **Cockpit context stacking:** the context card renders above visor glass,
>   pitch/heading instruments, altitude/speed tapes, and the signal window.
>   Topline vision and exit controls retain the highest in-cockpit layer.
> - **Space Missions dependency shutdown:** disabling a mission dependency or
>   leaving the mode closes mission context and restores the exact pre-entry
>   Satellite enabled state and presentation parameters. Restored parameters
>   never re-show primitives while the Satellite layer is disabled.
> - **Flights 3D/cockpit hardening:** the destination-direction cue is an
>   inline SVG rather than a remotely loaded Material Icons ligature, so a
>   blocked or late font can no longer expand the literal word `navigation`
>   across the cockpit. The grounded `airplane.glb` belly offset is calibrated
>   to the current asset's measured Y-up bounds (`0.063` native units).
>   Contact Previous/Next and Live Signals aircraft handoffs now
>   re-seed the first-person camera anchor at the selected flight immediately;
>   bounded feed-correction smoothing remains scoped to the same aircraft.
>   When NEXT has no flight inside the normal 250 km Context window, it searches
>   both civilian and military feeds at successively doubled radii through
>   16,000 km and transfers the cockpit to the closest available aircraft.
>   Tracked cameras now share one ENU frame across Cesium and the close-range
>   guard: switches relocate to the new aircraft, zoom stops 150 m short of
>   crossing the target, and the icon/model, label, trail head, and camera are
>   prepared from the same frame. The guard frames once and then leaves
>   Cesium's EntityView as the sole continuous camera writer. The tracked
>   entity remains a pure position/billboard target with no unused aircraft
>   orientation input; 3D→2D handoffs seed the current screen-projected course,
>   course projection uses the camera's right/up basis so it remains valid
>   through the >180° rear half of a tracked orbit, and the host readout consumes
>   that same settled frame cache without a second dead-reckon. Selected
>   3D models are seeded at the tracked position before scene insertion and
>   update before scene preparation from one frame-cached sample, retain real-world scale at
>   ordinary ranges, cap at 200 px
>   when very close for a continuous 2D→3D handoff, and use a 40 px selected
>   model floor near the long-range 3D→2D cutoff so the glTF silhouette remains
>   comparable to the selected billboard; ambient model sizing is unchanged.
> - **Minimal HUD right rail:** constrained focus layout keeps the collapsed
>   CCTV and Context launchers visible and accessible while the expanded
>   Display panel scrolls inside an explicit remaining-height budget. The rail
>   reserves both launcher heights and inter-panel gaps without a self-reversing
>   layout measurement. Tactical HUD instead gives the expanded Display, CCTV,
>   or Context panel exclusive use of the rail and hides its collapsed siblings
>   until the active panel is collapsed.
> - **Context-flow hardening:** the cockpit left accordion stays below the HUD
>   inside its measured safe top/bottom lane. Global Context focus guards exist
>   only for the synchronous selection window, history survives same-layer
>   reselection, and NEXT availability uses the same UNKNOWN-cohort gate as the
>   navigation action. Contacts entry does not wait for unrelated serialized
>   layer teardown; Space Missions waits for every incompatible live/current
>   layer to settle off before replay data starts. A rejected teardown keeps
>   that layer authoritatively enabled, restores any siblings already stopped,
>   and aborts replay entry; the isolation
>   guard remains active until Rocket Launches finishes enabling. Manually enabling
>   another Data Layer is additive in both an active mode and the neutral shell:
>   it does not exit Context, and the added layer joins the pre-entry snapshot
>   when the session is eventually restored. Manually disabling a required mode
>   dependency still exits and restores that union.
>   While Space Missions is active, direct incompatible enables are refused
>   before initialization or polling and explain that the mode must be exited.
>   User entry alone owns the pre-entry snapshot; programmatic dependencies do
>   not replace it, and rapid re-entry snapshots the pending settled restore
>   target rather than partial manager state.
>   Contacts-mode entry chooses the nearest aircraft to the current camera from
>   one uncapped civilian-plus-military pool (military wins an exact distance
>   tie), then falls back to the nearest AIS vessel. An initially empty set gets
>   one retry on the next Awareness refresh tick rather than permanently losing
>   automatic acquisition. Clearing a manually selected subject cancels that
>   pending retry so an intentional deselection cannot acquire another contact.
>   NEXT keeps a cycle-scoped visited set separate from PREVIOUS history. Once
>   every current target is visited, it starts a deterministic new walk with the
>   current subject retained as visited instead of re-admitting all candidates
>   into a nearest-contact ping-pong. Expanded flight searches use the same reset
>   rule. Vessel focus uses a 3 km bounding sphere at entry and during cycling.
>   The user-facing mode is **CONTACTS**: it cycles the nearest contact of
>   whichever supported type is selected (civilian or military plane, AIS vessel,
>   or mapped installation). Satellites are explicitly outside the Awareness
>   navigation cohorts and retain their independent tracking UX. The cockpit
>   briefing opt-in is labeled `CYCLE OFF` / `CYCLE ON`, with state-specific help
>   that distinguishes page cycling from continuously refreshed live data. The
>   neutral standby summarizes both chooser modes, while the `CONTACTS` and cycle
>   controls keep their short visible state as the accessible name and expose
>   longer help only as a title.
> - **CCTV focus and teardown:** explicit camera choices still activate during
>   cockpit mode, but they retain aircraft tracking, suppress the view flight,
>   and ask the user to exit cockpit. Layer enable is activation-only when a
>   tracked entity or cockpit owns the view, with no flight or cockpit-exit toast.
>   Voice select/next/previous/nearest actions report when tracking or cockpit
>   refuses their requested flight without hiding the successful selection.
>   Camera deactivation and layer disable both clear temporary probe clamps;
>   disable re-arms the active record, re-enable restores nominal geometry without
>   probing, and the next real activation re-runs the obstruction probe. Disable
>   uses a direct hide sweep; obstruction hits retain the field-derived 12 m floor.
>   Geometry-drain progress notifications are coalesced to roughly 300 ms or ten
>   batches, whichever arrives first. Natural completion publishes its final
>   state; disable publishes the terminal state explicitly when it cancels a drain.
>   Coverage polylines are lazy: catalog init creates none, while enable in the
>   default COVERAGE ON mode materializes the active camera and visible neighbor
>   cohort (70 entities at the 14-camera cap). Activation always materializes the
>   selected frustum, including COVERAGE OFF when projection remains on.
>   Empty-space deselection removes the active projection and active-relative
>   coverage emphasis but preserves the layer, coverage mode, ambient cards,
>   catalog, panel settings, and viewer pose. With no active camera the panel
>   exposes no stale dropdown/FOCUS/calibration target; NEXT starts at the first
>   catalog entry and PREVIOUS starts at the last.
>   While aircraft tracking or cockpit mode owns the view, the geometry drain
>   rechecks ownership per batch and drops to two records every 250 ms. Enable
>   focus decisions conservatively combine pre- and post-await ownership.
> - Share-link camera restoration re-applies its settled pose and requests a
>   render after the flight completes, ensuring Google Photorealistic 3D Tiles
>   stream at a deep-link destination without requiring manual camera input.
> - **Reversible Context handoff:** enabling Global Context snapshots the exact
>   enabled-layer set and every runtime parameter it changes, then clears
>   unrelated active Data Layers. Mode switches, required-dependency disables, direct
>   disable, and teardown restore that pre-entry state before control leaves
>   Context. Directly switching between Flights and Space Missions remains
>   supported without losing the original snapshot. Contacts waits for the
>   dependency releases it owns before restoring that snapshot, so the first
>   Space Missions selection completes without a stale teardown superseding it.
> - **Space Mission horizon occlusion:** mission dots and hover reticles apply
>   their surface-anchor horizon state before Cesium draws or picks the frame,
>   while shared-host labels use the same hidden-globe horizon contract. Rear-side
>   markers therefore cannot remain from the prior camera frame, including in
>   request-on-demand photoreal views; the conservative limb margin remains.
>   Graphics that begin with Cesium's implicit visible default are enrolled in
>   that pass on their first frame rather than bypassing the cull.
>   Selecting a mission isolates its launch anchor until Show All / Deselect
>   or the panel close control clears the selection.
> - **Cockpit flight signals:** Live Signals shows the current and nearest
>   flight names as larger clickable controls. Selecting a name transfers the
>   active cockpit tracker to that flight; type and distance remain secondary
>   text without repetitive event-category headings.
> - **Ground-safe cockpit:** the first-person anchor and final camera position
>   are clamped to the shared mesh-first rendered-surface floor with 12 m of
>   clearance. In the photoreal stack, grounded entry keeps the existing safe
>   map camera until that rendered mesh cell resolves instead of trusting a
>   delayed/raw aircraft height as a temporary surface. Successful one-shot
>   model ground snaps populate the same shared mesh cache, and repeated
>   grounded source timestamps lift their stored history when the floor warms.
>   Landing and taxi tracks therefore cannot place the camera below terrain or
>   inside photoreal 3D Tiles.
> - **Display panel width:** across desktop HUD layouts, the expanded right-rail
>   Display panel uses a 272 px glass-backed surface; its collapsed tab and
>   narrow-screen layout retain their existing responsive widths.
> - **Cockpit rolling telemetry:** the central speed, heading, and altitude
>   values use per-digit vertical rolls when their displayed values change.
>   Increasing and decreasing values move in opposite directions, and heading
>   accounts for the 359°/000° wrap.
> - **Cockpit route cue:** when reliable destination coordinates are available,
>   the estimated-destination arrow occupies a fixed centered slot above the
>   lower telemetry, follows the apparent ground-plane perspective, and rotates
>   to show relative bearing within a legible ±120° steering range. Flights
>   without destination enrichment omit the cue.
> - The skylight feature set and six field-test hardening rounds shipped
>   2026-07-03; **CCTV v2** shipped 2026-07-04.
>   Voice tools were **28** at this milestone (**29** in the live runtime — see
>   the layer-vocabulary note below). Global Context can be entered or exited directly,
>   and Cockpit voice control supports status, entry from a selected or tracked
>   aircraft (establishing Contacts first), exit, and filtered Previous/Next navigation through the full
>   nearby-contact cohort. Contacts exposes source-honest counts inside its
>   250 km subject window.
> - **Height-datum system (2026-07-08):** Caltrans + TfL camera packs (~900
>   cameras) and the height-datum work fix entity heights on the
>   ellipsoidal globe end-to-end (geoid module, keyless Re:Earth terrain for the
>   OSM stack, ground-floor system with rendered-mesh sampling, always-visible
>   sprites/trails, OpenSky credit governor). The 2026-07-08 CHANGELOG entry
>   records the subsystem's architecture, invariants, residuals, and verification.
> - **Height-datum test surface:** `npm test` 184 unit · `npm run
>   test:track` 43 tracking invariants · headless QA harnesses under
>   `scripts/qa-*.mjs` incl. `qa-height-datum.mjs` (numeric heights) and
>   `qa-floor-verify.mjs` (any-airport ground-truth oracle).
> - **2026-08-19 — display-time ground floor (flights layer).** A grounded
>   contact's render height is picked once per poll from the floor of its FIX
>   cell, but what renders is the dead-reckoned position, which drifts across
>   cells for the whole segment and for hundreds of metres while a contact
>   coasts on a stale feed. On a graded apron that buried sprites under the
>   mesh (measured −15.5 m at KAUS; `qa-floor-verify` reported FAIL). The fleet
>   pass and the tracked display path now re-floor the DISPLAYED coordinate
>   against `cachedGroundFloor` — read-only, grounded contacts only, and never
>   while a 3D model owns the visual (T7 ground-snap one-shot). The poll's floor
>   warm/sample batch additionally collects each grounded contact's display
>   CORRIDOR (the ground it is about to cross — toward its newest fix while
>   interpolating, along its course while coasting), need-ranked and deduped so
>   parked contacts never crowd out moving ones. Budget is charged only for cells
>   with no floor yet — warm cells are still emitted, because the mesh sampler
>   must see a cell again once its DEM prior lands — which gives a service bound
>   that falls out of the policy: every contact is served within
>   `ceil(contacts / budget)` polls. Sample spacing along a projected arc derives
>   from its length (never a fixed count, whose spacing widens with speed), and
>   the cell walk steps at an eighth of a cell, so any cell the path occupies for
>   ~14 m of ground or more is collected. The corridor
>   integrates the SAME constant-rate turn the dead-reckon does, so a
>   sustained-turn taxi warms its arc rather than a straight tangent. Visual
>   ownership — not model existence — decides when the clamp stands aside: a model
>   owns the visual only while it is actually RENDERING (`ready && show`, the
>   pair the billboard handoff itself consults), and the tracked path also
>   requires `_trackedModelRegimeActive()`. So neither a retained-but-hidden
>   model (3D off, zoomed out, cockpit) nor one still loading suppresses
>   flooring while the billboard is what the user sees. **The visual/data split is deliberate**: visual
>   consumers are floored at the per-frame cache, while `_describeFlight` — and
>   so `findByQuery`, `getTrackedInfo`, `getTrackedSubject` — keeps reporting
>   sensor truth (barometric `altitudeM`, fix-time `renderAltitudeM`), because a
>   query or an altimeter should answer what the aircraft reported, not where its
>   icon was nudged to clear the tiles. Residual, unchanged by this
>   work: the floor is a ~111 m cell, so intra-cell relief (terminals, jet
>   bridges) and contacts moving faster than the 30 s warm batch can still read
>   metres low. `qa-floor-verify.mjs` now **exits non-zero on FAIL** (1 = FAIL,
>   2 = INCONCLUSIVE); it previously exited 0 on every verdict, which is how the
>   burial stayed invisible. It also honours `QA_BASE_URL` and puppeteer's
>   pinned Chrome-for-Testing, like the other harnesses.
> - **2026-07-16:** the FIRMS Active Fires layer is **LIVE** —
>   the bundled 2026-05-25 snapshot (58 MB) is deleted; a new `/api/firms` proxy
>   (vite.config.js) merges VIIRS NOAA-20/NOAA-21/Suomi-NPP NRT world CSVs
>   (days=2 → trailing-24h clamp, 30 min memory+disk cache, single-flight,
>   serve-stale-on-failure) behind server-side `FIRMS_MAP_KEY` (keyless → 503 +

> **2026-07-02 milestone:** the skylight aircraft/satellite/enrichment work and
> pre-ship hardening fixes landed.
> Runtime changes reflected below: **voice tools 17→20 at the 2026-07-02 milestone** (`next_iss_pass` + the 19 already on
> main), type-aware 8-class aircraft sprites + path-derived rate-limited display heading, adsbdb
> flight enrichment (cached proxy + route-plausibility gate), disk-cached CelesTrak TLE proxy,
> ISS pass prediction, and per-layer data attribution. Gate at close: unit 98/98, build clean,
> track 19/19, + five QA harnesses (heading 16/16, sprites 9/9, cctv 5/5, failstate 5/5,
> attribution 18/18). New modules: `src/data/{motionModel,aircraftMeta,aircraftClass,aircraftIcons,issPass,routePlausible,dataCredits}.js`.
> The live runtime now declares **29** voice tools; the 17→20 count above is retained only as milestone history.
>
> **Layer vocabulary (2026-09-09).** The 29th tool is `list_layers`, and it
> arrived with the repair it exists to make checkable. `set_layer_visibility`
> and `show_data_layers_menu` had carried a hand-written enum of **17** layer
> ids since upstream while this fork registered **60** layers, so 43 of them —
> every French one — could not be NAMED by the model, which reported them as
> nonexistent when asked. All four layer enums (`set_layer_visibility`,
> `show_data_layers_menu`, `get_entity_context`, `analyst_query`) are now
> derived from `src/voice/layerVocabulary.js`, which reads `LAYER_TAXONOMY`;
> `src/voice/layerVocabulary.test.mjs` fails if the shipped literals drift from
> it, the same mechanism `src/locations.test.mjs` uses for the fly-to presets.
> `normalizeLayerId` resolves ids, French and English aliases, and panel labels
> with accents and case folded away. An unknown layer now returns
> `suggestions` instead of throwing.
>
> **Reading the data (2026-09-09).** `get_entity_context` reads the selection
> off ANY layer that implements `getSelectedInfo()` — not just the four
> trackable families — and adds `nearby`, the closest loaded records to the view
> target with `distanceKm`. `bikeshare`, `irve-fr`, `medecins-fr`,
> `shared-mobility-fr` and `transit-fr` gained `getSelectedInfo()` and
> `getAnalystRecords()`; `ANALYST_LAYERS` went from 5 entries to 23 (with
> `dvf-sales`), so the French point layers are queryable. The engine now REFUSES a filter naming a
> field the queried layer does not publish and names the real fields — an
> unknown field used to match nothing and answer "zero".
>
> **What a layer has MEASURED (2026-09-09).** Some layers do not answer "how
> many are there" — they answer "what is it worth here", and that number has a
> method behind it (a radius, a set of comparables, a named denominator). A
> layer publishes it by implementing `getVoiceSummary()`, and
> `get_entity_context` carries every enabled layer's under `layerSummaries`.
> `dvf-sales` publishes the block median €/m², its quartiles, how many of the
> sales in the radius carry a price at all, and the commune median they are
> read against; `avis-valeur` publishes the estimate, its `basis`
> (`comparables` / `range` / `none`) and its interval. The figures are LIFTED
> from `getStats()`, never re-derived: an average of the drawn markers would be
> a second number for one question, computed by a different rule than the card.
> Each summary carries `measuredAt`; a summary measured further from the view
> target than the layer's own radius is replaced by `pending`, because the
> camera-driven layers hold the last block they scanned until the next answer
> lands. A layer that has not scanned yet publishes `pending` too — silence read
> as "there is nothing here".
>
> **ON is not VISIBLE, and the view fixes itself (2026-09-09).**
> `set_layer_visibility` results carry `drawing` and, when false,
> `notDrawnBecause`: `loading`, `source-error`, or `nothing-in-view`. `ok` stays
> true; the layer IS on. Loading-versus-broken is decided by the shared
> `layerFeedState()` so a layer that puts its zoom prompt in `stats.error` is
> not reported as down.
>
> When the obstacle is CAMERA HEIGHT the tool descends instead of reporting:
> `descendToLayerScan` flies — through `fly_to_location`, so one navigation
> policy — straight down onto the view target already in frame, calls
> `refreshLayer`, and returns the fresh drawing report plus `viewAdjusted`.
> Measured 23 027 m → 516 m over Bordeaux, 12 sales drawn. The framing follows
> the layer's declared REACH (`scanReachM` on `createAddressScanLayer`; 300 m
> for `dvf-sales` and `avis-valeur`) at three radii — `scanDescentRangeM()` —
> not the ceiling, which for DVF would stop at 7 km. A layer that declares no
> reach falls back to 60 % of its own ceiling, so `bruit-fr` (dormant at 250 km
> because it draws a regional outline) is not dragged to a street corner. With
> no ground point under the camera nothing moves and the layer's own explanation
> stands.
>
> **Situation preamble (2026-09-09).** The OpenRouter text brain posts a short
> `user` message before each turn — camera, place, active layers, selection,
> Contacts window (`buildSituationBrief`, hung off the action runner as
> `describeSituation`). Only the newest one is kept in the history. The Realtime
> session does not use it: it already gets view state from
> `get_current_view_state` and screenshots.

## Canonical Docs Order

Use docs in this order when details conflict:

1. `docs/CURRENT-STATE.md` (this file)
2. `docs/opensky-auth.md` (OpenSky authentication)
3. `docs/CHRONICLE.md` (what the server records and why, and the license line on
   an accumulated database)
4. `CHANGELOG.md` (release history)

Historical planning documents may not match runtime behavior.

## Current Baseline

- The project is **Surplomb** (`mml-studio/surplomb`), a French fork of
  `bilawalsidhu/gods-eye-view`. Repository metadata, public URLs and the
  User-Agent strings sent to data operators carry that identity. The
  `godsEyeView.*` localStorage namespace does NOT: renaming it would wipe every
  existing reader's panel positions, CCTV calibration and saved dossiers, so it
  is deliberately frozen under the old spelling. Runtime behavior is defined by
  this document and the current source tree rather than historical branch notes.

## Runtime Stack

- Vite + CesiumJS app with Google Photorealistic 3D Tiles
- Scene/HUD/style systems in `src/ui.js` and `src/hud.js`
- Layer management in `src/data/manager.js`
- Map stack switching in `src/mapStackController.js`
- Voice control in `src/voice/` (OpenAI Realtime over WebRTC)
- Voice map whiteboard annotations in `src/annotations/`
- 3D aircraft/model tracking surfaces in `src/data/flights.js` and `src/data/militaryFlights.js`
- Detection overlay and tracked-target readout in `src/data/detection.js`, `src/data/detectionDraw.js`, and `src/data/trackedReadout.js`
- Proxy middleware and API wiring in `vite.config.js`

### Active Data Layers in Runtime

Qualified Radio playback requests—category, station, country, coordinates, or
nearby place—always use station selection. Unqualified “turn on/start the radio”
requests use Play; a qualified Play-shaped tool call is normalized to Select so
its criteria cannot be silently ignored.

| Earthquakes | USGS — M2.5+, trailing 24 h, drawn as a 3D phenomenon since 2026-09-03. A POINT at the epicentre whose diameter is in CONSTANT SCREEN PIXELS and carries the MAGNITUDE (6 px at M2.5, +3 px per unit, frozen domain M2.5–M9.5); a vertical RULER rising from it whose length in world metres at 1:1 is the FOCAL DEPTH — declared in the legend as a READING SCALE and not the position of the focus, because both underground options were built and measured away (with `disableDepthTestDistance` the stem draws THROUGH the planet: parked at the antipode of the day's deepest event, 26 of 28 marks were phantoms from the far hemisphere; `scene.globe.translucency` took the WHOLE scene from 0.30 ms to 1.30–2.40 ms median and is a scene property no layer owns); and one COLOUR shared by point and ruler carrying the AGE inside the 24 h window on four frozen bands, re-banded at every 60 s poll and never per frame. **Since 2026-09-10 the key and the card split the job** (D1): the on-map key carries the colour ramp with its counts plus ONE line per shape channel publishing its frozen domain — measured in Chrome at 1440×900 on a 29-event feed, 827 px of content in a 216 px window became 215 px, and 31 lines / 375 words became 11 / 93 — while **clicking a mark, or its floating `M4.1` label, opens a card** carrying that event's magnitude, place, UTC instant + age, focal depth and USGS id, each next to the caveat that belongs to it (`×31,6` of energy per magnitude unit, no footprint, the ruler's direction, the 1 km floor). The click leaves a separate cyan RING rather than repainting the mark, because every channel of the mark is already a datum; Escape, a click on the world, a poll that ages the event out, and switching the layer off all take the card down | `src/data/earthquakes.js` | — | 60s |

| Marine Buoys ⬡ | NOAA NDBC — one ~106 KB text report carrying the latest observation from every reporting station worldwide. **NOAA is the operator, not the extent**: only about a fifth of reporting stations carry a wave sensor, and one without renders neutral rather than calm. Sea state coloured on the WMO ladder, AND carried a second time by a vertical stem in WORLD METRES: significant wave height at a ×10 000 reading scale published in the legend (1 m of swell = 10 km of stem), linear, floor 2 km, frozen domain 14 m — the top of the last NAMED band of the WMO ladder, so hue and height clip at the same place for the same published reason. The dot's pixel size no longer encodes anything (it was 9 px / 6 px for “has a sensor”); the SHAPE carries that now — filled disc = sensor, hollow grey ring = none — because a vertical stem has zero projected length at nadir and absence cannot rest on the stem alone. Stations are FIXED, so a poll replaces values in place and nothing interpolates | `src/data/marineBuoys.js`, `src/data/ndbcObservations.js` | `/api/ndbc` (keyless, disk cache, serve-stale) | 5 min |

Worldwide: every large and medium airport plus everything selling a scheduled seat; in France the whole long tail — 1,337 fields across métropole and outre-mer, altiports, hydrobases and one balloon field included. **Second publisher, second licence:** 418 French fields also carry the aerodrome boundary the IGN surveys in **BD TOPO® (Licence Ouverte 2.0, the Etalab Open License, attribution required)**, downloaded by the same build from `data.geopf.fr/wfs/ows` and joined on the ICAO code (377) or on the field's point falling inside an unkeyed outline (41) — 0 shared, 0 refused on the 5 km anchor guard, worst kept offset 1,382 m. **213 fields gain a shape they did not have**, 207 of them aéroclubs, which is the tier upstream georeferenced at 8 %. Drawn as one terrain-clamped wash for all 418 (a batched ground primitive colours by bounding rectangle) with its own 8 px screen floor, so the outline goes away between 24 km and 1,208 km depending on its size while the pastille keeps the tier's longer range; the anchor stays on the published reference point. Refused: héliports (704 of the IGN layer's 1,370 objects), anything under 1 ha (219, of which 205 are BD TOPO's 5.2 m placeholder square), and 30 outlines — 1,457 ha, mostly military, largest Lann Bihoué at 767 ha — that match no packed field | `src/data/localLayers.js`, `src/data/airportsPack.js` | — | static |

| Bornes IRVE 🇫🇷 🔌 | *fichier consolidé des bornes IRVE* (transport.data.gouv.fr, via ODRÉ) — 231,079 charge points measured 2026-08-27, rebuilt daily, folded to one site per coordinate. Three regimes by view span: 96 départements as EXTRUDED PRISMS (≥ 9.5° lat) — height = installed charge points on a frozen domain of 12 000 (≈ 15 % above the highest ever measured, 10 539 on 2026-08-27), colour = density on a frozen geometric ladder 100/250/500/1 000/2 500 per 1 000 km²; the old quantile bins are gone (six EQUAL intervals put 94 of 96 départements in one class, the geometric ladder gives 11·27·28·19·7·4). Four states, four marks: coloured prism, hatched prism (density not computable), filled flat footprint (measured zero), grid footprint (absent from the rollup) — then a **world-locked carroyage** (9.5°–0.35°): cells are squares of the graticule at a step frozen per zoom tier (0.25° / 0.0625° / 0.015625°, a quadtree, doubling itself if the occupied cells overflow the budget), one mark per occupied cell standing on a real site inside it and carrying the cell's COMPLETE charge-point total. Panning a France-wide view by 0.05° kept 179 of 1 100 marks under the old view-relative grid and keeps 1 050 of 1 057 now (G3). Every site with full detail (≤ 0.35°), where the BEAM height is the site's charge points (√, frozen domain of 24 = 98.1 % of sites, corrected for pitch, capped at −70°). The MARK is a tinted plate with Material's `bolt` punched out of it (`src/data/irveMarkIcons.js`), sized against an ink budget — `√(202 800 / marks)` clamped to 16–26 CSS px, so coverage stays flat at 15.6 % of a 1 440 × 900 frame from the ceiling down to the floor at 792 marks, and past that the answer is the power filter rather than a smaller plate. It replaced a 7 px disc that drew 318 marks nobody could find over Bordeaux at 12 653 m, the beam being a WORLD vertical whose shortest projection in that view was 1.1 px. Four rasters serve the whole fleet (the band colour rides on `billboard.color`). The POWER RAMP is monotonic in lightness and spends its whole order in the LIGHT half — L\* 54.1 → 63.3 → 72.3 → 81.7 → 90.9, gaps of 9.2 — because its first version ran from L\* 30.6 and a reader called those plates too dark to pick out: the two bottom rungs are 46 % of the sites in a French city, and a dark plate inside a dark casing is a dark blob whatever its hue. Composited over four control backdrops the smallest adjacent ΔE went 21.4 → 35.5, and the order still survives a simulated deuteranopia (40 → 46 → 52 → 68 → 93). `inconnue` is the HOLLOW plate, a rim with no fill, in the house refusal graphite at L\* 54.8 — the bottom of the ramp rather than the middle of it, so it is as findable as any measured band and what tells it apart is its SHAPE (D3); four power-floor chips `TOUT · > 22 · > 50 · > 150 kW` filter by the band ladder's own cuts (sites regime flips `filteredOut` and never rebuilds the collection, maillage re-picks in 1–12 ms). **Since 2026-09-14 the key answers ONE question — what does the colour mean** — and is one header plus the classes in view with their counts: measured in Chrome over a city view, 13 rows / 301 words / **717 px of content in a 355 px window** (clipped, its last sentence never on screen) became 7 rows / 46 words / **215 px in a 262 px window**, clipping nothing. What left it was true and is one click away: the beam's ruler (four ticks quoted in PIXELS) and its frozen domain of 24 are declared on the SITE CARD beside the exact figure they decode (F7 a, A5); the OPERATORS' clock is on that same card, per site and in French (`🗓 déclaré 15/11/2025 → 30/07/2026`), which is the stronger statement since a tenth of the register has not been touched since 2023; the publisher is named by `dataCredits.js` in the attribution surface; and the maillage cell's size in degrees and km is the first line of its own card. The key keeps only what nothing else says: the classes (D1), the refused one as a hollow ring (D3), the maillage's mark-to-site ratio and — only while a floor is hiding marks — one line saying how many and why slow classes survive it (A5). `inconnue` is labelled **_Puissance inconnue_ (Unknown power)** rather than *non exploitable* (unusable), which described what the value did to the parser rather than what the reader can know | `src/data/irveFrance.js`, `src/data/irveMarkIcons.js`, `src/data/irveFeed.js`, `src/data/irveDepartements.js`, `src/data/irveMesh.js` | `/api/irve-fr/sites`, `/api/irve-fr/departements`, `/api/irve-fr/mesh`, `/api/irve-fr/status` | 30 min (viewport TTL 6 h, national TTL 24 h; upstream consolidation is daily) |
| Établissements scolaires 🇫🇷 🎓 | *Annuaire de l'éducation* (data.education.gouv.fr, MENJ) — 68,939 rows measured 2026-09-01, rebuilt daily, of which 68,158 are open and geolocated over 68,083 distinct UAI. Pupil rolls joined on the UAI from four per-level *effectifs* datasets at rentrée 2025 (91.7% of teaching establishments). The DEPP's **IPS** joined on the same key from four more (`fr-en-ips-ecoles-ap2022` at rentrée 2024-2025, `-colleges-ap2023`, `-lycees-ap2023` and `-erea-ap2022` at 2025-2026 — each dataset discovers its OWN newest rentrée, floored; a global max drops all 32,494 écoles): 43,322 indexed UAI, reaching **40,529 of the 62,857 drawn schools that could carry an index (64.5%)**, with 2,504 `NS` sentinels and 348 indexed establishments this map does not draw. Three regimes by view span: 96 départements as EXTRUDED PRISMS (≥ 9.5° lat) — height = establishments on a frozen linear domain of 2 600 (measured range 150 Lozère → 2 504 Nord, median 577, spread 1:16.7), colour = density per 1 000 km² on frozen ×2 breaks 40/80/160/320/640 (measured class populations 8·34·30·14·4·6, none empty); a missing count is drawn STRIPED even when the rate exists, so it can never be the pixel-identical twin of a measured zero — then a grid-thinned maillage of real positions (9.5°–0.35°), every establishment with full detail (≤ 0.35°). Sites are coloured by level, sized by roll — the IPS changes NEITHER channel and there is no IPS colour scale, opt-in or otherwise; it is a card attribute and a coverage clause in the toggle readout. The maillage carries no IPS (it would undo the 1.66 MB-vs-5.42 MB name decision); a maillage click fetches the register for one coordinate and gets the same card the exact regime draws. 2,762 overseas schools are outside the bundled metropolitan polygons and are reported rather than painted | `src/data/schoolsFrance.js`, `src/data/schoolsFeed.js`, `src/data/schoolsDepartements.js`, `src/data/schoolsMesh.js`, `src/data/ipsFeed.js` | `/api/schools-fr/sites`, `/api/schools-fr/departements`, `/api/schools-fr/mesh`, `/api/schools-fr/status` | 30 min (viewport TTL 6 h, national TTL 24 h; IPS index built once per process — 8 requests, 7.6 MB raw / 750 KB gz, 3.4 s cold; upstream register rebuild is daily, IPS annual) |
| Enseignement supérieur 🇫🇷 🏛 | *Effectifs d'étudiants inscrits — détail par établissements* (data.enseignementsup-recherche.gouv.fr, MESR) — 22,068 rows at rentrée 2024, resolved to **6,294 establishments and 6,914 sites** holding 2,960,012 students. The rentrée and the Parcoursup session are DISCOVERED at build time and floored at 2024/2026. 1,665 establishments carry no `geo`; 977 are placed from *Cartographie des formations Parcoursup* (session 2026) where it gives exactly one point for the UAI, which also supplies 5,705 establishment names and the per-card formation lists — a borrowed coordinate is flagged on its card, and the 688 neither file places are reported. **Two regimes, not three**: 96 départements as EXTRUDED PRISMS over STUDENTS (≥ 9.5° lat) — height on a SQUARE-ROOT scale (declared: the domain is 738 Corse-du-Sud → 394 788 Paris, i.e. 1:535, and a linear rule would crush 51 of the 96 départements onto the 4 km floor, median included), frozen domain 400 000 students, colour = share of students at bac+4 and beyond. Density was REFUSED as the colour on measurement: Spearman ρ 0.974 against the count, so the hue would have repeated the height — then every site in view drawn straight from the national pack — no bbox query, no ceiling and no thinning, because the pack is 6,914 sites and 0.62 MB gzipped with every name on it. Coloured by seven bands folded from the register's 14 categories, sized by the enrolment at that site; 214 overseas sites are outside the bundled metropolitan polygons and are reported rather than painted | `src/data/supFrance.js`, `src/data/supFeed.js`, `src/data/supDepartements.js` | `/api/sup-fr/sites`, `/api/sup-fr/departements`, `/api/sup-fr/status` | 6 h (proxy TTL 7 d, serve-stale 30 d; the register is published once a year at the rentrée) |

The week is DISCOVERED from `max(t_1h)` and floored at 2026-08-24; the feed is a nightly batch landing ~46 h behind the wall clock and is never presented as live. Live build 2026-09-02: 1,730 arcs counting vehicles, 356 occupancy-only, **891 silent** (724 *Invalide* (invalid), 141 *Ouvert* (open), 26 *Barré* (closed)), 31 with no published geometry of which 19 are measuring. Geometry and street names come from the measurement export, NOT from `referentiel-comptages-routiers` (3,739 rows for 3,348 distinct arcs). **Bivariate since 2026-09-03**: hue = the SHAPE OF THE RHYTHM computed over the 168 hours (*nocturne* night 56 · *week-end* weekend 100 · *pendulaire* commuter 367 · *pointe du matin* morning peak 150 · *pointe du soir* evening peak 652 · *continu* continuous 369 · *indéterminé* undetermined 36 — measured on the real pack, no empty class), width = flow, plus an hour cursor of 48 slots transposed from `idfm-frequency`. The four rhythm thresholds are round frozen numbers, never quantiles of the week (C1). No green anywhere in the wheel, on purpose: a traffic-light reading needs green, so the amber *pointe du soir* (evening peak) cannot be read as congestion. The cursor rebuilds NO vertices — geometry is built once per width band and the cursor only writes `show` (G2); 6 287 instances in 8 draw calls, bounded by `comptagesReachableBands()` at 58.1 % of the cartesian product. Default stays *Moyenne ouvrée* (Weekday average), not *À cette heure* (At this hour), because the chips are not serialised into the share link.

| Délinquance enregistrée 🇫🇷 🚓 | *Bases statistiques de la délinquance enregistrée* (SSMSI, via data.gouv.fr, LO 2.0, edition 2026-07-09) — DEP table (101 départements × 18 indicators × 2016–2025) plus the COM table streamed from a 39.9 MB gzip (**5,238,000 rows → 34,920 communes**, folded to the newest year, 8.8 s cold). Two regimes: a département choropleth on published rates, then per-département commune packs joined to geo.api.gouv.fr contours. **Suppression is the layer**: 0 suppressed cells at département grain, 9.0%–69.8% at commune grain depending on indicator. A withheld cell arrives as `[state]` with no number, is excluded from every quantile, and has its own colour. Quantile thresholds are cut ONCE nationally and shared by every pack. The layer OPENS on a computed all-offences total (`tous`) — GEV's arithmetic, not the register's, which publishes no total: 14 commune-grain contributors and 16 at département grain, the two `Usage de stupéfiants` sub-indicators dropped because the parent equals AFD + hors AFD in 101 of 101 départements, and the rate recomputed on `insee_pop` because published rates sit on two denominators. Exact at département grain, a stated **minorant** at commune grain (2025: 9,606 communes positive of which 9,428 are floors, 243 complete zeros, 25,071 with nothing publishable). 45 SSMSI codes have no contour (Paris 20, Marseille 16, Lyon 9 arrondissements) and are reported as `unshaped`. Cards come in two registers: compact by default — one line per claim, ≤ 60 characters, so nothing wraps — and the SSMSI's rules word for word behind a `Méthodo` chip that redraws the card already open | `src/data/delinquanceFrance.js`, `src/data/delinquanceFeed.js`, `src/data/delinquanceDepartements.js` | `/api/delinquance-fr/departements`, `/api/delinquance-fr/communes/:dep`, `/api/delinquance-fr/status` | 24 h (proxy TTL 24 h, serve-stale 120 d; the base is republished about once a year) |

Two regimes: **mesh** (72,700 tuples `[lat, lon, opérateurs, bande]`, 394 KB gz, thinned to 1,100–2,200 points; a whole-France view holds 68,878 supports and 305 occupied cells, selected in 15.3 ms) and **supports** under 0.32° of span (box ≤ 0.35°, the densest in France = 6,462 supports = 113 KB gz). Color = the generation that TRANSMITS (5G 50,148 · 4G 18,698 · 3G 127 · 2G 89); size = number of operators (1→36,671, 4→11,012, 5→1); **height = the shaft, in world units, at the support's real height** — coverage measured at 99.24% (72,149 of 72,700; median 30 m, p95 48 m, max 343.3 m), and the 551 with no height get NO shaft because they are exactly the 506 *intérieur sous-terrain* (indoor underground) + 38 *tunnel* + 7 *galerie* (gallery): ANFR leaves the field empty because there is no mast to measure. A support where nothing transmits gets a DASHED shaft (a height declared on an authorized application, not the measurement of a built object). **Azimuths** come out as 60 m rays, on the selected support's card only: the observatory publishes none (CSV header reread live, 22 columns) and Cartoradio gives 98.8% of them. Pale ring = approved project (3,638 with no transmission at all, 3,776 real extensions out of 15,606 applications). NOT painted: no departmental choropleth (the bundled polygons are mainland-only and would hide the overseas gap — 1.0% 5G in Nouvelle-Calédonie against 84.1% in the Val-d'Oise); no civil aviation, Defense or Interior sites (excluded by law); no FH/TNT/PMR (microwave links, digital terrestrial TV, private mobile radio: named on the card, never drawn); no exposure value per antenna — the closest measurement is that of a PLACE, with its distance and its date. | src/data/anfrFeed.js, src/data/anfrMesh.js, src/data/anfrFrance.js | /api/anfr-fr/mesh, /api/anfr-fr/supports, /api/anfr-fr/support/:id, /api/anfr-fr/status | poll 6 h; proxy TTL 6 h, serve-stale 14 d, disk cache 5.2 MB; Cartoradio card 24 h; weekly upstream (cold build 36.4 s / 517 MB) |

The tree chip gates the REQUEST, not just the paint. Green-space fills are coloured by `indice_veget_sup8m_2024` on TWO fixed bands cut at a quarter of the ground (401 under, 582 over; the 66 at exactly 0 are inside the low band and named in its blurb, the 1 with no index at all is grey and reported in the key's note rather than given a row); the **23** spaces declaring `canicule_ouverture = "Oui"` carry a hot ground stroke, 9 of them also `ouvert_24h`, 11 of them with zero measured canopy. Equipment dots are coloured by THREE mechanisms folded from the 12 published types — you go in (225), you stand under something (156), there is water (154) — with the published `type` kept verbatim on every card; fountains by `dispo` (1 238 OUI / 85 NON, 10 of the NON past their own end date); trees by whether a height was published at all (19 407 are 0) and sized by it, capped at 25 m. Every dot is seated on the surface being DRAWN (`provisionalFloor.js` under the DEM warm, with a doubling retry) rather than on the ellipsoid, which is what stops the whole layer sliding across the city as the camera moves. Open/closed is re-folded in the browser on Europe/Paris every minute (757 spaces open at 14 h vs 367 at 01 h 30, 5,0 ms per re-fold) rather than taken from the proxy's hour-old summary. NOT painted: nothing — all 535 equipment rows, all 1 323 fountains and all 219 432 trees carry a real coordinate, and 984 of 984 spaces keep at least one ring (22 of 3 439 rings fall below a triangle at 1 m and are dropped and counted) | `src/data/fraicheurParis.js`, `src/data/fraicheurFeed.js`, `src/data/fraicheurTrees.js` | `/api/fraicheur-fr/refuges`, `/api/fraicheur-fr/arbres`, `/api/fraicheur-fr/status` | 60 min for the pack + a local re-fold of the clock every minute (proxy TTL 60 min, serve-stale 7 d; the equipment and fountain registers are rebuilt daily).

| Autorisations d'urbanisme 🇫🇷 🏗 | Sitadel via DiDo — *liste des autorisations d'urbanisme créant des logements* (rid `8b35affb…`, 1 917 260 rows, millésime 2026-08) and *liste des permis de démolir* (rid `1a9a2f0c…`, 202 895 rows, from 1996), both keyless and `fr-lo`, PLUS `cadastre.data.gouv.fr` Etalab parcels (edition discovered from the `latest` 302, floored at 2026-06-01) and `geo.api.gouv.fr/communes` for the commune under the screen centre. **ONE regime, and the arithmetic forbids a second**: DiDo scans an 889 MB CSV in 3,57–5,01 s per query whatever the query, so 34 945 communes is 39 h for one national pass — the layer answers one commune at a time and names it on the row. The file publishes NO coordinate (`geoFields: ["REG","DEP"]`); every position is a cadastral-reference join, refused when the reference matches more than one parcel. Ground-clamped `GroundPrimitive` fills, one per parcel part, coloured by the lifecycle band of the MOST RECENT permit on that plot (`Autorisé` / `Chantier ouvert` / `Travaux achevés` / `Annulé` / demolition), a `GroundPolylinePrimitive` edge per ring, a `PointPrimitiveCollection` dot per placed permit sized by `NB_LGT_TOT_CREES` (√, ceiling 200), **a 12 m-square COLUMN per dossier, one metre per authorised dwelling, linear, ceiling 200 m** — a height is a length and reads directly, so the square root that is right for a disc's AREA is wrong here; the unit is chosen so the column reads against the city it stands in (a Nantes block is 10–30 m of BD TOPO volume). **Until 2026-09-14 the PARCEL ITSELF was extruded, and that multiplied the dwelling count by the size of the plot**: measured over the parcels actually extruded, base p50 403 m² / max 40 400 m² (Paris), p50 395 m² / max 153 173 m² (Nantes, 388× the median), p50 637 m² / max 24 955 m² (Ustaritz), largest single mark 25 426 754 m³ for one file — and the height was drawn once per parcel, so a dossier naming three plots claimed its dwellings three times (×1.87 Ustaritz, ×1.73 Nantes, ×1.30 Paris). The reported case was Ustaritz 06454721B0037, 45 logements over three adjoining parcels = 404 000 m³ of opaque orange over a village of 8 m houses, for a file whose `SURFACE_PLANCHER_CREEE` is 3 308 m². The fixed base makes volume proportional to the count and nothing else (total drawn volume ÷20 to ÷28 by commune) and the parcel keeps the ground: its wash, its edge, its card. The columns are NOT `GroundPrimitive`, carry no `classificationType` and are draped on nothing: opaque geometry depth-tested against the Google mesh, so it occludes them instead of being painted over (F1a/F4). The floor is read at the PERMIT's anchor, where its dot already stands, so one dossier has one floor for both marks; a cold ground cell leaves the dossier with NO column, counted and re-asked, never extruded from the ellipsoid. **Every mark reads ONE floor** (`sitadelFloorM`, 2026-09-14): the shared DEM cell when it is warm, a `provisionalFloor.js` probe of the surface actually being DRAWN while it is not, and `null` — never `0` — when neither answers. Before that the dots took `0` for a cold cell and were never written again: measured over Paris, camera at 500 m, **all 4 753 sat at ellipsoidal height 1.0 m while the drawn mesh under them read 76.7–96.9 m**, and because they paint through depth their screen position followed the camera pose and the layer slid across the rooftops. `reanchorPoints` now re-seats the dots already on screen when a better floor lands, on a doubling ladder refilled at every camera settle, and a floor that stops answering never overwrites one that did. A floor outside **−100 m to 5 000 m** is refused as not-French-ground and re-probed on every later pass rather than latched: measured over Nantes with the tileset reporting `tilesLoaded: true`, 81 probes on a 1,3 km grid ALL answered between −424.9 m and −360.2 m in a smooth 5 % ramp (a planet-scale root tile answering for a city), every one passed `provisionalFloor.js`'s world band, and the fill radius lent one of them to the whole commune. Proven by `npm run qa:sitadel-floor`, which refuses `/api/terrain/heights` so the claim is about the DRAWN surface and not about a network round trip. A permit with no published dwelling count is not drawn at zero height: it keeps its clickable ground fill, edged in ITS OWN band colour instead of the neutral — a sign that survives a nadir camera, where a column and a fill look alike. Selecting a dossier rings the GROUND of every plot it names — it had to climb to the roof only while the plot itself was the opaque volume. And the commune contour as a second polyline — the scope of the answer, decimated (Nantes 804 → 269 vertices, worst displacement 183 m) and labelled *contour communal simplifié* (“simplified municipal outline”). Measured: Paris 4 500 parcels / 70 766 vertices / 4 753 dots, Nantes 3 032 / 47 676 / 2 747. NOT painted and COUNTED instead: 9 449 ambiguous, 1 859 missing and 219 reference-less permits over the six measured communes — never moved to a commune centre, and never given a legend swatch, because the swatch is the colour the object is painted | `src/data/sitadelFrance.js`, `src/data/sitadelFeed.js` | `/api/sitadel-fr/commune`, `/api/sitadel-fr/status` | camera-driven (450 ms debounce, gated on camera ALTITUDE ≤ 12 000 m — 2·h·tan 30° = 13,86 km of ground at Cesium's default 60° FOV, against communes 12,1–17,9 km wide — asking once per 0,01° focus cell and carrying `have=<insee>` so an unchanged commune answers in 53 B instead of 2 085 535 B) + 6 h idle; proxy TTL 24 h memory + `.gev-cache/sitadel-fr/communes/`, serve-stale 30 d, global DiDo semaphore of 2 because the 4th simultaneous request is a 429 |
| Réseau et fréquence IDFM 🇫🇷 Ⓜ | ONE row over TWO Île-de-France Mobilités publications, merged 2026-09-10 — they drew the same stops and the reader was left to do the join. **The referential** (`arrets`, `referentiel-des-lignes`, ODbL 1.0): 37,956 stops and 2,121 lines with their official liveries, drawn below 20 km of altitude as **filled mode badges, 21–27 px** (a pictogram knocked into a disc), at most 100 per 1° box, seated on the terrain under them. The badge replaced naked 14–24 px line-art on 2026-09-10: tinted `#c9d4e0` for the mode this referential is mostly made of, it was pale grey line-art on pale grey roofs, and a filled mark brings its own ground instead of hoping for a luckier hue. IDFM publishes NO GTFS-Realtime vehicle positions at all (0 in Paris intra-muros against 453 in Bordeaux), so this layer draws the offer and never fakes a vehicle. **The hourly offer** (*Offre hebdomadaire moyenne hors vacances*, Licence Ouverte v2.0) — **1,311,578 rows, 22 fields**, edition `data_processed` 2026-08-18T15:54:55+00:00 discovered from the portal and floored there. **The only time-of-day dimension in the app**: average departures per stop for a 7 × 24 (day, band) grid, operating day 04:00→03:59 so bands run 4..27. It draws below a 0.035° view span (leaves at 0.045°) as a small rate disc — **but never on a stop the referential already badges**: one point carries one mark since 2026-09-10, and the badge carries the rate in its FILL, so mode is the shape and rate is the colour. Five upstream calls per box — one identity page plus four band windows, because `offset + limit <= 20000` caps grouped reads and the band axis cannot be pivoted — **3,303,162 bytes in 2.42 s → 540,404 raw / 87,143 gzipped for 805 stops** on a 4 km box on Châtelet. Fixed six-step ladder (2/4/8/16/32 departures per hour), never a quantile, so a colour means the same wait in Paris at 08:00 and in Melun at 01:00; on an average Tuesday that box splits 23/6/17/167/240/237/115 at 08:00 and 397/179/80/103/44/2/0 at 01:00. **The join is `arrets.arrid`** — measured 2026-09-02, 34,903 of the offer's 36,502 stops (95.6 %) join it — and one click prints both halves on one card: mode, arrondissement, fare zone and step-free status, then the rate for the selected band, the day's sparkline, first/peak/last, the day total and the same band across all seven days. **No licence line on the card since 2026-09-10** — both licences are named by `dataCredits.js` in the attribution surface for as long as the row is on, and a card a reader opens to find out what serves their street is not an attribution surface. NOT claimed: a referential stop outside the offer file (**3,053 of 37,956, 8.0 %**) says so instead of showing a zero; **a click above the frequency gate BUYS the profile it cannot draw** — the card carried *offre horaire non lue à cette altitude* (“timetable not read at this altitude”) until 2026-09-10 and a box the proxy had refused as too dense answered a click with a flat *aucun profil publié* (“no published profile”), which was not merely unhelpful but false; a click names one coordinate and the cheapest legal box around one coordinate is one 0.005° cell, so the gate now bounds the DRAWING and never the answer, and every profile that box paid for is kept so the next click on the street is free; the **549 stops (1.50 %) with no coordinate** (473 Train, 69 Bus, 7 Tramway; 2.76 % of a Tuesday's courses) are counted and never placed; a box past the 1,200-stop ceiling is refused after one call with `tooDense` and an *au moins* (“at least”) count; and no stop is drawn for a `stop_times.txt` this layer never opens. **The legend follows the fills**: in a charted view it is the six-rung ramp plus the measured-silence row plus a `#8a93a6` *offre horaire non publiée* (“timetable not published”) row; above the gate, or in a refused box, it is the MODES on screen with their counts — until 2026-09-10 it was six rungs at zero and a silent row at zero, a legend describing nothing that was drawn. **Dropped in the merge**: the eight-département choropleth the frequency row painted above its gate. A choropleth needs an alpha low enough for the imagery underneath to survive, and at that altitude the result read as a faint wash over half of France rather than as a reading.

| Bruit des aéroports 🇫🇷 🔊 | *DGAC Plan d'Exposition au Bruit* and *Plan de Gêne Sonore* via Géoplateforme WMS-V `GetFeatureInfo` (`INFO_FORMAT=application/json`, real EPSG:4326 MultiPolygon), plus the `dgac_peb_arrete_wfs` register (224 points, 66 355 B, `numberMatched` 224) cached to `.gev-cache/bruit-fr/`. Keyless, CORS `*`, `<Fees>none</Fees>` + cartes.gouv.fr CGU. **TWO regimes on one route, camera-anchored, on the shared `createAddressScanLayer` shell.** Below 12 000 m, POINT MODE: two probes at the ground point the camera looks at, **scale PINNED at 1e-4°/pixel = 1:39 757** and never derived from the camera, because `dgac_peb_plan_wmsv` stops rendering below ~1:25 000 and then answers HTTP 200 with a 137-byte empty FeatureCollection. Between 12 000 m and 250 000 m, OVERVIEW MODE: the layer adds `km=` to the same request and the proxy answers about the AERODROMES in view instead — one probe each at their own published reference points, at **1e-2°/pixel = 1:3 975 696**, whose GetFeatureInfo buffer is wide enough to return a whole plan rather than the one band the reference point sits in. A PEB is nested rings, so at the fine scale a probe returns zone A and nothing else; measured over 25 aerodromes, 37 distinct bands at 1e-4 against **88 at 1e-2**, and Roissy's zone D and Toussus's zone B return at no finer scale. **That coarse scale is then paid back by a SECOND PASS**, because the same number that widens the `GetFeatureInfo` buffer is what GeoServer generalises the outline to — measured, Roissy's zone C returns 381 vertices at 1:39 757 and 22 at 1:3 975 696, its zone D 664 against 37, so a 65,8 km ring drew with visible facets. The overview probe is therefore demoted to a DISCOVERY pass that only names the bands, and each named band is re-fetched at the probe scale aimed at its own coarse outline — which works because the service does not clip the geometry it returns to the box it was asked through. Seeds are `BRUIT_REFINE_SEEDS` = 6 points spread around the band's own biggest outer ring, each pulled 2 % toward that ring's centroid: measured 2026-09-07 over two disjoint 25-aerodrome slices, **170 of 170 bands recovered**, candidates needed 1→149 2→3 3→9 4→1, 209 fine probes for 170 bands. **That second pass has TWO tempos, and 30 000 m is the boundary.** Above it, it is a BACKGROUND pass — measured cold, the twelve aerodromes around Paris cost 12 probes and ~1,5 s coarse against 85 probes and ~9,5 s refined, so the coarse answer is served at once and the fine geometry lands in the per-aerodrome cache behind it; the refiner yields to any foreground scan rather than competing for the three-concurrent budget. **Below 30 000 m the layer adds `fine=1` and the proxy plays that pass in FRONT of the answer**, nearest aerodrome first, so the frame a reader dezooms to in order to see one airport's plan (≈42 km across at that altitude) is at 1:39 757 on its first paint instead of arriving faceted and redrawing seconds later. The point ceiling is deliberately NOT what moved: a point probe owes its sharpness to an 11 m buffer, and that buffer is exactly why it returns one ring of four — extending POINT MODE to 30 km would have bought a sharp outline by dropping zones B, C and D. The wait is bounded by `BRUIT_FINE_FOREGROUND_BUDGET_MS` = **4 000 ms**, floored by the ~0,8 s one aerodrome costs cold (so the centred aerodrome is always fine on the first paint) and capped under the layer's own 5 s refine poll (so a truncated pass never stacks with the poll behind it); whatever the budget does not reach stays coarse, says so, and is handed back to the background worker. It bounds the SECOND PASS and not the request — the discovery probes run first and are not on that clock. Measured 2026-09-10 at Roissy, radius 25 km, 18 aerodromes and 72 bands, from an empty `zones.json`: **no `fine` 2,66 s and 0 of 72 bands fine; `fine=1` 6,64 s and 27 of 72 fine on the FIRST payload; `fine=1` 0,08 s and 72 of 72 once the background pass has landed** — and on that first fine payload LFPG's own four zones return at 110 / 247 / 381 / 664 vertices, the probe scale's numbers, on the aerodrome the camera is centred on. The foreground pass holds the same gate the refiner yields to, so it never turns three concurrent upstream calls into five, and a pass the BUDGET cut short does not stamp `triedAt` — stamping it would freeze the half-refined plan of the airport under the camera for the 10 min cooldown. The proxy grants `fine` only at the first rung of the radius ladder (≤ 25 km), because at a 50 km radius the screen is ~140 km across, the median band is 1,9 km wide, and 37 vertices against 381 is under a pixel for the same four seconds. Measured end to end over a 100 km radius on Paris: **1 399 vertices at t=0, 9 177 at t+15 s, 12 045 and 94/94 bands refined at t+45 s** — ×8,6. The payload carries `refining` — aerodromes whose pass is queued NOW, not merely coarse, so the count reaches zero and the polling stops even where a band could not be refined at all; an aerodrome whose pass came up short is left alone for 10 min rather than re-probed on every scan. `scheduleBruitRefinePoll` re-asks every 5 s through the shell's new `rescan` hook (the layer's answer improves while its question does not, which neither of the shell's own refetch triggers can see), giving up after 6 polls with no progress because a coarse overview is still complete. **The card never overclaims**: every band carries the scale its own outline was fetched at, a payload reports the COARSEST of them plus `refinedBands`/`coarseBands`, and a mixed draw prints the coarse figure and names how many bands are already better. **The card is written for a reader, not for a cartographer**: the scale is stated as the ground size of one service pixel (*tracé à ~11 m près*, “drawn to within ~11 m”, ~1,1 km in overview) rather than as “1:39 757”; a zone leads with what it means for the ground (*gêne très forte : logements neufs interdits*, “very strong nuisance: new housing forbidden”) and the threshold follows as its evidence; the innermost ring, which the register publishes with its two thresholds equal, prints *70 dB(A) et plus* (“70 dB(A) and above”) rather than a bare “70”; and no card carries the arrêté's PDF URL, because the overlay is a canvas with `interactive: false` where a link is eighty unselectable characters costing two of six rows — the document is named by `arrêté préfectoral du <date> · <OACI>`, which is what the filename is built from. Up to **24 aerodromes** (a complete map to a 75 km radius over Paris, the densest ground in the register), selected nearest-centre-first with a 35 km reach past the radius because a plan is drawn around a point that can be off screen; what the budget drops is counted and said. Overview bands carry `atPoint: false` because nothing was tested against a point, so there is no winner, no runner-up and no dash — the most exposed band of each aerodrome simply takes the strongest wash. Above 250 000 m the layer is dormant with a `zoom-in` GUIDANCE status (never an error). **Every band's interior answers a click** through the shell's `groundCard` hook, re-tested point-in-polygon against the drawn rings and holes: the wash is a polygon, a polygon entity has no position, and without it only the outlines were clickable — measured, a pick on the aerodrome marker's own pixel returns the wash beneath it. `scripts/qa-bruit-overview.mjs` proves the whole boundary in a real scene: one band at 6 km, four at 60 km with no dash among 318 rings and 18 aerodromes drawn at once, a click on a wash opening its band's card, dormancy at 400 km, and the card's printed denominator matching the payload's in whichever refinement state the cache is in. Measured 2026-09-02 over one probe at each of the 224 aerodromes: 215 answer, 9 do not (LFPN/LFPK/LFPT answer at no scale at all), 298 zone rows, features per probe 0→9 1→141 2→67 3→5 4→2, heaviest response 15 041 B / 742 vertices at Le Bourget, whole sweep 473 193 B / 15 619 vertices, so nothing is decimated. Bands are coloured by zone letter (PEB A `#ff2d55` / B `#ff7a1f` / C `#ffcc33` / D `#9fd0ff`; PGS I/II/III on a separate violet family so the two documents never read as one scale), filled as hole-cut ground classification with a stroke on every ring including the interior ones, and painted quietest-last because two classification washes blend. **The winner is chosen deliberately and named on the card**: only a band containing the point is eligible, then the most exposed zone, then the newest effective arrêté, then the ICAO code, then the feature id — and the card prints *2 zones ici, retenue : la plus exposée* (“2 zones here, kept: the most exposed”) plus the runner-up's own band. Alphas are BORROWED from `urbanismeGpu.js`'s measured ladder (0,42 winner / 0,30 also-inside / 0,22 beside), not re-measured, and the imported ceiling is enforced at the draw. NOT painted: any non-aviation noise — there is no CBS on the Géoplateforme (915 layer names, 4 mention bruit) and the per-DDT Géo-IDE archives have no CORS (**re-measured 2026-09-08, and the CORS half is no longer the blocker**: these layers would come through a server proxy, where CORS does not apply. What blocks is the format and the weight — 155 CBS datasets on data.gouv.fr, published per DDT / département / infrastructure / period, four organisations across the first 50 results, WFS advertising **GML only** with `OUTPUTFORMAT=application/json` answering 500-wrapping-400, and `COUNT=1` on Côte-d'Or's rail-noise layer returning **1 080 625 bytes for one band**. So it is a GML parser and a per-DDT collection chantier, not this layer's WMS `GetFeatureInfo` pattern, and national coverage does not exist yet); no PSA (that is obstacle height, not noise); no Bruitparif (licence).

An overview still carrying `refining > 0` is cached for **3 s instead of 6 h** and served `Cache-Control: no-store`, because a provisional answer that outlived the refinement it is waiting for would pin the facets for the rest of the day. **The header was the bug that nearly shipped**: the shared route answered every address scan `private, max-age=300`, so measured in a real browser the layer's five-second poll was served entirely from the HTTP cache, not one request reached the server, and the draw stayed at 72 coarse bands for a whole session while the proxy finished all 18 aerodromes in 20 s. `addressCacheControl` now derives the header from the same shelf life as the server cache — `no-store` under a minute, the historical five minutes above it, capped at the server's own TTL.

An INDICATOR, not a register: no national list of crèches is published as open data (the measurement is in `petiteEnfanceFeed.js`). **Two regimes, both TERRITORIES — no point anywhere**: 96 département polygons joined by CODE (verified exact — the opposite of the Annuaire, which zero-pads) down to a 0,9° lat span, then the EPCI and commune territories themselves, filled from geo.api.gouv.fr commune contours served by view box. An EPCI has no published contour and is drawn as its member communes under one colour with no internal outline (`codeEpci` rides along with the geometry); below 0,45° the 1 061 published communes are CUT OUT of that wash and filled with their own rate, so no ground carries two numbers. Paris/Lyon/Marseille need a second `type=arrondissement-municipal` request and the arrondissement replaces its parent commune outright. Colour is a RATIO to the national rate (60,9), not a quantile, so it means the same at all three scales; there is no size channel any more and the places count is on the card. Fills are batched one primitive per band colour and the selection is its own pair — a batched `GroundPrimitive` colours by bounding RECTANGLE.

In both close regimes a practice is a tinted plate with its FAMILY of medicine punched out of it (`medecinFamilyIcons.js`: Maki's stethoscope and cross, Temaki's trefoil, Material's adult-and-child, head and scalpel), sized by DISTINCT doctors and riding a distance ramp back down to a coloured speck at mesh altitude. Every mark stands on the GROUND under it — the shared DEM/mesh cell, a rendered-surface probe while that is cold — and is re-placed when a better floor lands: the ellipsoid is 220 m under Lyon and projected 171 px from the street at the median.

BOTH prisms rise: a downward one is verifiably unimplementable (`Globe.translucency.enabled` is false by default and is a SCENE property no layer owns; on the photoreal stack the globe is hidden anyway), and a signed bar chart only works because its zero line is straight — here the datum is a sphere.

| Bâti 3D 🇫🇷 ▤ | IGN BD TOPO® `batiment`, Géoplateforme vector tiles at z15, per viewport — extruded volumes coloured by `usage_1`, seated on their own NGF-IGN69 altitudes (h = H + N), re-anchored by a per-~1.1 km-cell median of the rendered surface measured UNDER EACH BUILDING (`globe.getHeight`), each volume then reaching down to the lowest ground under its footprint. **Since 2026-09-03 it is also the thematic support for the address layers** (`src/data/buildingTheme.js`): a layer registers a theme, the volumes are painted by it, and this layer's legend and stats are replaced by the theme's ramp. Precedence 10 `dpe-fr` < 20 `dvf-sales` < 30 `ads-fr`; smallest footprint wins a point that falls in several; ties broken by id, so tile order can never move a diagnostic from one volume to another. A PAINTED volume takes the theme colour FLAT — the height shading is switched off, otherwise a tall D and a short C land on the same pixel value; an UNJOINED volume keeps the height shading on a WASHED version of its usage tint (s×0.15 / l×0.42 in HSL, ΔE76 ≥ 36.5 against all three target palettes) so it is graphically distinguishable rather than merely absent (A1). Two separate A5 counters travel with the paint: points geocoded but on no loaded footprint, and points with no coordinate at all — `Number(null)` being 0, an empty-longitude row would otherwise sail off Ghana and be counted as “missed a building”.

| Pouls vélo 🇫🇷 ◷ | A typical week of cycling in Lyon and Paris, bundled as `local_data/velo_pulse/pulse.json` — 168 numbers per site, averaged over four weeks of June 2026, read in LOCAL wall-clock hours in both cities. **Two instruments, never one scale**: Lyon is Vélo'v dock occupancy (a STOCK, 450 stations) because the Métropole publishes an availability archive since 2023-03-27; Paris is permanent bike counters (a FLOW, 111 sites) because **no Vélib' availability archive exists anywhere public**. Drawn as a **field of soft ground-clamped blobs, one per station** — a proportional symbol, not a kernel-density heatmap, which is what leaves each station clickable (CARTOGRAPHY G4) — and no longer as 561 extruded squares. Colour is the site's share of its OWN weekly maximum on a five-band ramp **monotone in CIE L\*** and warm at the busy end (93 · 80 · 63 · 45 · 27 — pale where a station is idle, deep carmine at its weekly maximum; ≥ 6.3 L\* apart composited over the backdrops it lands on, ΔE 24 from the map at the busy end and ΔE 19 from the two other magnitude ramps drawn over the same streets; `veloPulseRamp.test.mjs` recomputes the chain — alpha included, read out of `veloPulse.js` — and fails on any inversion, any band that stops separating, and a busiest band that stops being visible), interpolated between the bands; the blob's AREA is the absolute quantity in that city's own unit, **sized in metres with no distance inflation** (B2), so it fades out between 40 and 90 km rather than pretending to be readable — Cesium's fade works on SQUARED distances with a pow(t, 0.2) curve, which puts it at 42 % opacity by 45 km, so that is where the panel and the row say *descendez sous 45 km* (“go below 45 km”, F6). Fill alpha is a flat **0.45** — it stopped being a second encoding of the value (A3), and the basemap keeps 55 % of itself under every blob. Three modes — the current hour of the week, the 168-hour animation, and the network's busiest hour — plus a **panel under the globe** (`veloPulseHud.js`) carrying the hour in words, what the network is doing at it, the week as a 168-bar strip that is also the transport (click/drag/arrows to scrub, which pauses), and the clicked site's fiche with its own week in the map's colours. The panel is **draggable** anywhere in the viewport and remembers where it was left (`src/panelDrag.js`, shared with `ui.js`); double-clicking its header brings it home | `src/data/veloPulse.js`, `src/data/veloPulseFeed.js`, `src/data/veloPulseHud.js`, `src/panelDrag.js` | — (bundled; `npm run velo:pulse` rebuilds) | static; the animation eases between the hours at 520 ms per hour, a whole week in about 87 s |
| Carroyage INSEE 🇫🇷 ▩ | **Four regimes on one row.** Above a 12° box: one screen-space disc per **RÉGION**; from 12° down to the grid's 0.9° ceiling: one per **DÉPARTEMENT** — both from INSEE's **Melodi** API (`DS_FILOSOFI_CC` 2023 + `DS_POPULATIONS_REFERENCE` 2023 + `DS_BTS_SAL_EQTP_SEX_AGE` 2024, keyless, 97 codes in one URL, month-long proxy cache), anchored on a bundled 16.8 KB point pack (`france_territoires/territoires.json`, built from the IGN outlines + API Géo). Six indicators there, two of which the grid cannot compute at all (Gini, D9/D1), on their own measured bands — the grid's ramp spans 15 300–32 400 € and every département sits inside a 10 000 € window, so borrowing it would paint the country in two bands. It is a DIFFERENT dataset and every card says so: a median where the grid has a mean, people where it has households, 2023 where the relay is 2019. The layer therefore has **no `ensureViewGate`** — it no longer needs the camera moved for it. Below 0.9°: INSEE *Filosofi* gridded income and population — **from a local 2021 pack when one is built (`npm run filosofi:pack-2021`), otherwise the Géoplateforme WFS relay, which is still on 2019**. The millésime travels with every answer and is printed on every card, never assumed: INSEE published 2021 on 2026-02-12 and the relay has not moved (2 314 836 cells served against 2 324 577 documented for 2021). The pack holds **2 324 577 cells — INSEE's published total for 2021 exactly** — across all three grids INSEE publishes on: métropole `CRS3035`, Martinique `CRS5490`, La Réunion `CRS2975`. Reading those two took adding an inverse UTM alongside the LAEA one, and fixed a bug the layer had shipped with: **both overseas départements were declared as coverage and drew nothing**, because `parseCellId` accepted `CRS3035` alone — a Réunion box matched 2 502 cells and drew 0. The inverse is checked against the WFS's own geometry: 0.78 mm worst error over La Réunion, 0.50 mm over Martinique. Relayed as WFS by the Géoplateforme — **2,314,836 carreaux at 200 m and 377,234 at 1 km**, per viewport, drawn as **flat translucent proportional discs, one per cell**. **No geometry is transported**: each cell is rebuilt from its own INSPIRE identifier by inverting EPSG:3035, which reproduces the published polygon to eight decimals and cuts a Lyon viewport from 1.63 MB to 0.31 MB. Colour is one of eight indicators on absolute national quantile bands; the disc's AREA is the count each indicator is computed on (`ind` or `men`), never the indicator, in **six national size classes** — the measured population quantiles, per grid (`build-filosofi-ramp.mjs --resolution 1000` added the coarse set: 6 727 cells, p90 at 28 652 people). Classed and not proportional because the drawable range is 3:1 in diameter against 100:1 in the data: proportional put 65 % of a Gironde viewport's 1 907 coarse cells on the floor. **A symbol is capped at 0.68 of the cell side — 36 % of its area — and drawn at α 0.7, so the basemap is readable between the discs and through them**; the extruded blocks it replaced covered every cell edge to edge. Imputed cells are drawn as a ring, grown to keep the area the hole costs it. The two grids disagree about their own column names — `i_car_est` at 200 m, `i_est_1km` at 1 km, and no commune at all on the coarse one | `src/data/filosofiCarreaux.js`, `src/data/filosofiFeed.js` | `/api/filosofi/carreaux`, `/api/filosofi/status` (keyless, 30 d disk cache, serve-stale) | viewport-driven (450 ms debounce, ≤ 0.9° box, ≤ 6,000 cells) + 60 min idle |

| Datacenters ▣ | OSM extract (bundled, 4 351 objects) — the footprint is drawn where it is, in WORLD METRES, and the anchor dot drops from 10 px to 6 px so size stops being the channel.

Height is read from `height` first (154 objects) then converted from `building:levels` (374) by a MEASURED factor: the 59 objects carrying both give a median 5.0 m per level (p25 4.0, p75 6.7) — a data hall, not an office floor.

The size channel carries `spanM` instead, the longest dimension measured on the geometry at build time, present on 5 328 (77.89 %), 25 m → 6 399 m (median 100, p95 539), in CONSTANT SCREEN PIXELS — four frozen span classes (100/300/1 000 m) at 18/13/9/6 px plus a hollow 8 px ring for the 1 512 unmeasured (22.1 %). **The row was renamed and simplified on 2026-09-14**: 1 267 of its French features are digues, so the name says so; the 592 hydroelectric stations its world half held moved to `world_hydro/` and the *Centrales hydro* layer; and the second chip row (TOUS/NOMMÉS/GRANDS) was deleted, because GRANDS kept 494 features of which only 65 carry a height — it was a hydro filter wearing a size label.

`src/data/militaryAwareness.js` remains registered internally as the Contacts
coordinator, but it is not a user-visible Data Layers entry. Its visible entry
point is the right-side `CONTEXT` chooser's `CONTACTS` mode.

At global scale, ambient Radio cluster badges are hard-opacity shared-host
entries: count/category updates and identity replacement do not run keyhole or
enter/exit ramps. Shared collision, viewport rejection, allocation, and horizon
culling can still remove an invalid placement, and Cesium still owns the cluster
point geometry and picks. Their 50,000 km line-of-sight range covers the
supported full-globe camera above 24,000 km, including farther horizon clusters.
Unclustered visible stations publish nearest-first ambient labels through that
same host, capped at 16 labels globally, 32 at intermediate zoom, and 48 nearby;
cluster and singleton candidates still share the Radio source's 64-entry ambient
cohort. Cesium continues to own each 13 px station point, horizon visibility,
and direct/nearby picking. Native points and shared-host text use one 50,000 km
interaction limit, so a painted singleton or cluster label always retains a
pickable point at its anchor throughout the supported high-global view. No
Radio entity uses native Cesium label text.

Delivery constraint: PR #10 is stack-only and unsafe standalone. PR #11 owns
the required Radio lifecycle/authority repair, so PR #10 must not merge or ship
unless PR #11 is included in the delivered stack.
Selected and singleton globe labels use the same compact 30-character
presentation: a credible explicit or leading-decimal frequency is rendered
first (`93.9 FM — Station`), otherwise the station name is ellipsized. Full
upstream names remain unchanged in the directory, player, and search state.
Fresh Radio sessions open on All stations while enable and restoration remain
silent. Directory refreshes retain cluster overlay identity for unchanged
represented membership and discard only identities containing removed stations.
When the user explicitly clicks Enable inside the expanded Radio section, the
Context panel performs one internal post-render scroll to reveal the station
filter and primary transport together without moving keyboard focus, the page,
or the globe. Compact controls, voice/tools, restoration, Data Layers, and
programmatic activation do not trigger this reveal.

Radio directory admission is atomic on both sides of the proxy boundary. A
refresh is healthy only when it reaches the minimum accepted-query and station
coverage; schema-valid responses with zero normalized stations count as failed
queries rather than inflating refresh health. Each specialist query also needs
an accepted station whose normalized tags match that requested category; rows
tagged only for another category remain usable catalog data but do not earn
specialist health credit. A partial cold result remains
usable but is explicitly `DEGRADED` and has no accepted catalog generation, while a
partial or malformed refresh cannot replace a warm catalog. The client likewise
rejects stale/future freshness metadata, incomplete rows, and empty catalogs as
a whole, preserving its last usable stations with `STALE`/`DEGRADED` state.
Every healthy admission publishes a monotonically increasing generation scoped
to a restart-stable `catalogInstance` token (a new server process starts a
fresh sequence — never read as a repeat or a regression) with a deeply
immutable station snapshot; stale/degraded warm responses retain the same
generation so tuner and cluster consumers can preserve exact station identity.
Generation semantics assume the app's actual single-process dev-server
deployment; concurrent replicas behind one origin are out of scope.
The client snapshot contains only the normalized station-field allowlist,
preserves object identity for an idempotent repeat of the same generation, and
degrades without replacement if a fresh response presents an older generation.
Snapshot records mark community metadata as untrusted, and Radio tool results
omit station names so directory text never becomes model instruction context.
One bounded country parser maps recognized ISO codes and English/common names
through proxy metadata and final station selection, while malformed, non-ISO,
control-containing, and oversized inputs fail closed. Literal or resolved
non-global IPv4/IPv6 targets are refused. Destroy fully releases the Radio audio
session, voice ducking/restoration, request state, filter, selection, volume,
accepted snapshot, and feed telemetry before re-initialization; monotonic
ownership tokens plus the session boundary keep late callbacks from a retired
session inert.
A tuner drag resolves previews against the single accepted snapshot captured at
pointer-down, even while a newer catalog is admitted. Release starts playback
only when the current same-ID record still exactly matches the frozen
presentation and stream metadata; removal or replacement reports the channel as
unavailable and never silently retargets the drag. A cold degraded fallback may
still populate the directory and globe, but its null accepted generation cannot
populate or begin the tuner.

Context entry and exit consider both rejected lifecycle promises and resolved
`false` manager results to be transaction failures. Entry awaits isolation and
restores the exact prior layer snapshot when isolation or activation fails;
when a direct Context shell fails after lifecycle work starts, reconciliation
waits outside the manager notification until that shell's queue settles, then
restores the complete snapshot rather than treating the in-flight layer as an
exclusion. An uncertain shell is retried and incomplete cleanup retains the
snapshot for a later restore. Direct-shell isolation and its compensating
rollback share one operation-scoped notification token, so an inner lifecycle
failure cannot announce separately from the outer blocked action. Context exit
waits for every sibling transition, retains the exact pending snapshot
after failed compensation, and can retry it later instead of silently reporting
a partial restore. User-facing Context chooser, direct Data Layer shell,
mapped-installation Search, rollback/exit, and Radio chip routes settle those
failures through the existing toast surface, release busy controls, and avoid
unhandled promises. A wrapped operation owns exactly one failure or blocked
notification; its synchronous manager event is suppressed only for that
operation, while unwrapped lifecycle failures retain the manager-level fallback.
The toast is a polite atomic status announcement.
When no tracked entity owns the follow camera, Radio Previous/Next and tuner
previews rotate to the requested broadcaster without changing zoom. A local
view whose optical center remains safely over the Earth, or a full globe already
contained in the viewport keyhole, uses one direct station flight and preserves
its initiating view angle. If a fit-capable Earth disc is clipped/off-center, or
a closer oblique view leaves the viewport center outside the Earth disc, Radio
first animates a centered north-up nadir composition, then focuses the latest
station from that canonical frame. Closer views keep their initiating altitude;
an extreme zoom-out is capped at 13,000 km so recovery returns to a useful
whole-globe scale instead of preserving an empty-space view. The two-stage navigation has one generation:
a playback fallback retargets it to the broadcaster that will play, while a newer
Radio action—including direct globe or non-moving voice selection—supersedes
older callbacks, and layer disable/destroy invalidates
the pending stages. While Flights, Military Flights, or any other
`viewer.trackedEntity` is active, Previous/Next and tuner previews continue to
change station and playback without cancelling or flying the camera. Tracking
acquired between the recenter and focus stages suppresses the later stage, and
a delayed fallback rechecks the same live ownership. Voice Radio navigation
remains non-moving; explicit station focus remains a separate user-requested
route and also yields to a live tracked entity.
The Radio tuner exposes the complete current filtered directory, up to 750
stations, in stable catalog and filter order. Needle progress is absolute across
that directory: the left, center, and right of the control resolve to the first,
middle, and last available station. Every position snaps to a real station, so
there are no selectable static gaps. During a drag, the bounded virtual tape
moves left as the needle moves right and travels faster than the needle without
creating DOM nodes for the complete directory. Camera movement never re-ranks or
rebuilds this order. Tuner-owned preview flights remain monotonic on the captured
strip, and release commits the frozen station before selection and playback
settle. That exact release clears older fallback ownership, so a broadcaster
failure cannot silently play a station left over from an earlier non-playing
cycle; the failed target retains its static/error handoff until Stop or another
explicit choice. Pointer cancellation instead cancels the active preview flight and
restores the exact pre-drag station ordering, absolute position, and frozen
presentation-only marker without starting a replacement camera flight,
committing, or autoplaying. That marker is restored even when an
accepted concurrent catalog removes the station or replaces its metadata, but
it never becomes current playback authority. The next accepted healthy catalog
refresh clears that presentation-only marker, including when the accepted
generation repeats and the immutable directory snapshot is intentionally kept
by identity. Every accepted filter action also clears and rebuilds the marker,
including a request for the already-active filter; a lifecycle-rejected filter
event leaves the restored marker and tuner band untouched. An accepted filter
action synchronously rebuilds the complete navigation pool after the layer state
notification, so Previous/Next and the tuner cannot observe an empty interim
directory. This restoration
also holds at either directory endpoint. Previous/Next traverses the same stable
pool and updates the absolute tuner position.
Cluster refresh identity follows the prior cluster contributing the greatest
absolute number of stations to the new cluster. This preserves majority identity
during merges instead of allowing a fully retained minority to win; deterministic
similarity and stable-ID tie breakers cover equal contributors and splits.
Every positive overlap participates in greatest-contributor discovery, so ratio
thresholds cannot discard a diffuse or one-station maximum. Inheritance is
bilateral mutual-best: a current cluster accepts only a greatest contributor and
a prior identity transfers only to a strongest split child. If that identity is
already claimed by an equal or stronger child, the later cluster receives fresh
identity instead of falling through to a historical minority. Disjoint clusters
also receive fresh identity; sequential fresh IDs are allocated in canonical
membership/station order so input permutations do not rename them.

Voice interprets “turn on/start the radio” as Radio Play, including when it is
combined with a camera action. Explicit “show/enable the Radio layer/markers”
remains a silent layer-only action and does not close the voice session.

Successful explicit user playback from Play/Resume, Previous/Next, the tuner,
or a globe station closes an active voice session only after Radio reaches
`playing`; a failed stream leaves voice active.
An interrupted or superseded voice turn aborts pending Radio location resolution
before it can enable the layer or select a station. Radio enable and disable are
abort-aware manager transactions: cancellation restores the authoritative
pre-transaction state only when the compensating lifecycle call succeeds and
emits no settled explicit-intent event for Context persistence. Failed
activation and teardown expose explicit `enabling` and `disabling` lifecycle
states while the manager retains the last authoritative visibility. The public
lifecycle vocabulary is `enabling`, `enabled`, `disabling`, and `disabled`, plus
a separate uncertainty bit. Radio controls present that phase and remain
non-interactive until the lifecycle is certain `enabled`; only a successful
transaction publishes the new `enabled` or `disabled` settlement. Radio's data
layer state, player message, compact status, launch controls, and generic Data
Layers row explicitly show `UNCERTAIN` when cleanup cannot establish authority;
their accessible labels name the uncertainty while Enable/Disable remains
available to reconcile it.
The Radio source, shared overlays, selected marker, and pick handler use the same
manager-owned presentation gate:
they remain hidden and inert throughout enabling, disabling, cancellation,
failure, and uncertain reconciliation, and activate only for certain `enabled`.
The same gate rejects direct station selection, Previous/Next cycling and its
camera/fallback preparation, tuner-static and category-filter mutation, volume
mutation, and every non-Pause playback toggle before fallback, selection, or
audio state changes. Voice volume and station-starting actions require a fresh
manager lifecycle read.
Every returned `control_radio` result, including status, failure,
cancellation, and a missing Radio module, exposes that same authoritative
`lifecycleState` plus `lifecycleUncertain`; the manager lifecycle record takes
precedence over the stable enabled fallback. Status only reads this state and
does not enqueue lifecycle or player work.
Generic `set_layer_visibility` results expose the same atomic `enabled`,
`lifecycleState`, and `lifecycleUncertain` summary for Radio on success,
fulfilled-false failure, rejection, cancellation, reversal, and missing-module
outcomes. Realtime suppression and settlement refresh all three fields together,
so dedicated and generic Radio routes cannot publish mixed lifecycle snapshots.
`disabled` is inert, while a transitional or uncertain shell is reconciled
through the manager and may proceed only after a fresh read confirms certain
`enabled`; false, rejection, or cancellation preserves the prior player state.
The existing immediate Stop/Pause authority is unchanged.
Cancelled-disable compensation reports failure and records whether lifecycle
state remains uncertain. Any same-target request made while state is uncertain
performs the real lifecycle work instead of taking the stable-state no-op, then
clears that reconciliation debt only after a confirmed enable or disable. A module-local
`AbortError` is a cancellation even while the caller signal remains live, while
that settled transaction releases its abort listener so the old caller cannot
disable a later successful retry. A resolved `false` from init, enable, first
update, or disable is a lifecycle
failure. Unrelated sibling tools remain independent, while each Radio control
captures the current playback-handoff epoch. A later Radio
Pause or Stop provisionally freezes prepared or already-started playback
handoff work without aborting active Select/Play auto-enable or an independent
explicit dedicated or generic Radio visibility ON. After semantic success it
cancels the active Select/Play lane and clears the frozen handoff. Semantic
failure leaves active work live and releases and resumes the frozen handoff.
Disable and generic OFF own visibility as well as playback and may cancel both.
These controls commit their authority only after semantic success, so a failed
stronger control cannot suppress a valid completed sibling. Pause uses the
production player's synchronous boolean contract; Stop and Disable additionally
handle their awaited failure paths. The control's function output is sent before a failed reservation releases,
so resumed playback cannot close the voice channel before the failure is
reported. Resumed handoffs own their attempt-scoped cleanup, so a stale predecessor
cannot clear the successor's in-flight result or block a later failed
reservation from resuming it again.
Generic `set_layer_visibility` Radio disable participates in the same ownership
domain as dedicated Radio controls, so an older Select cannot reverse it. Direct OFF
from either Radio control or the Data Layers row publishes intent before joining
the lifecycle queue and aborts in-flight voice work before an intermediate ON
event can settle. Every absolute manager visibility request also advances a
per-layer intent epoch and aborts the older absolute lifecycle transaction,
including a same-target request whose newer origin must own persistence. An
obsolete queued request never starts; obsolete in-flight cleanup keeps
presentation transitional and hidden, and only the latest request may adopt or
reconcile that state and publish settled visibility. The epoch is rechecked
after synchronous lifecycle-presentation callbacks, so a re-entrant newer
request prevents the older transaction from arming a timer or publishing a
settled visibility event. Superseding an uncertain same-target retry also keeps
the last authoritative enabled boolean until cleanup confirms the real module
state. Direct OFF also freezes
prepared or already-started playback handoff
until the manager queue settles; confirmed OFF discards that handoff, while a
failed OFF releases the reservation and resumes the valid prepared result. A
successful Stop cancels stale Radio work across older response ids as well as
its own response. If a Radio action has already completed its station mutation
before the later control succeeds, only its playback handoff is suppressed; its
result reads enabled state from the manager and audio state from the Radio
module. Voice Pause is a playback-only no-op while the layer is disabled; it
never enables Radio and reports a fulfilled-false pause as failure. A
newer-response or user-origin Stop still cancels stale handoff work.
Only a newer user turn or session teardown aborts the complete active-tool set.
A cancelled turn cannot publish a late Radio playback request. Dedicated Radio
controls and generic layer-visibility commands both forward cancellation.
Each explicit Radio play attempt owns one active audio element; replacement
retires the prior element, making its queued callbacks inert. Pause retires the
current stream and fallback attempt, so delayed callbacks from a replaced or
paused stream cannot change current state or start another station.
Pause and Stop settle attempt ownership and authoritative audio state before
synchronous playback-control observers run, so reentrant voice cleanup cannot
overwrite a released stream with a stale paused state. Layer
destruction likewise retains an enabled manager entry when module disable or
destroy fails semantically, preventing an active orphan and allowing retry.
When Context is collapsed, explicitly activating its Radio header icon reveals
the compact transport; hover and focus alone do not open it. When Context is
expanded, the icon instead expands and scrolls to the embedded Radio section.
Its accessible label, controlled region, and expanded state keep describing the
current route throughout enabling, enabled, disabling, and uncertain lifecycle
renders. Both routes preserve Radio power, playback, station, filter, and volume
state.

Bundled datasets live in `src/data/local_data/` with per-folder provenance READMEs; they are lazily loaded via `src/data/localGeojson.js` (Vite `?url` assets) when toggled on.

A bundled dataset that fails to load is a broken install, not a blip, so it is
never swallowed: `localGeojson.js` guards `response.ok`, reports `error` +
`lastUpdate` through `getStats()` (UNAVAILABLE chip, not a green ON over an
empty globe), and commits its Cesium data source only after setup completes so
a partial failure retries on the next enable. The two non-layer packs
(`naturalEarthRegions.js`, `neighborhoodPolygons.js`) have no stats contract to
report into, so they instead refuse to memoize a failure —
`src/data/retryableLoad.js` caches success permanently and retries a failed
load after a doubling cooldown (5 s → 5 min), which keeps one bad load from
silently demoting every later lookup for the session.

#### Cross-layer joins — `layerJoins.js` (September 2026)

The 2026-09 audit counted the joins in this repository and found three: the
Fiche implantation, the BD TOPO volumes' three themes, and the address
radiography. Outside those, **no layer read another layer's data at all**.

The reason was structural rather than an oversight — a layer module is a
singleton with a lifecycle, and importing one from another couples two
lifecycles, loads a pack that may never be enabled, and makes a cycle the
moment the second layer wants anything back. `src/data/layerJoins.js` is the
smallest thing that removes the obstacle: a string-keyed board of provider
functions. `publishJoin(key, fn)` on enable, the returned teardown on disable,
`askJoin(key, ...args)` from anywhere.

Three properties, and they are the whole reason it is a file:

- **No import edge.** `aisLiveVessels.js` never mentions the ports layer.
- **Absence is ordinary.** A key nobody publishes answers `null`, and the
  consumer says LESS — never an error, never a blank where a sentence was
  promised. That is what makes it honest to join two layers a reader can switch
  off independently.
- **A throw is contained.** `askJoin` catches, warns once per key, returns
  `null`. One misbehaving provider cannot blank a card.

It is deliberately not an event bus, not a cache and not a dependency graph:
nothing here can enable a layer, and a card that needs one switched on says so
rather than switching it on.

The cross-referencing plan of #128 and #129 recorded what the 2026-09 audit
asked for, what landed, and — for each item left out — the reason it was left
out.

Published today:

| Key | Publisher | Read by |
|---|---|---|
| `ports/directory` | `local-ports`, while its pack is LOADED (`onFeatures`) | the selected-vessel card |
| `buoys/nearest` | `marine-buoys`, while it is ENABLED | the selected-vessel card |
| `flights/boundFor` | `flights`, while it is ENABLED | the airport card (`airportCardDetails`) |
| `gauges/nearest` | `hubeau-hydro`, while it is ENABLED, over the records IN VIEW | the small-hydro card |
| `dams/nearest` | `local-dams`, while its pack is LOADED (`onFeatures`) | the small-hydro card |

The two lifetimes differ on purpose. A directory is a fact about a file and is
offered as long as the file is held; a sea state is a reading a visitor asked
to see, and a reader who switched the buoys off asked not to be told about
them.

#### The AIS destination, resolved — `portDirectory.js` (September 2026)

Measured 2026-09-09 over **2 250 distinct vessels** with a non-empty
destination, from twelve consecutive `/api/ais-live` snapshots, against the
2 951 harbours in the pack:

| | | |
|---|---|---|
| resolved by UN/LOCODE | 523 | 23.2 % |
| resolved by port name | 614 | 27.3 % |
| unresolved | 1 113 | 49.5 % |

Four shapes are read and there is no fuzzy fifth: a code (`BEANR`, `IT GOA`), a
leg (`DOVER<=>CALAIS`, `NOMON => TRALI` — the LAST segment, or the card would
name the port the ship has left), a name on a folded key, and a name followed
by a berth the field's own twenty-character ceiling cut off
(`ANTWERPEN 4E HAVENDO`). A leading token that names a KIND of place (`PORT`,
`TERMINAL`, `QUAI`) is never tried alone.

Two guards, both measured:

- **`Port Of Le Havre`.** 322 of 2 951 WPI names carry a generic head a master
  never types. The stripped form is indexed ALONGSIDE the published one.
- **`PORT_NAME_MATCH_MAX_M` = 2 500 km.** A code is the master's own identifier
  and is trusted at any range (the longest legitimate one in the sample is
  9 131 km); a name is a spelling that happened to agree. The sample splits
  cleanly: 16 legitimate name matches from 301 km to 1 348 km, then nothing
  until the 18 wrong ones from 5 006 km up — `PORTLAND` and `PORTSMOUTH` from
  the Channel, resolved to Oregon and New Hampshire because the WPI carries no
  English harbour of either name.

The unresolved half is printed exactly as the master typed it, which is what
the card did before this module existed.

#### The hydraulic chain (September 2026)

A small-hydro card names its installed power and its head, and neither register
behind it carries the two facts a reader wants next: how much water is going
past, and what is holding it back. `gauges/nearest` and `dams/nearest` supply
both, and the wording of both lines is the load-bearing part.

- **A DISCHARGE or nothing.** `nearestHubeauGauge` skips every station
  reporting only a stage, however close. A stage is a height above a gauge zero
  specific to that gauge — `hubeauHydrometry.js` spends a paragraph on why two
  stations' stages are not comparable — and putting one beside a plant's
  installed power would invite exactly that comparison. Ceiling 25 km
  (`HUBEAU_JOIN_MAX_M`), and the layer is viewport-driven, so a plant outside
  the current box gets no answer rather than a cached one from another region.
- **A NEIGHBOUR, never an identity.** Nothing in ODRÉ or OSM links a structure
  to a plant. The line says *ouvrage voisin cartographié, aucun registre ne le
  relie à cette centrale* (“neighboring structure on the map, no register links
  it to this plant”), names the distance, and never writes *son barrage* (“its
  dam”).
  Ceiling 10 km (`DAM_JOIN_MAX_M`) — wide enough for an intake and a
  powerhouse kilometres apart, tight enough to stay in the same valley.
- **A named structure beats a closer anonymous one.** 4 579 of the pack's 6 189
  features carry no name, no height and no operator. An unnamed one is still
  returned when it is all there is: "there is something here and OSM does not
  know what" is an answer.

Both lines name the river or the structure so the reader can check the claim,
which is the same standard `buildPlacementLines` already holds this card to.

#### Flight and airport, both directions (September 2026)

`AUS → LAX` becomes `AUS → LAX · 1994 km` on the tracked contact's readout.
adsbdb has published the destination's coordinates since `adsbdbProxy` was
written and only `flightRouteArc` ever read them. `_remainingLegKm` measures
from the BILLBOARD's position — the same fix `_routeIsPlausible` uses, so the
two halves of one line cannot come from two different positions — and returns
`null` rather than a guess when the leg carries no coordinate.

The other direction is a join: `flights/boundFor` on the board, read by
`airportCardDetails`, which gains a line like `1 en approche — TVF57PQ`. Only a
route `routePlausible` accepts is counted, for the same reason the route LINE
is gated on it: a wrong-leg answer would put traffic on a field the aircraft is
nowhere near. Two codes are passed because adsbdb publishes ONE and it is not
always the same one (`iata_code || icao_code`), and the pack has both columns.

**Its ceiling is low today and the code says so.** `_requestRouteEnrichment`
fires for the TRACKED contact only, so a fresh session resolves no routes and
the join answers 0/0 for every field; it fills as a reader tracks flights.
Widening it means enqueuing route lookups for the ambient fleet, which is a
change to a token bucket sized by measurement against TYPE lookups
(`ENRICH_AMBIENT_BUDGET_CEIL` = 1000, refill 150/5 min, `qa:enrich-budget`) —
a separate measured decision, and one this change deliberately did not make.

#### The door to the radiography, and the sheet's two missing halves (September 2026)

`src/data/ficheSheet.js` is a layer-owned, self-mounting panel — the same idiom
as `veloPulseHud.js` — that FRAMES `fiche.html` at the point the globe is
scanning. It is opened by a `RADIOGRAPHIE` chip on the `Zone de chalandise`
row, published by `implantation-fr`.

WHY IT EXISTS. Two surfaces answered the same question about the same door and
nothing linked them: the globe's fiche card is capped at six lines
(`createAddressScanOverlayEntry`, `.slice(0, 6)` — the right cap for a label
pinned on a doorway) and `fiche.html` holds sixty rows, printable, reachable
only by typing its URL.

WHY AN IFRAME. `fiche.html` already ships `?embed=1`, which strips its masthead
form and print button precisely so it can be framed, and it is a Cesium-free
page by explicit decision (`CESIUM_FREE_PAGES`). Re-rendering its sixty rows
inside the globe bundle would mean two renderers for one document, and the
second would be the one nobody prints. Same origin, same session, same server
cache.

The frame is EMPTIED on close, not merely hidden: an iframe left pointed at the
sheet keeps seventeen requests and their timers alive behind a panel nobody is
reading. Re-pointing at the same place is a no-op rather than a reload.

The chip travels through `setParams({sheet})` and is deliberately absent from
`getParams()`: a share link carries what the map SAYS, and whether a reader had
a panel open is not that. It returns `true` because the manager treats `false`
as a rejection and would log a fault for a chip that did what it was asked.

THE SHEET NOW READS SEVENTEEN ROUTES, not fifteen. Two themes were answering
half their own question, and the audit had counted both routes as "in
production for a layer, with no line on the sheet":

- **Nuisances** gains `/api/bruit-fr` — the PEB or PGS band under the point,
  with its index, its range and the date of its order (*arrêté*); outside every plan, the
  nearest aerodrome and its distance. A band with `atPoint: false` (the
  overview wash the layer draws AROUND an aerodrome, tested against no point)
  never reaches the sheet.
- **Numérique** (Digital) gains `/api/anfr-fr/supports` — masts around the address by
  generation, counting only what RADIATES (`live`), never what is approved
  (`plan`). An empty NATIONAL register is reported as an empty register and
  never as an empty street; see `docs/KNOWN-ISSUES.md` for the 222-byte
  upstream CSV that made that distinction load-bearing on the day it shipped.

Both join an existing theme rather than founding one of their own — the same
"one subject, one heading" decision the layer panel just made.

#### Fused rows — one subject, one line (September 2026)

`src/data/layerFusions.js` is the one table that says which rows are the SAME
SUBJECT. `layerTaxonomy.js` answers "what is this dataset and which group does
it belong to", which is a per-layer question; "are these two rows one subject?"
is a statement about a PAIR, and a per-layer field can only hold half of it.

Fifteen entries fold **23 layers** into the row of the subject they belong to.
The panel goes from **61 rows to 38** (36 core layers plus the two plugged
datasets). What a fusion changes is presentation and nothing else:

- the companion keeps its **id, module, lifecycle, cache and share token**, so a
  link sent before the merge restores exactly what it always restored;
- the companion keeps its own **map-legend entry** — the key is gathered per
  layer from `getAll()` and never went through a row;
- the companion keeps its **credit line**.

On the row, each companion becomes a **fusion chip**: round, dotted (`○` off,
`●` on), against the square option chips the panel already had. The row toggle
enables the primary and the companions that FOLLOW it; a companion marked
`optIn` (only `comparables-fr` today, the reader's own dossier) waits for its
chip. Switching a row OFF takes the whole group down, `optIn` included — a lit
chip under a dark row would be a layer drawing with no visible control.

**The voice surface switches the SUBJECT.** `set_layer_visibility` drives the
primary through the intent protocol — the operator's utterance is reported on
that one transition — and then calls `setRowFollowers`, which moves the
companions beside it and names them back in the result as `companions`. Without
it, *montre les transports en commun* (“show public transit”) lit `transit-fr` alone and left
Île-de-France with no vehicles, which is the exact gap the fusion closes. An
unfused layer's answer is byte-identical to what it was: the key is named only
when there are followers. The bare word *météo* (weather) was moved off
`meteo-stations-fr`'s alias list for the same reason — it names the row now,
and *stations météo* (weather stations) still reaches the instruments.

A row whose primary is off but whose companion a share link left on reads `OFF`
and still shows its chips, so the drawn layer is always controllable. The
button's DIRECTION is read from the primary: pressing it switches the subject
ON rather than switching off the one thing that is drawing.

The chip strip of a fused row carries chips from several modules. Their ids are
namespaced (`comptages-fr::w04`), because two modules can each publish a chip
called `week` and on a shared strip that collision would make one chip apply
the other's params. A companion's option chip carries its owner's name at the
head of its tooltip, and a left edge in the stylesheet.

**Which layer keeps the row** is a product decision stated in the table: where a
fusion mixes a layer that has data everywhere with one that stops at the French
border, the WORLD layer is primary (`bikeshare` over `shared-mobility-fr`,
`local-datacenters` over `anfr-fr`). A row chipped `FR` over a world subject
tells a reader outside France that a layer serving them is not for them.
`layerFusions.test.mjs` asserts it.

**What the fusion does NOT do**, and is owed separately: deduplicate the 56
plants three registers share (`edf-power-plants`, `rte-generation`,
`fr-hydro-plants`, plus 14 in `gas-fr`), and move the doctor (*médecin*) family out of
`amenities-fr`. The row merge is the first half of that work.

#### Viewport-gated layers and the view gate (September 2026)

Three layers refuse a request box above a ceiling — Bâti 3D at **0.08°**, the
mapped grid at **0.8°**, Hub'Eau at **20°** — because one click from a
continental camera would otherwise ask a public service for half a country.

Two rules keep that ceiling from reading as a broken layer:

- **A gated load is not a failed load.** `load()` answers "did this tick fetch
  anything"; `update()` answers the manager's different question, and only a
  recorded error is a failed refresh. Returning the guidance state as `false`
  made the manager treat it as the module rejecting its lifecycle: the layer was
  torn back down on enable, the toggle flipped to OFF, and the operator got
  `<layer> could not start cleanly` over a healthy feed.
- **The zoom a layer needs is applied, not announced.** A layer may expose
  `ensureViewGate(viewer, { signal })`. Three do: `powerGrid`,
  `bdtopoBuildings`, `cadastreParcels`. It is reached from the **zoom card**
  (`src/zoomPrompt.js`) — the reader presses *Zoomer ici* (Zoom here) and the layer solves
  and flies. A gate that throws or cannot be satisfied is not a failure: the
  layer stays ON with its own guidance text.

  It used to run automatically, awaited by the manager after `enable()` for
  explicit intent only (`user`, `voice`, `tool`). **That call no longer exists
  in `manager.js`** — it was lost somewhere between #35 and today's `main`, and
  for a while the three solvers were dead code nothing called. Which is also
  why `npm run qa:view-gate` was a baseline failure. Restoring the automatic
  flight is a separate decision from offering the button: switching a layer on
  is not, on its own, permission to move somebody's camera.

`src/data/viewGate.js` solves the camera: it sizes the metre budget off
**longitude** (the tighter axis off the equator — sizing off latitude overshoots
by 45% in France), steepens a pitch shallower than **−55°** (a horizon-facing
camera sees to the horizon at any altitude, so altitude alone cannot satisfy a
box ceiling), never flies UP, seats the result on `globe.getHeight()`, then
re-asks the layer's own gate after the flight and tightens twice more before
giving up. The focus is the centre of the current view, pulled onto the layer's
coverage only when that coverage fills ≥5% of the view or the camera is holding
more than 30° (aimed at nothing in particular); a 400 km camera over Berlin that
clips 0.1° of Alsace is looking at Berlin and is left there. Bâti 3D flies only
for `too-wide`, never for `off-coverage`. Hub'Eau has no `ensureViewGate` on
purpose: its gate is 20°, so the only camera it refuses is a global one, and the
zoom that satisfies it over the mid-Pacific still finds no French river gauge.

Proved by `npm run qa:view-gate` in a real browser (420 000 m → ~2 900 m over
France, buildings drawn, no lifecycle failure published) and by
`src/data/viewGate.test.mjs`, which flies the solved camera in an independent
model of what a camera sees and asserts the box lands under the ceiling —
including non-cardinal headings, where the axis-aligned rectangle has to contain
a rotated trapezoid.

#### The zoom card (September 2026)

**Thirteen layers refuse to draw above a ceiling of their own, and at a
continental camera twelve of them are outside it at once.** Every one says so
honestly — a guidance status, a sentence in `loadingLabel`, a chip that stays
green because a zoom gate is not a fault — and all of it lands in a sub-line of
a panel row, in small type, in a panel that can be collapsed to a 0×0 box. The
reader watching an empty globe at 1 000 km never saw it.

`src/zoomPrompt.js` states it at **42% of the viewport height** — above centre,
so the card does not cover the subject it is talking about — as one card for all
the waiting layers: up to three rows, then *+N autres* (“+N more”). The words are the
LAYER'S own `loadingLabel`, never a second sentence written in the card that
could drift from the row. Where the layer exposes `ensureViewGate()`, the row
carries **_Zoomer ici_ (Zoom here)**, which is what finally calls the three solvers.

The ceilings, measured from the source: `road-status-fr` 2 000 km · `transit-fr`
300 km · `bruit-fr` 250 km · `power-grid` 120 km outside France (inside it the national pack draws at any altitude) · `shared-mobility-fr` 80 km ·
`idfm-network` 20 km · `sitadel-fr` 12 km · `cadastre-fr` and the `fraicheur-fr`
trees 1,5 km; and by view span rather than altitude, `hubeau-hydro` 20° ·
`military-installations` 10° · `filosofi-fr` 0,9° · `bdtopo-buildings` 0,08°.

Three details that are not obvious:

- **The card is `pointer-events: none`; only its buttons are not.** It sits over
  the middle of a globe people drag.
- **It is repainted twice after a camera stop, at 600 ms and 1 600 ms.** The
  panel repaints on `moveEnd` (`setCoverageView`), but a gated layer's verdict
  about that camera does not exist yet at that instant — the layers debounce
  their own viewport read.
- **A dismissal is remembered against the SET of waiting layers**, not for the
  session: the same situation stays closed, a different one is news again.
- **The card leaves on the PRESS of _Zoomer ici_, in 140 ms** — not when the
  layer stops being gated. It used to stand through the 1,6 s flight and the
  settle behind it, which reads as a button that did nothing. The situation is
  held in `_zoomPromptFlyingSignature` for the length of the flight so the
  scheduled re-reads cannot bring it back mid-camera, and released when the
  flight settles: a flight that did not reach the gate brings the card straight
  back with its button re-armed.

Every prompt is in French and says **zoome** (zoom in), which two layers
already did and eleven did not — three were still in English, the rest said
*descends*, *descendez* (go lower) or *rapprochez-vous* (move closer) for the
same act.

#### French address layers (September 2026)

Six layers scan around the ground point the camera is LOOKING AT — via
`deriveFetchCenter()`, shared with the traffic layer — rather than over the
viewport, because all of their upstreams take a coordinate and a radius, not a
box; the permit registers go further and are published per COMMUNE, which a box
cannot even name. They go dormant and clear their draw above 12 km
(`idfm-network`: 20 km), and report `dormant` in `getStats()` so an empty screen
is never ambiguous between "too high to scan" and "this address is clear".

**Three of the six now paint the BD TOPO volumes instead of only pinning them**
(2026-09-03, via `src/data/buildingTheme.js` — see the Bâti 3D row above for the
registry contract). `dpe-fr` reduces a building to the MODE of its diagnostics,
ties broken by the worst letter, and its badge goes QUIET (12 px instead of 20)
only where the volume underneath already says the letter — so a unanimous block
falls silent and a B→F block keeps every dissenting badge on its roof.
`dvf-sales` takes the MOST RECENT mutation, never a median: the editions span up
to five years, so a median would publish a price nobody paid on a date that does
not exist — and it keeps that mutation even when it has no €/m², painting the
volume a declared neutral rather than sending a building that has just changed
hands back into the “no sale here” wash. `ads-fr` offers only dossiers that can
bear on EXISTING fabric (declared work on an existing building, demolition
permits, and unpublished nature); a declared new build and a development permit (*permis d'aménager*) —
which authorises LAND — are held back, counted, and stay cranes.

**The join is by IDENTIFIER first since 2026-09-07, and by geometry only then.**
The Référentiel National des Bâtiments gives every building in France one stable
key, and the BD TOPO tiles this repository already draws carry it
(`identifiants_rnb`, 95.5 % to 99.2 % of drawn footprints). The ADEME DPE
register publishes the same key as `id_rnb` on 34.5 % to 73.7 % of its rows
depending on the commune, so `dpe-fr` no longer needs a coordinate to reach a
volume — and the coordinate was never a claim about a building. Measured over
four boxes: diagnostics reaching a drawn volume go 81.8 % → 96.3 % (Paris 13e),
40.4 % → 75.7 % (Lyon 2e), 78.8 % → 88.9 % (Marseille), 14.0 % → 41.5 %
(Ustaritz), and 2 to 83 rows per box were being painted on a NEIGHBOUR's roof.
The two paths are counted apart (`themeMatchedById` / `themeMatchedByPoint`,
*96 % par identifiant RNB* (“96% by RNB identifier”) on the Bâti 3D row): they paint the same colour and
are not the same claim. The join costs no request — both registers carry the key
— and `rnbPivot.js` states the two multiplicities that break a naive index (one
emprise merging several RNB buildings; one building drawn as several emprises).
`npm run qa:rnb-pivot` re-measures all of it, including the 573-of-573 agreement
between the RNB's own `bdtopo` identifiers and the tiles' `cleabs`. DVF and the
permits are NOT joined this way and cannot be: the geolocated DVF file publishes
no RNB column, only `id_parcelle`, and the parcel→building relation has no bulk
endpoint.

**A selected volume names itself.** Clicking a building fires one keyless,
unproxied RNB lookup (~170 ms) and the card gains the BAN addresses that
building answers to and the cadastral parcels it stands on. A footprint IGN
published without an identifier (4.5 % of Paris) is resolved by proximity
instead, and the card says so — a guessed identity must not read like a
published key.

**Scope mismatch, declared rather than corrected.** The scans cover 200 m (DPE),
300 m (DVF) and 400 m (ADS) while the building layer loads a box up to 0.08°,
i.e. 8.90 × 6.04 km = 53.8 km² at the 47th parallel — up to 107× more. At most
~1 % of the volumes on screen were ever inside the question. Each theme's
"no data" label therefore names BOTH silences (*hors du rayon de 300 m ou sans
mutation*, “outside the 300 m radius or no sale”), and the honest count lives on the Bâti 3D row rather than being
recomputed on each theme's row, which would give two numbers for one fact.

| Layer | Token | Proxy | Upstream |
|---|---|---|---|
| `georisques` | `gr` | `/api/georisques` | Géorisques (BRGM) — 3 endpoints fanned out per scan |
| `dvf-sales` | `dv` | `/api/dvf` | geo-DVF CSV per commune-year, parsed and cached server-side |
| `avis-valeur` | `vv` | `/api/avis-valeur` | the SAME geo-DVF editions, read as comparables — the estimate, not a source |

### `avis-valeur` — the estimate, and the two uncertainties it never merges

`avis-valeur` (`vv`, `/api/avis-valeur`, `src/data/avisValeurFeed.js` +
`src/data/avisValeur.js`) is the seventh address layer and the first whose
product is a NUMBER WE COMPUTED. The Cityscan teardown (#99) put it at the top
of tier 2 (#101): of the eleven data routes behind `app.cityscan.fr` not one
carries a source we do not already have, and their own public translation file
credits *Source : Algorithme* (“Source: Algorithm”) for exactly one module — the
estimate.

**One plugin, two routes.** The estimate reads the SAME memoised commune-year
editions `/api/dvf` was drawn from (`dvfProxy` in `vite.config.js` mounts both),
so a card can never quote a median the dots on screen were not part of, and an
estimate costs zero extra downloads once the sales layer has scanned. The
edition store now memoises the PENDING PROMISE rather than the finished array:
measured before that, eight subjects asked about one doorway concurrently
produced **eight downloads of the same 750 KB edition**, because the shared
in-flight coalescer keys on the whole request and two subjects never met.

**Never a price without its interval, and never an interval without saying which
uncertainty it is.** `prixM2.p25`–`p75` is where comparable goods actually
traded per square metre — the market's own dispersion, which does not shrink
with more data and does not bound the subject. `prixM2.ci90` is the classical
distribution-free interval on the MEDIAN, `[x(k), x(n+1−k)]` with coverage
`1 − 2·P(Bin(n, ½) < k)` accumulated in log space (a Paris commune rung reaches
1 802 comparables and `2 ** 1024` is `Infinity`). Nominal coverage 93,8 / 93,0 /
96,1 / 90,1 % at n = 5 / 8 / 12 / 30; **resampled 3 000 times from the 4 192
Paris 13e flat sales of editions 2023–2025 it measures 93,6 / 93,0 / 96,9 /
90,8 %**, and 94,2 / 92,9 / 95,9 / 89,8 % over Rodez's 1 214.

**Both ends of it are printed, never one `±`.** An interval built from order
statistics is asymmetric whenever the sample is, and half its width is not its
distance from the median: 20 comparables at 600 × 6, 1 000 × 10, 1 400 × 4 give
a median of 1 000 and an interval of [600, 1 000] — half-width 20 %, lower bound
**40 % below the median**. Live on avenue de France the Paris answer reads
**−5,3 % / +3,2 %**, where a `±` would have said 4,3 %.

**The floor of five is derived.** At n = 4 the widest such interval — the whole
sample — covers the median with probability 0.875, so no 90 % interval exists.

**The centre is published only when two clauses hold**: the interval on the
median is STRICTLY narrower than `p75 − p25` (we must know the middle better
than the market is dispersed — no constant in it), and neither of its ends sits
more than 20 % from the median. Strictly, because the equality case is the
degenerate one: a sample with no spread has both quantities at zero, and a `>`
comparison published *1 000 €/m², ±0 %* (“€1,000/m², ±0%”) from twelve identical prices with
96 % confidence attached. Measured on live ground the two clauses catch
different things: around Aurillac at 300 m, 43 sales give 973 €/m² at ±22,6 % —
clause 1 passes, clause 2 refuses, and the 600 m rung answers 1 333 €/m² at
±8,2 %, so the refused answer was 37 % away from the one 159 sales agree on. At
Biarritz the 1 500 m rung returns 7 sales whose interval is wider than the
interquartile range; clause 1 refuses and the commune rung answers 4 127 €/m² at
±6,9 %.

**Two disclosures the arithmetic does not make on its own**, both on the card
and in the legend. *Distribution-free removes an assumption about shape, not
about sampling*: the interval is exact for independent draws, and the
comparables are a near-census of one pocket, so the honest reading is a model
(“these sales behave as an independent draw from the price law of this
pocket”). And *the rung is chosen with the same prices that then set the
interval's width*, which can only lower real coverage — measured by resampling
each commune's own price law onto its own geography, 4 000 draws each:
**92,5 % (Paris 13e), 91,9 % and 92,0 % (Rodez), 92,8 % (Biarritz)** against
nominals of 90,1 to 96,9 %. On a law built to break it — two atoms at 1 000 and
10 000 with the population median at 5 500 — the same procedure covers 89,8 %
across all rungs and **0 % across the 931 centres it agrees to publish**. No
in-sample test catches that; the shape is a commune whose two halves are two
markets, and it is written down rather than patched.

**Three answers, three sentences (A1)**: `comparables` (a centre and a band),
`range` (the band, the centre named as WITHHELD, and the clause that withheld
it), `none` (nothing at all). The subject marker is painted `#00ffa3` for the
first and `#9aa7bd` for the other two, and it is the pack's **target**
silhouette rather than the euro: the comparables are real mutations and keep the
register's own sign, so the one marker that is not a transaction is the one that
is not a euro sign.

**The euro band is not a range anyone paid.** It is the €/m² band multiplied by
the SUBJECT's surface, and it is printed on its own line saying so — *soit
417 000 € à 545 000 € ramené aux 60 m² du sujet — pas des prix payés* (“i.e.
€417,000 to €545,000 scaled to the subject's 60 m² — not prices paid”). Printed
as one sentence with *la moitié des ventes comparables* (“half of the comparable
sales”) it was false whenever
the comparables were not all the subject's size: forty sales of 48 m² and 72 m²
all at 1 000 €/m² give a 60 000 € band that not one of the forty landed in.

**The ladder spends distance before surface**, and the order is measured. Rungs:
300 m ±20 %, 600 m ±20 %, 1,5 km ±20 %, the whole commune ±20 %, the whole
commune ±35 %. Widening the BAND moves the €/m² between the lower and upper half
of the band by 3,0 → 3,6 % in Paris 13e, 4,0 → 10,7 % in Lille and **13,3 →
20,4 % in Ajaccio** going from ±20 % to ±35 % — a bias that never shows.
Widening the RADIUS costs the "for here" premise, but the radius is printed,
drawn as a ring, and every rung tried is reported with the clause that rejected
it. The commune rungs draw NO ring: a commune is not a disc.

**The register's hole, named.** DVF does not cover the Bas-Rhin, the Haut-Rhin,
the Moselle or Mayotte — the *livre foncier* départements. Measured 2026-09-08
on the 2024 edition, `67482`, `57463`, `68224` and `97611` each answer **404
with a 233-byte body** while `97411` (La Réunion) answers 200 with 647 463 bytes
— so the hole is four départements and not "the overseas territories", which is
the guess that would have been wrong. `dvfCoverage()` separates
`register-does-not-cover` from `no-comparable`, and `/api/dvf` carries the same
field so the sales layer stops reading as "nothing was sold in Strasbourg".

**A 404 and a timeout are no longer the same edition.** `loadEdition` used to
cache every failed download as an empty commune-year, in memory with no TTL and
on disk for a week, so one reset made an outage permanent and the estimate
published from the surviving years without saying so. Only a 404 is cached as
empty now; anything else returns `null`, is not remembered, and is passed to the
card as `unavailableYears`, which the card prints as *ces éditions EXISTENT et
ne sont pas arrivées* (“these editions EXIST and did not arrive”).

**Four exclusions, each counted and named on the row.** VEFA (a dwelling that
does not exist yet — measured on Paris 13e editions 2021–2025, the 9 priced VEFA
sit at 13 077 €/m² against 9 150 for ordinary resale, **+43 %**); the one-euro
flat (`round(1/88)` is **0**, a number, which clears every guard upstream — 7 in
Paris 13e, 6 in Bordeaux, 6 in Lille, 1 in Aurillac over editions 2023–2025, one
of them a 166 m² flat on place Pinel); a priced sale with no coordinate, which
no radius can test; and the same mutation handed in twice. That last one is a
query string: `years=2025,2025,2025,2025,2025` used to reach the projection as
five copies of every sale — 28 comparables became 140 and the interval narrowed
from [7 969, 8 359] to [8 052, 8 220] — so the route deduplicates the years and
the projection deduplicates the ids. What is NOT excluded is the low tail above
zero: across 31 609 priced resales in nine communes the declared values run 1 €
→ 160 € → 400 € → 1 800 € → 3 000 € → 4 950 € → 20 000 € with no break, so any
cut would be a plausibility model wearing a constant's clothes. The retained
sales declared under 10 000 € are COUNTED (`symbolicCount`) instead — and the
euro rounding is derived from the magnitude for the same reason, because a flat
1 000 € step turned every positive total under 500 € into *0 €* (“€0”).

**The drift is measured and printed, never applied.** Commune median €/m² 2023 →
2025: Paris 13e −4,3 %, Bordeaux −9,2 %, Lille −3,6 %, Rodez −0,5 %, Ajaccio
+1,6 %. A median comparable in a three-edition window is ~18 months old, so the
residual bias of not correcting is 2–5 %. The correction's own noise — a
commune-year median is itself a sample median, ±7 to ±11 % at 30 sales in the
year — is larger than what it would remove. The per-edition medians and counts
are shown; nothing is restated in another year's money.

**A click pins the subject**, the same wrapper `isochroneRings.js` uses, and the
pin lifts the altitude ceiling. Two things changed in the shared shell for it,
and both are bugs the other six layers had too: `setScanPin` now FORCES the
rescan, because the 250 m movement guard describes camera drift and a pin is not
drift (measured, a pin moved 111 m changed `getParams().centre` and fired no
request at all, leaving the answer describing the previous door); and
`setParams` validates every key before applying any, because it used to write
each key as it checked it and so returned its documented refusal with half the
change already in force.

`npm run qa:avis-valeur` proves the whole boundary in a real browser over Paris,
Les Monts-Verts (Lozère) and Strasbourg: dormancy at 40 km with no request, the
card surviving the factory's own ` · ` splitter, the three band classes counted
against the comparables drawn, the subject changing the comparable SET rather
than rescaling one, the pin, a live `range` refusal naming its clause, and the
livre-foncier sentence.

`ads-fr` is also the only one of the six that carries a CONTROL. Its row shows
three chips — **3 ANS / 6 ANS / 13 ANS** — where the query used to carry two
frozen constants, and the default stays at three years so nothing moves for a
reader who touches nothing. The other two rungs are not symmetry: 13 years is
Sitadel's whole span (`ADS_MAX_MONTHS`), and **6 years is the shortest rung that
reaches a finished house** — Ustaritz's `06454721B0009` was authorised
2021-07-20 and read in 2026-09, so a 36-month floor of 2023-09-01 hides the
permit that built it. A chantier outlives the window that shows it.

The choice rides the share link as `lo=au.w.6`, which makes `ads-fr` the first
of the six address layers to own a layer-state option: a window is a question,
and reopening the same block over six years is a different answer. The values
are a CLOSED SET and `setParams` REJECTS anything outside it rather than
clamping — everything reachable through that path is reachable from a
stranger's URL, and snapping a stale link's window to the nearest legal value
would answer a question nobody asked while looking exactly like the one they
did. The chips and the parameter gate are one mechanism seen from two ends;
`addressScanLayer.js` grew `runtimeParams`, `rowControls`, `getParams` and
`setParams` for it, so the other five layers can take controls later without a
second mechanism.

The ACTIVE chip carries the truncation warning, because widening the window is
what causes it: `ADS_MAX_PERMITS` serves the 400 nearest dossiers, so on a dense
block a longer window does not add history — it trades the far edge of the
circle for it, and nothing on screen says so.

`ads-fr` is the only one of the six that reads TWO registers and merges them on
the dossier number. Sitadel is national, monthly, about six weeks behind, and
holds authorisations that were GRANTED only — the SDES dictionary says so, and
there is no national open feed of applications under instruction because
Plat'AU is closed. The three métropole portals supply exactly that missing
half, daily. Both halves are cached per commune-window on disk for a week: a
cold commune costs four sequential DiDo calls (parallel ones are rate-limited
to HTTP 429) plus one bulk BAN geocode — measured at 13-15 s for Paris — and
every scan inside that commune afterwards is served from cache.

**Bordeaux is the only one of them that publishes the GROUND**, and the layer
draws it: the footprint (*emprise*) of the parcels a dossier names, clamped onto the terrain
under the crane that marks the dossier itself.

**And for a year every plot card in France said so, including the ones Bordeaux
never touched.** The sentence *emprise publiée par Bordeaux Métropole* (“footprint
published by Bordeaux Métropole”) was
hard-coded when Bordeaux was the only source of a shape here; the cadastral
placement below then gave the whole country an outline and the credit was never
moved, so an Ustaritz parcel drawn from the Etalab cadastre was crediting a
métropole 200 km away. Fixed 2026-09-14: `empriseProvenanceLine` reads the
provenance off the dossiers standing on the plot — the portal's own label where
the counter shipped the geometry, *emprise cadastrale — la parcelle nommée par
le dossier* (“cadastral footprint — the parcel named by the dossier”) where this
layer joined it, both where one outline serves both.

Everywhere else the ground is RESOLVED rather than published, and
`cadastreLineage.js` is what does it. Sitadel carries no coordinate but names up
to three cadastral parcels per dossier, and Etalab publishes the cadastre — so
the permit is placed on its own plot before the geocoder is asked anything.
Measured 2026-09-02: **58,1 % of Ustaritz's 543 rows** and **2 307 rows of
Paris** resolve to a parcel that still exists, which is a placement no address
lookup can match and which shrinks the BAN batch by the same amount. A permit
placed this way also survives a geocoder outage, where before this the whole
commune came back empty.

**37,3 % of those rows name a parcel that is gone, and that is the register
working rather than failing**: you file on a field, the field is divided, you
build on a lot. Etalab has published DATED editions of the whole cadastre since
2017-07-06, so the layer walks back at most three editions from the decision
date, finds the parent alive, intersects it with today's parcels and reads the
division off the ground. The area of the children has to account for the parent
to within 12 % or the lineage is refused — a redraw moves vertices by
centimetres, a wrong parent moves them by lots. On `06454721B0009` at Ustaritz:
AN 221 alive at 2021-04-01 and gone at 2021-07-01, three months before the
permit was granted, into AN 511 (811 m²) + AN 512 (527) + AN 513 (34) —
**1 372 m² against the parent's 1 372, to the square metre**.

Which of the lots was built on comes from the same archive's BUILDING files,
and which lot carries which number comes from the commune's *Base Adresse
Locale* — the only published join between a house number and a parcel, and one
that contradicts the counter where they disagree (two Ustaritz dossiers are
filed at "67 impasse d'Haroztegia" and name AN 515, which the BAL numbers 63).
Neither is a guess and neither always answers: over the 125 ambiguous divisions
of Ustaritz since 2018 the building diff names a single lot in **29,6 %** of
cases, 45,6 % have several children built and 24,8 % have none. The rest are
drawn on the PARENT, labelled *emprise avant division* (“footprint before
subdivision”), because a polygon that certainly contains the site beats a
confident dot in the road. A development permit (*permis d'aménager*) always
stays on the parent — it is the act of drawing the lots, not
a project on one — and two dossiers competing for the same built lot both fall
back to the parent unless their own BAL numbers separate them.

The limits are counted rather than hidden. The archive floor is July 2017, so
permits authorised 2013-2016 lose 61 of 161 against 5 of 227 for 2018-2021; a
reference with a letter suffix (`255P`, *partie de parcelle*) is flagged as
provisional instead of being padded into a number that does not exist; and the
scan reports `placed`, `divided`, `resolved`, `onChild` and `onParent`
commune-wide, alongside the geocoding shortfall it already reported.

The snapshots are cached in `.gev-cache/cadastre` as the gzip they arrived as —
676 KB for a commune's parcels, 239 KB for its buildings — because a DATED
edition is immutable and never needs revalidating; only `latest` carries a TTL,
of a month. The first cut stored parsed JSON and one commune's thirteen years
took 186 MB, against 27 MB gzipped, under a 256 MB LRU ceiling. A cold Paris
commune-window costs about 45 s, most of it the twenty arrondissement cadastres
its permits resolve across, downloaded eight at a time; every scan inside that
commune afterwards is served from cache in milliseconds.

The outline belongs to the PLOT, not to the file, and `liftEmprises` in
`adsFeed.js` is what enforces that. Bordeaux repeats the same emprise once per
dossier standing on it: measured on the default 400 m scan of place Pey-Berland
on 2026-09-02, **392 dossiers over 252 distinct plots**, one of them carrying
nine. Shipping it per dossier would be wrong three times over — 166 KB of
repeated geometry against 94 KB of distinct geometry; nine translucent copies
of one plot painting it at 0.83 alpha where a single copy reads 0.18, so the
thickest FILE on the block looks like the biggest project on it; and Cesium's
`StaticGroundGeometryColorBatch` opening a fresh `GroundPrimitive` for every
instance whose bounding rectangle collides with one already batched, which two
copies of a parcel always do. The plot is keyed on its GEOMETRY and merely
NAMED by `refcad`: the same file writes a parcel reference in the short
`063KH215` form and, on 47 of 3 927 rows in 2022 Q1, in the 14-character IDU
form, and one row in a few thousand lists the same parcel twice — any of which
splits one plot into two identical stacked washes. Across 5 186 rows, 2 737
distinct parcel sets produced exactly 2 737 distinct outlines.

**The emprises cost less than nothing.** The same change stopped fetching the
certificats d'urbanisme the projection had always discarded — 174 662 of the
file's 309 094 rows, two thirds of a central Bordeaux circle — by moving the
exclusion into the ODSQL `where` and asking the portal to COUNT them instead.
Measured on that scan: 416 KB as it shipped without outlines, 1 338 KB with
outlines and certificats, **391 KB with outlines and without them**. ODSQL has
no `<>`, and writing one is not a filter that misses — the export endpoint
answers a syntax error with HTTP 200 and a JSON error object, which reads as a
short answer rather than as a failure.

**A published polygon is not a valid one.** Bordeaux ships its emprises out of
Oracle Spatial with the validator's verdict attached: 428 rows carry a
`geom_err` (`ORA-13349` boundary crosses itself, `13350` rings touch, `13356`
adjacent points redundant) and 108 of those are published with no geometry at
all — those keep their point, and their marker. Dropping the other 320 was
tried and rejected: measured against each row's own `superficie` they draw at a
median 0.997 of their stated area, so the flag is not the test.
`sanitisePolygonParts` in `ringGeometry.js` repairs what is structurally
unrenderable instead — it opens every ring (all 137 916 arrive closed) and
removes consecutive duplicate vertices (45 rings, 187 vertices, across 134 413
rows). It does NOT require a hole to lie inside its outer ring, which was also
written and measured out: none of the file's 1 346 inner rings lies entirely
outside, fourteen lie partly outside because they share an edge with the outer
ring, and the three largest of them are courtyards of 787, 754 and 249 m²
that the rule would have silently filled in.
| `isochrone-fr` | `is` | `/api/isochrone` | IGN Géoplateforme, Valhalla over BD TOPO® — three rings per scan; cycling instead from the FOSSGIS OSRM table over OSM |
| `implantation-fr` | `im` | *(none of its own)* | Fans out across `/api/isochrone`, `/api/filosofi/carreaux`, `/api/gpu`, `/api/dvf` and the BAN reverse geocoder, and joins them in the browser |

`implantation-fr` was the only layer in the app with NO SOURCE OF ITS OWN until
`comparables-fr` joined it below; it is still the only one that composes its
answer entirely out of other people's registers. It
uses the shared address-scan factory's `fetchImpl` seam to fan out across four
routes this server already has — all already cached, all already tested — and
does the spatial join locally: which 200 m carreaux fall inside the reachable
ring. A fifth proxy route would have had to duplicate their load logic
server-side and would have missed their caches. The join reports a BRACKET
rather than a number (squares entirely inside, squares the ring touches, and the
centroid convention between them), because at 200 m a ten-minute walk is mostly
boundary — measured at place Bellecour, 24 of the 35 squares the ring touches
are across its edge. It never scales a square by the fraction inside it: that is
areal interpolation and it assumes an even spread INSEE's imputation flag exists
to deny. The `ficheLines()` output is unit-tested for one thing above all — no
line may contain ' · ', which is the separator `cardFromEntity()` splits on, and
a line carrying one arrives on screen in two halves.

`comparables-fr` is the second layer with no source of its own, and the only one
whose data the READER supplies. It holds one property under study and the
comparables retained against it — DVF mutations picked out of the candidate list
the panel offers within 500 m, and listings keyed in by hand — and it computes
what a valuation note computes. Three things about it are structural rather than
cosmetic. **An asking price and a completed sale are never averaged together**:
two samples, two medians, two silhouettes (`euro` for a mutation, the `tag`
added to `addressMarkerIcons.js` for a listing), and the gap between the two
medians printed as its own line, with both sample sizes beside it and a
sentence refusing the reading a reader would otherwise supply: different
properties, different dates, no temporal adjustment, so not a negotiation
margin.
**The estimate is a quartile range on a named sample**, refused below three
ratio-bearing comparables and told when it is short — never a point estimate,
and never called a confidence interval. **Every exclusion is counted and
printed** (A5): no €/m² without a surface, no €/m² recomputed for a multi-lot
mutation (DVF publishes null there and `dvfFeed.js` measured what dividing
anyway produces), no €/m² outside 300–50 000 €.

It sits on the address-scan shell for one specific mechanism: `setScanPin()`. A
dossier belongs to a property, not to wherever the camera drifted, so posing the
property pins the scan to it — and a pinned scan is exempt from the altitude
ceiling, so the dossier does not vanish when the reader pulls back to see the
city. The candidate sales are deliberately NOT drawn: `dvf-sales` already draws
those same mutations coloured by what they say about the local market, and a
second encoding of the same fact on the same street is A3 broken at the scale of
the map. The pool is a list; the map is the selection.

Its panel is layer-owned and self-mounting (`comparablesPanel.js`, the
`veloPulseHud.js` idiom), so `index.html` carries nothing for it. The dossier is
in `localStorage` under `godsEyeView.comparables.v1` and moves as a file: export
writes our own shape, import accepts either that or a bare JSON array of
listings — which is what an agency's own back-office exports — and MERGES rather
than replaces. Nothing is uploaded anywhere, which is why the share token is
`enabled-only`. The precise version of that claim, which is the one on screen:
prices, surfaces and listing links are never transmitted; the ADDRESS a reader
types goes to `/api/geocode` and to the BAN reverse endpoint because that is
what turns an address into a coordinate, and the property's position goes to
`/api/dvf`. *Rien ne quitte le navigateur* (“Nothing leaves the browser”) was the round version, and an
adversarial pass was right to refuse it. A listing's URL is stored as a link and **never
requested**; `scripts/qa-comparables.mjs` watches every request the page makes
and fails if one reaches the host typed into that field.

`/api/isochrone` (IGN Valhalla over BD TOPO®) WAS a service with no surface —
in the repository since 2026-09-01 and drawn by nothing. It is now the
`isochrone-fr` layer, and it is a point-centred layer for the same reason the
five above are: an isochrone has no meaning without a chosen point, so it scans
around the ground the camera is looking at rather than filling a viewport. The
route takes a COMMA LIST of durations and answers one payload holding every
ring — `seconds=300,600,900` — fetched one at a time upstream, because the
Géoplateforme publishes 5 requests per second per IP with no SLA and an explicit
right to cut a client off. It reports, per consecutive pair of rings, the
measured area growth against the ×4 that free space would give, which is an
obstruction reading that needs no assumed speed.

Three things about that layer changed on 2026-09-02, all of them because the
same complaint kept arriving in different clothes: you could not see the
catchment you had just measured.

**The ceiling follows the mode.** One 8 km ceiling covered a walking ring 1.9 km
across and a driving ring up to 16.5 km across (measured at fifteen minutes over
Ustaritz, Paris 11e, Lyon, Bordeaux and rural Cantal), and Cesium shows about
0.65 × altitude of ground on the short screen axis at nadir — so the layer
cleared its own driving answer off the screen exactly when the reader pulled back
to look at it. The ceilings are now 8 / 20 / 45 km for walking, cycling and
driving, with movement thresholds of 0.25 / 0.6 / 1.5 km to match.

**A click on the globe pins the centre, and a pinned centre has no ceiling at
all.** The ceiling exists to stop a camera-driven layer from spending a request
per nudge across a country; a pin spends nothing when the camera moves, so it has
nothing to protect against. That is what lets a reader pull back far enough to
see a whole driving catchment. The pin is a runtime parameter (`centre`), a chip
releases it back to the camera, and it is deliberately NOT encoded into a share
link — every option in `layerState.js` is an enum and a coordinate is not one.

**Cycling is measured on OpenStreetMap, and drawn as an envelope.** IGN publishes
no cycling profile at any resource — re-probed that day, HTTP 400 on
`bdtopo-valhalla` and `bdtopo-pgr` alike — so the cycling ring comes from one
FOSSGIS OSRM `/table` request: 36 bearings × 11 samples, and each bearing's reach
is where the measured duration crosses the budget. Every vertex is a real routed
duration; the straight line BETWEEN two vertices is not, so the shape cannot
express an unreachable pocket or a catchment in pieces and its area is an upper
bound. It is therefore drawn with a dashed outline, its area is called a
majorant, and the same method run on the walking network and compared against the
IGN walking polygon measured −32 % to +117 % of area across five communes — the
worst case being rural, where the true shape is a spider. All of that is on the
card, not only in this file.

On 2026-09-03 the same complaint came back once more, in the last clothes it
had: a catchment measured, drawn, and then left half under a panel with its own
card painted on top of it.

**A pinned centre is now FRAMED.** The layer solves an altitude that fits the
drawn rings and flies there top-down — nadir because ground metres per pixel is
one number only when the camera looks straight down, and a catchment fitted with
the flat-ground formula at 20° of pitch overshoots by tens of per cent. Heading
is kept, and the screen-axis offsets are rotated into ground axes rather than
the map being turned back to north. The target is not the canvas centre: the
chrome rectangles are read live from `WORLD_OVERLAY_OCCLUDER_SELECTORS` — the
same inventory the card solver prefers to avoid — edge bands are inset past, and
the rings are centred in what is left. Chrome here sits in a GUTTER
(`--left-stack-x: 52px`), so a band is an element that STARTS within a tenth of
the canvas of an edge; the first version required it to touch, matched nothing,
and framed a catchment with a third of it under the panel stack. An element
touching two edges is charged to whichever inset removes less canvas, and one
too wide to inset past is ignored rather than obeyed. `isochroneFraming.js` is
pure and its headline test re-implements the nadir projection to measure where
the shape actually lands.

**The card opens by itself, off the shape.** A band the height of the card is
reserved at the bottom of the frame, and the card is anchored on the catchment's
lower edge instead of on the centre marker — so the leader touches the outline
it describes and no pixel of the wash is underneath. Two additions to the shared
shell make that possible for any layer with a shape around its marker:
`afterDraw`, which runs once the draw is on screen AND indexed (the first moment
a card can be opened), and `cardAnchor`, which moves an open card off its
marker. Both are opt-in and the other five address layers pass neither.

**And the card is titled by the address.** *Point fixé — à pied* (“Pinned
point — on foot”) named the
layer's own state. The proxy reverse-geocodes the pin through the BAN — folded
into the memo that already answered the INSEE code for DVF and Géorisques, so a
mode switch over one pin costs nothing — and the title is the street within
120 m, the commune beyond it with the distance said out loud, and the coordinate
when there is neither. The details were rewritten short for the same reason the
band exists: the card is painted beside a catchment it is reserved out of, so
every character is width the shape does not get. The full expansion sentences
survive on the ring cards, which a reader reaches by asking about one ring.

These five carry the first **two-character** share tokens — `gr`, `dv`, `dp`,
`ur`, `if` — `cadastre-fr` is the sixth, `cd`, and `ads-fr` later took `au`. The single-character space
ran out exactly where this file kept predicting it would: by the time this
branch met main, `0`–`9` and `a`–`y` were all claimed and `z` is the canonical
UNKNOWN token two tests assert on. `cadastre-fr` and `schools-fr` both claimed
`0` on separate branches, and the duplicate-token assertion turned that into a
BOOT failure at the merge rather than a share link that silently enabled the
wrong layer; `schools-fr` kept `0` because it had already shipped and links
carrying it exist, and the unshipped layer moved. Widening
cost nothing on the wire, because `l=` has always been DOT-SEPARATED: `l=f.dv.p`
parses by the same split that read `l=f.7.p`, every link ever issued still
decodes to exactly what it decoded to before, and a two-character token can
never collide with a one-character one. `MAX_ENABLED_LAYERS_CHARS` was raised
from 64 in the same change — it had quietly stopped covering the everything-on
link at 35 layers (69 characters), so sharing every layer at once produced a
link that decoded to `null`; `layerState.test.mjs` now derives that assertion
from the registry instead of a number someone has to remember to update.

**One silhouette per register** (`addressMarkerIcons.js`). All five layers
answer a question about the same building, and drawn as discs they were
indistinguishable from each other on screen. Colour could not carry the source
— DVF spends it on the price ratio, DPE on the official A–G scale, Géorisques
on severity, IDFM on the mode family — so the shape does: **€** for a sale,
**the A–G letter framed** for a diagnostic, a **hazard triangle**, a **plan
sheet**, and the **mode pictogram** (reused from `transitVehicleIcons.js`,
because a stop is signed in the street with its mode's own symbol). The DPE
marker being the label itself means a grade is readable without a click.

Glyphs are SVG data URIs, cached per kind and raster size, drawn as white
line-art over a dark halo and carrying no hue of their own — Cesium multiplies
`billboard.color` into the texture, so white takes the value colour exactly
while black survives the multiply. That is the same tint-safe discipline
`sharedMobilityIcons.js` and `transitVehicleIcons.js` record, and it is why one
image per shape serves every colour. Drawn here rather than vendored from
Material Symbols: that pack was taken for vehicles because a tram in plan view
is hard to invent recognisably, which is not true of a euro sign, so these
carry no third-party licence obligation. `scripts/qa-address-layers.mjs` proves
no two registers ever resolve to the same image, and that clicking a billboard
still opens its card — a billboard is not a point, and pickability had to be
re-measured rather than assumed.

**Markers are seated on the rendered terrain, not on the ellipsoid.**
`Cartesian3.fromDegrees(lon, lat)` places a marker at height 0, and the globe
draws avenue de France at 79–83 m of ellipsoidal height — so every marker sat
eighty metres under its own street, painted anyway because depth testing is
disabled. Under an oblique camera a vertical error is a HORIZONTAL error on
screen, and one that changes with the camera pose: measured at 700 m and −35°,
a DVF dot landed 83 px from its address, and turning 40° moved the error
sideways. The dots therefore slid across the city as the camera moved. Every
marker is now placed at `globe.getHeight()` — the height of the terrain
triangle actually being rendered, the same call `bdtopoBuildings.js` uses — and
re-seated when terrain finishes streaming (`tileLoadProgressEvent`) and when
the camera settles, because the LOD under a point refines as you fly toward it.
While terrain has not answered for a marker, the scan centre's height stands in
for it and `getStats().seatPending` says so. `scripts/qa-address-layers.mjs`
measures the residual offset in pixels from two camera poses; a unit test
covers the seating arithmetic. Clamped polylines carry no `position` and are
skipped — they were already on the ground.

A height probe is paid **per coordinate, not per mark** (`renderedSurface.js`).
Coincident marks are the normal case rather than the edge case, and the budget
is 24 probes a pass: the DPE layer used to hand it 200 badges carrying 14
distinct coordinates, one of them carrying 42, so the whole budget went on
fourteen questions asked fourteen different numbers of times and dozens of
marks were still on the fallback height six passes later. Readings taken in one
pass are shared by every mark at the same coordinate to 1e-7 degrees (~11 mm),
including the one-shot latch — the same ground is the same reading whoever
bought it. It is a per-pass shortcut, not a cache with a lifetime.

**The DPE layer draws BUILDINGS, not diagnostics** (`dpeSites.js`, since
2026-09-14). It is the only one of the five whose register answers many rows
per address — a block of flats produces one diagnostic per sale — and drawing
one badge per row put 200 marks on 14 pixels, made the card a lottery between
forty-two flats, and exhausted the seating budget described above. The served
rows are grouped into SITES: by the building the register names (`id_rnb`), by
the BAN address when it names none, by the bare coordinate when it has neither.
An address whose identified rows all name the SAME building lends that
identifier to its unidentified rows (111 of 200 rows carry one, 135 after the
loan); an address that names TWO buildings lends neither, because that is a
courtyard building behind a street one and choosing between them would be a
coin flip dressed as a record.

Each site draws its **footprint**, from the RNB's published `shape`, washed in
its own mode letter at alpha 0.26 and outlined — clamped to whichever surface
is being drawn, so on the photoreal stack the tint climbs the facades and the
answer to "which building is this" is a whole building lit in its colour, with
`Bâti 3D` switched off. Under it the **cadastral parcel** is drawn as a dashed
achromatic line and never as a wash: the colour channel is spent on the seven
official letters, and a DPE says nothing about land. The badge stands on the
footprint's own label anchor — the midpoint of its longest interior chord, not
its centroid, which for a building around a courtyard lands in the courtyard.

Both shapes are resolved SERVER-SIDE by the `/api/dpe` proxy, six RNB calls in
flight at a time plus one cadastre box shared with the `cadastre-fr` proxy's
own snapped-box cache; measured 5.9 s cold and 0.39 s once that box is warm,
against 10 sites. Neither upstream can withhold the diagnostics — a site with
no shape keeps its badge and its card, and `getStats()` publishes `sites`,
`sitesOutlined`, `sitesParcelled`, `sitesUnplaceable` and `sitesOverBudget`
rather than implying every address got an outline. Three marks, one subject: a
click on the wash, on its outline or on the parcel line selects the site's
BADGE, through the shell's `selectionFor` hook — a clamped polygon has no size
to grow and no colour to take, so without the redirect a reader clicked a
building, got the right card, and saw nothing change.

Measured on the live app, 1400 × 900, nadir at 420 m, before and after:
200 badges → 10, worst height error 25.2 m → 0.0 m, worst screen offset
25.5 px → 0.0 px, worst slide across a 250 m pan **72.6 px → 0.0 px**.
`scripts/qa-dpe-sites.mjs` recomputes all of it, plus the thing that caused it
(how many badges share a coordinate) and the card's four placement sentences.

**Urbanisme answers a BLOCK below 1 500 m and a POINT above it.** It is the one
layer of the five whose question depends on the camera as well as on where the
camera points, because its own question is about the plot OPPOSITE: "could the
car park across the street become twenty-five metres of construction?" cannot
be answered by a query about the ground underfoot. Below
`GPU_BOX_MAX_ALTITUDE_M` the zoning half is asked for over a box around the
camera's ground point — `focusedViewBox`, clipped to the view so nothing off
screen is fetched, capped at `GPU_MAX_BOX_DEG` (0.02°, the cadastre's number
for the cadastre's reason: at twice that side Paris answers 243 zones and
1.2 MB against 52 and 405 KB). The gate is ALTITUDE, never the span of the view
rectangle, which on a tilted camera reaches the horizon. Above it, the point
regime is unchanged.

The EASEMENT half is always a point, and one measurement decides it: a 390 m
box over Lyon's Presqu'île answers 210 easement features and 2.3 MB. At the
zoning ceiling, upstream / on the wire / entities: Lyon point 725 KB / 409 KB /
153, full box 4 004 KB / 1 823 KB / 1 182, hybrid 888 KB / 506 KB / 218.

It costs bytes, not frames. Measured on the shipped build over IGN ortho in
both regimes: median frame 0.6–1.4 ms, worst frame after a redraw 1.4–2.2 ms,
zero frames over 16 ms. `zone-urba` carries the SAME silent 5 000-feature cap
as `cadastre/parcelle` — a 0.40° Paris box returns 5 000 of 17 182 at HTTP 200
— so a box over it is refused whole and the true count printed; at 0.02° the
densest measured box answers 55 zones.

`atPoint` marks the zone under the operator, and WHO decides it depends on who
was asked. Under a point query APIcarto has already answered — every returned
feature intersects that point by construction — so the flag is simply true.
Under a box query the layer decides, against the ring as PUBLISHED and never
the one it draws: Ustaritz's `UB` ring is 521 vertices decimated to 400, and
the coordinate the service itself answers `UB` for falls outside the decimated
ring. Each zone also carries a label anchor — the midpoint of its longest
interior chord, not its centroid, which for a zone shaped like a meander or a
ring around a hamlet lands outside the zone entirely — and its code is written
on the ground there, because hue gives the family but not `UB` against `UYc`.

The shell rescans when the QUERY changes, not only when the scan centre moves
250 m: zooming straight down through the box altitude moves the centre by
nothing while changing the kind of answer that belongs on screen.

**A PLU zone is not a place, it is a rule over an area,** so `urbanisme-gpu` is
also the one address layer that fills: each zone is a translucent, ground-classified wash with its
interior rings CUT OUT, and the stroke on top of it. The wash says where, the
stroke says exactly where — and the enclave is the part that matters. The
projection kept outer rings only until 2026-09-01, on the reasoning that a hole
in an outline is invisible; it is, and it is the entire point of a fill.
Measured at Ustaritz: the `UB` zone under the village centre is one polygon
with two interior rings, 6 646 m² the same document zones `UE` and 50 686 m²
it zones `UYc`, so the filled-without-holes version painted 57 332 m² of ground
with a rule that does not reach it. Rings are spent out of the vertex budget
WITH the ring they perforate, so a hole is never what a budget drops.

`typezone` carries SEVEN values and the colour table had four. A census over
twelve APIcarto boxes on 2026-09-01 — 4 216 zoning features — found **zero
occurrences of plain `AU`**: every future urban (*à urbaniser*) zone publishes `AUc` (open under
the PLU as it stands) or `AUs` (closed until the document is modified or
revised), so the family this layer exists for was the one drawn in the
unknown-value grey. Both are now coloured, `AUs` cooled and quieter, and
`Ah`/`Nh` take their family's hue brightened. Fill weights were measured rather
than chosen: differenced against an unpainted frame over an IGN orthophoto,
0.18 moved the picture by a mean of 3/255 in red and was invisible, which is
why the shipped ladder runs 0.22 (`A`/`N`) to 0.42 (`AUc`). Servitudes stay
lines and are DASHED — they are not zoning, and one measured `pm1` envelope is
759 polygons spanning kilometres, so a wash of it tints the view, not a plot.

More than one zone under one point is not a bug and `zoneCount` reports it: on
a 35 m grid over a 9 × 6 km box around Ustaritz, 17 of 34 126 points fall in
two zoning polygons, every one at a commune limit where two independently
digitised PLU documents overlap — 73 polygon pairs and 5,3 ha in that box
alone.

**A click anywhere on that ground answers for that ground.** `urbanisme-gpu` is
the only address layer with a `groundCard` — the other four describe things
STANDING on the ground (a sale, a diagnostic, a hazard record) and those have
addresses, while a zoning rule and an easement are properties of the plot
itself. Clicking the wash, an outline, or the bare globe between them resolves
the coordinate geometrically (`groundPick.js`: rendered terrain, then the depth
buffer, then the ellipsoid — `scene.pick` is used only to say WHOSE click it
is, because classification geometry answers a pick with whichever shadow volume
the ray enters first) and reads the answer out of the payload already in hand.
No request, no wait, and it works on the plot OPPOSITE — which is the plot the
layer exists for. Measured at Ustaritz at 900 m: four clicks across one screen
answer `UB`, `UA`, `A` and `UB`. The scan marker keeps its own card, which is
the scan-level summary; every other click is a question about a point.

The answer is read off the DRAWN shapes, and within 30 m of the marker it
deliberately is not: those shapes are decimated by up to 96%, and at the scan
point the register has already answered — `atPoint` for the zoning, and every
easement in the payload by construction, since that half is always a point
query. So near the marker the register wins and the geometry is not consulted;
further out the drawn map answers and the card says its outlines are
simplified. The card also distinguishes the four ways a point can have no zoning
— the answer was refused whole, the box never covered this spot, the camera is
above 1 500 m so only the marker was asked about, or the published document
genuinely stops here — because printing *aucun zonage* (“no zoning”) for all
four would report three of this layer's own limits as facts about the plot.
Easement absence is worded the same way: *aucune servitude à ce point* (“no
easement at this point”) only where the register answered that point, and
*aucune des N servitudes du repère n'atteint ce point* (“none of the marker's N
easements reaches this point”) everywhere else.

**One row, two registers, and since 2026-09-14 two switches.** The row carries
a chip per half — *Zonage PLU* (PLU zoning) and *Servitudes* (Easements) — and they are independent
rather than a three-state selector, because "zoning only", "easements only" and
"both" are three questions a reader actually has. Over a village centre the
wash covers every square metre of the block and the dashed envelopes run across
it, and the only way to see under one used to be to switch off the answer
entirely. Both are `drawOnlyParams`: one request carries both halves — 1,4 MB at
the measured worst case — so hiding one rebuilds the entities from the payload
in hand and spends neither a request nor a rate-limit slot. The chips govern
the GEOMETRY and nothing else: the scan marker and every ground card keep the
whole register answer, and the marker's card names what is hidden (*zonage
masqué sur la carte*, “zoning hidden on the map”) so five easements listed over a bare photograph read as a
switched-off half rather than as a broken layer. Turning both off is allowed and
leaves the marker, so a row that is ON never draws nothing. The key follows the
chips — a swatch for a shape nobody can see is the same defect as a key for a
dormant scan — and the marker falls back to the easement red, then to neutral,
rather than wearing a zone hue the key no longer decodes. **The key itself had
never once painted**: it arrived in #78 declaring `rowControls(payload)` in the
very commit that moved the shell to `rowControls(runtime, summary, payload)` —
the two halves of a rebase — so the family tally ran over the runtime object and
every scan published an empty key: eight zoning families painted on the ground
with nothing anywhere to decode them.

Because the wash is ground-classification geometry, and a classification
surface is read once when the primitive is BUILT, `urbanisme-gpu` is also the
one address layer that sets `redrawOnMapStack`. Switching to the photoreal
tileset hides the globe, and a wash addressed to terrain then draws nothing at
all — the layer reads as switched off. It rebuilds from the payload already in
hand, with no request and no rate limit spent.

#### Ambient labels are a click surface (September 2026)

The name floating above an object on the globe now selects that object, exactly
as its dot does. It did not before, and the reason was mechanical rather than a
policy: the shared world overlay paints every label onto a
`pointer-events: none` canvas stacked over the Cesium viewport, so
`scene.pick()` under a label returns whatever is behind it — usually the globe,
i.e. nothing. A click aimed at a station's name therefore read as *empty space*
and DISMISSED the selection, which is the opposite of the intent. And the name
is what people aim at: it is what says which river or which yard this is, and
it is five to twenty times the target area of the 5–15 px dot it belongs to.

The host already had the two halves — entries flagged `interactive` publish a
screen-space hit rectangle each painted frame, and `hitTestWorldOverlay()`
resolves the topmost one. What was missing was the resolution step in each
layer's click handler. `src/data/overlayLabelPick.js` is that step written once:
it fences the hit test to the asking layer's own overlay source, strips the
entry-id prefix each layer publishes under, and re-checks the id against the
layer's live record map — hit rectangles are pooled and published per painted
frame, so one can name a record that left the viewport a frame ago, and that is
a miss rather than a selection.

**The resolution order is the load-bearing part, and it is the same everywhere:**

1. `scene.pick()` — a native primitive under the cursor wins. Labels float
   above their anchor, so the two rarely overlap; when they do, the thing the
   depth buffer says you are pointing at is the honest answer, and it is also
   the one the pick registry can arbitrate between layers.
2. the label plane, which the depth buffer knows nothing about.
3. only then, empty space → clear the selection.

Putting the label test first would let a label drawn across a NEIGHBOURING
object's dot steal that object's click.

Wired into twelve layers: **Hub'Eau Gauges**, **Réseau électrique**, **Réseau
gaz**, **Production RTE**, **Centrales hydro**, **Événements routiers**,
**Écoles (FR)** and **Bornes IRVE (FR)** (both on their département names at
national altitude), **Radio** (station names only — a cluster badge names a
count, not a station), **Câbles sous-marins** (whose stem tip is a 7 px dot at
the end of a hairline, often out over open ocean), **Satellites** (the ISS
label, where the point is a few pixels of a target moving at orbital speed) and
**Rocket Launches** (the ambient mission markers). Selected-object CARDS stay
non-interactive: a card names what is already selected, so a rectangle there
would do nothing but cover the ambient labels behind it.

Layers deliberately left alone: Vigicrues, Météo-France Vigilance, the
earthquakes, the marine buoys, Mix élec and the transit routes all paint ambient labels
but have no selection to trigger — a click surface with nothing behind it would
be a lie. Mobilité partagée, Transit (FR), État du réseau and Bâti 3D publish
only selected-object cards and no ambient labels, so there is nothing to make
clickable.

Hub'Eau is the layer the request came from and the one where the gap was
widest: its dots draw at `disableDepthTestDistance: 2500` against siblings that
use infinity, so the click handler already has to `drillPick` eight deep just
to find its own dot under a charging point — while the name beside it was inert.
Its ambient label carries the same `hubeau:<code>` id as the dot, so one string
identifies a station across the drill pick, the overlay hit test and the pick
registry, and the label branch resolves straight into the existing
`selectObject()`.

Proved in a real scene by `npm run qa:label-click`, which reads where the host
painted a label, dispatches a real pointer event at its centre — nowhere near
the dot — and asserts the layer's selection changed; and that a click on empty
space still clears it, on the layers that have ever had a deselect branch.

**A paint lane can now publish its own click surfaces (September 2026).** An
ordinary entry gets its hit rectangle for free, because the host lays it out and
therefore knows where it landed. The DETECT overlay is not an entry source: it
solves callout placement against its own collision arbiter and hands the host
nothing but pixels, so its callsigns could only ever be scenery. That was the
widest gap of all — a contact's sprite is a few pixels of a target at 900 km/h,
the callsign beside it is several times that area, so it is what people aim at,
and every one of those clicks fell onto the globe and DESELECTED the aircraft
being followed. `publishWorldOverlayLaneRect()` is the seam that closes it:
same hit-rectangle buffer, same `hitTestWorldOverlay()` resolution, same
one-frame lifetime, re-stated on every painted frame exactly like the text
itself. Callouts fainter than 20 % alpha publish nothing — a rectangle over text
nobody can read is a trap, not a target.

The scope is **per layer**, `detect:<layerId>` (`detectionLabelSourceId()`):
civil and military aircraft share one lane, and a handler that hit-tested the
lane as a whole would resolve its neighbour's callsign as one of its own
contacts. **Vols** and **Vols militaires** consult it, in the same three-step
order as everything else, and select the contact the callsign names.

**What the four bundled packs draw is bounded by TWO screen rules, not by the
horizon (September 2026).** Until `localGeojson.js` gained them, the only
spatial question it asked was `EllipsoidalOccluder` — is this point beyond the
horizon — which is a hemisphere, not a viewport: measured before the change, at
120 km over Lyon with all four packs on, **10 178 of 22 218 features were
`show = true`**, ten thousand of them on the far side of Europe, Africa or the
Atlantic and never once on screen. (1) A **frustum gate** now hides anything
whose whole drawn extent is outside the view volume, sized on a bounding sphere
that reaches from the ground anchor out over the recall stem — which is 65 px
on screen at every range, so ~1 670 km of world at orbit — plus the surveyed
footprint and the runway segments at their maximum stretch. It is deliberately
generous, and it fails OPEN: a scene that cannot describe its frustum culls
nothing. (2) Above **2 000 km of camera height** a **screen-cell budget** keeps
one mark per occupied 26 px cell, ranked by the same priority comparator the
ambient cards use so a name never lands on a dot that is not its own, capped at
600 marks per pack, and with the SELECTED feature always pinned so pulling back
to orbit never deletes the thing under an open card. Below 2 000 km the budget
is not applied at all — a visitor at city range zoomed in to separate two
neighbouring structures. Both answers are re-decided only on a camera settle,
like the marker range and the footprint floor beside them, and both follow the
`lite` render profile (60 % of the marks, grid widened by `1/√0.6` because a
grid loses cells with the SQUARE of its pitch). Cesium's own leftovers went with
them: the pack no longer keeps the **pin billboard** Cesium builds for every
POINT feature (16 834 of them, each drawn under the app's own dot) nor the HTML
**description table** its default `describe` renders per feature (22 218 of
them, 1 995 276 characters on the ports pack alone) — neither was ever read.
`npm run perf:infra` is the bench that holds all of this to a number.

**Airport names select and frame, exactly as their pastille does.** The local
infrastructure layers (**Aéroports**, **Ports**, **Barrages & digues**, **Datacenters**)
publish an ambient CARD carrying the feature's name at the tip of a recall stem
whose marker is a few pixels wide; the card was `interactive: false`, so the
larger of the two targets did nothing. It is now the same click as the marker —
selection, Context, and the 5 000 m framing flight. Its label branch yields to a
sibling local layer's own entity and to any pick the registry says another layer
owns — but NOT to an unclaimed pick, and that distinction is what makes the
feature work at all: over a loaded photoreal tileset almost every on-globe pixel
picks a 3D tile feature that no layer owns and nobody can select, so treating a
non-null `scene.pick()` as "occupied" would have left every name on the globe
inert again.

### Context / Contacts coordinator (July 2026)

- The internal Context coordinator is available in every visual style. Its dedicated right-side `CONTEXT` chooser exposes the neutral shell; the coordinator is not duplicated in Data Layers and does not enable a live-data dependency until a mode is selected.
- The expanded `CONTEXT` view offers mutually exclusive `CONTACTS` and `SPACE MISSIONS` modes. Selecting `CONTACTS` enables the context-owned Flights, Military Flights, AIS Vessels, and Mapped Installations dependencies only when they are not already user-enabled; selecting `SPACE MISSIONS` enables the recent-launch layer and its Satellite dependency. `CONTACTS` cycles the nearest supported contact of whatever type is selected. Satellites are deliberately excluded from those Awareness cohorts and keep their own tracking UX. Selecting the active mode again returns to the neutral chooser and releases only mode-owned dependencies.
- If a civilian or military aircraft is already tracked when `CONTACTS` becomes operational, that source-owned track is adopted as the Context subject before nearest-contact autofocus. Context rechecks the tracker after its dependencies settle, so a newer selection wins, while an explicit clear during activation prevents fallback from silently selecting a replacement. Cockpit entry remains unavailable until that Context transaction has settled, so its camera takeover cannot clear Cesium tracking before adoption. Adoption does not recreate tracking or transfer camera ownership; it initializes the normal 250 km ring, history, proximity results, and Cockpit Previous/Next state for the original aircraft.
- Mapped installations arrive from Overpass as ways and relations carrying a
  bounding box rather than a centre — `out center tags geom` honours only the
  last geometry mode, so `center` is never emitted. A feature with no explicit
  point is placed at the midpoint of that box; an inverted, antimeridian-spanning
  or implausibly wide box is refused rather than averaged. Measured over
  Strasbourg on 2026-09-09: 21 elements returned, 2 of which carry a point of
  their own.
- Clicking a mapped installation selects it; clicking it again, clicking empty
  map, or clicking a contact this layer does not own releases the selection and
  clears only this layer's shared context, leaving a sibling layer's freshly
  picked contact intact — the same rule CCTV world clicks follow. A later
  repaint (a debounced refetch, a ground floor resolving) yields to any newer
  selection made elsewhere instead of repainting its own former site.
- The layer holds OpenStreetMap only. The `SEARCH NEARBY SITES` button and its one user-initiated Google Maps Places text search for “military installation” were removed on 2026-09-10: Places has no military type, so every result was classified by NAME alone and drawn as an unverified candidate that vanished at the next camera move. Nothing on this layer is now sourced from anything but a mapped OSM tag.
- The expanded desktop header omits the redundant `ON` label; the active mode button carries state. Expanded Contact results also omit the duplicate `GLOBAL CONTEXT` / `CONTEXT ONLY` status row and begin with the selected subject and its 250 km scope. Global Context does not fabricate a selected-entity model preview: the provisional hand-authored aircraft wireframe was removed because it was not geometry extracted from the selected entity's actual asset.
- Dependency ownership is reversible: disabling Global Context releases only dependencies it enabled, while user-enabled layers remain on. This also removes the Military-layer suppression handoff when Global Context owned Military, allowing an already-enabled civilian Flights layer to resume its normal mixed rendering. If OpenSky is unavailable and has no last-good cache, Flights requests a capped 250 nm adsb.lol point snapshot around the current view anchor and labels that provenance explicitly; it never relabels military-feed rows as civilian data. If both inputs fail, Flights remains `UNKNOWN`.
- Space Missions is replay-isolated: Rocket Launches and Satellites are the only Data Layers permitted while the mode is active. Direct UI and voice entry capture the same pre-entry snapshot; internal dependency and restoration enables do not create a user-owned Context session. Entry waits for incompatible layers to shut down, direct incompatible enables are blocked before lifecycle work, and the entry gate remains active through the complete Rocket Launches enable. A newer same-target ON request takes ownership of the pending entry without releasing its isolation snapshot, including when it arrives while the prior request is awaiting the adoption guard. A caller abort, resource cancellation, newer OFF, or layer teardown waits for exact manager settlement and restores that snapshot without resurrecting Rocket Launches. If an abort lands after only part of a restore settles, Context completes the same exact target without the stale caller signal and then replays newer explicit layer intent. Dedicated Voice Context cancellation reports a stable cancelled result plus the current Context state; generic layer visibility additionally exposes manager phase, reason, successor, and lifecycle details. Once an exact voice visibility intent commits, a newer voice turn cannot relabel it as cancelled while Context settlement completes; pre-commit aborts remain cancellable and final lifecycle mismatches remain failures. Clear Selected Layers reserves its complete captured OFF set before sequential teardown; a newer absolute request of any origin supersedes only its layer reservation and remains authoritative. A rejected layer teardown retains the truthful enabled state, rolls already-stopped siblings back to the captured pre-entry set, and aborts replay; rapid exit/re-entry serializes the full Satellite enabled-state and parameter restore before a new snapshot is taken. Contacts remains additive and restores user-enabled layers normally.
- Enabled Data Layer controls report normalized feed health on the button (`LOADING`, `DEGRADED`, `STALE`, `FALLBACK`, or `UNAVAILABLE`) while the metadata line retains the source and reason. A partial CelesTrak group failure keeps the usable catalog and reports `DEGRADED`; a total outage keeps last-good catalog data visible but reports `UNAVAILABLE`.
- On activation it focuses the nearest currently observed aircraft across the civilian and military feeds, with military winning an exact distance tie; if none are available, it focuses an observed AIS vessel. The aircraft search is deliberately uncapped and one refresh-tick retry handles initially empty feeds. This is an attention-priority navigation shortcut, not a high-risk, affiliation, or threat classification.
- A selected aircraft, AIS vessel, or mapped installation gets a 250 km **context window** with nearby cohort counts, nearest examples, source labels, and stale/unavailable reasons. It emits `NEARBY` or `UNKNOWN`; no detection, engagement, affiliation, or sensor-activity conclusion is calculated.
- For a selected live aircraft or vessel, the context window refreshes from the existing tracker/feed position every 750 ms, so nearest distances and cohort counts follow the subject without introducing a duplicate poll loop.
- Aircraft cohort membership uses every locally loaded, selectable contact inside the 250 km window, including a plane hidden only by horizon culling or because its 3D model owns the visual. Counts and navigation therefore do not change with the current camera angle or billboard/model handoff.
- Nearby examples in the context panel are focus controls: they use their owning layer's existing selection/tracking path, then frame that contact. Static-installation distances use ellipsoidal surface distance so the count matches the ground-projected context disk.
- Context selection transfers camera ownership by subject type: selecting a civilian or military flight keeps that layer's moving follow camera, while selecting an AIS vessel or mapped installation first releases any prior aircraft tracker and performs only the source layer's one-time framing. The camera therefore remains user-controlled after non-aircraft selection instead of continuing to move with the previously selected plane.
- Selected AIS vessels use their layer-owned full-detail presentation model in the shared world-overlay host; mapped installations use the tracked-readout aesthetic. Both remain crisp above post-processing without duplicate selected labels; non-selected AIS cards retain their source-owned grid/visibility selection and are host-batched with other world cards.
- Space Mission ascent replay uses the compact rocket/thrust overlay only through orbit insertion. Once the replay enters its orbit phase, that vehicle glyph is replaced by a fixed-size cyan dot following the same orbit path and callout.
- While a subject is selected, an inner keyhole compass rotates against camera heading and up to three cyan shafted bearing arrows lock to its single faint tick-marked rim, with their labels inset just inside the circle. Labels explicitly separate the geographic bearing (`BRG`) from the contact's reported course (`CRS`) so the pointer direction is not confused with aircraft heading. They point toward the nearest observed/mapped examples; each cohort displays up to ten examples while retaining the complete locally loaded in-range cohort for navigation, with three visible at a time and a ten-second page rotation shared by the panel and arrows. This distinct neutral-context color avoids implying that all context indicators are military-flight symbols. `PREVIOUS`, `FOCUS`, and `NEXT` controls navigate selection history or the next nearby cohort example through the existing tracker. NEXT uses a cycle-scoped visited set and starts a deterministic new walk after exhausting the current candidates instead of re-admitting the nearest visited contact.
- Installations are viewport-bounded OSM map features (`military=airfield|naval_base|range|barracks|base` and `landuse=military`), capped to a 10° non-dateline request and 700 upstream features. The proxy caches five minutes and serves a one-hour stale fallback. Empty, stale, unavailable, and zoom-too-wide states remain visibly distinct.
- The selected-only visual is one static, unfilled blue circle. It marks the 250 km proximity context window only; it is not coverage or a radar/weapon envelope. Missing broadcasts and unmapped sites are explicitly not evidence of absence.
- The right rail's collapsed Display, CCTV, and Context controls use the same compact sizing language as the left rail's collapsed Data Layers and Scenes controls. These compact-state widths do not constrain expanded panel or child-content widths.

### Motion & Symbology Correctness (June 10, 2026)

- **Flights (commercial + military)** render one poll interval behind real time (30s/15s) and interpolate between two known feed-stamped fixes (OpenSky `time_position`; adsb.lol `receipt − seen_pos`). The display latency is an intentional product decision — do not "fix" it away. The whole fleet dead-reckons at ~12Hz (1m² write gating); aircraft get a 3-poll grace period (faded icon) before removal. When a position epoch pauses, both layers coast for at least 60 seconds of contact grace with an absolute five-minute ceiling. Source backoff marks each contact and the cockpit `STALE`; the cockpit then holds the exact layer position instead of continuing inertial flight. Repeated-position kinematic changes create a forward-only synthetic fix rather than mutating history, and grounded history is lifted only when no owned 3D model already controls its datum. A nominally successful worldwide OpenSky response whose own snapshot epoch is more than two minutes old prefers the existing 250-nm viewport-scoped adsb.lol fallback and labels the source/coverage accordingly when that upstream is available. If the fallback is also unavailable, the layer's freshness/error fields use the source epoch—never the cache receipt time—so the UI reports an old snapshot rather than “just now.”
- **World-space headings at every angle** (`src/data/iconOrientation.js`): aircraft/vessel icon rotation uses the camera right/up basis per tick (alignedAxis always ZERO), which is exact at screen center and for orthographic/nadir views and remains stable through >180° tracked orbits. Perspective rays vary across the viewport, so off-center contacts at oblique pitch can diverge from an exact finite-difference window projection; a regression test pins that known regime, and field evidence decides whether to adopt exact projection with the basis method as fallback. Fleet rotations refresh on camera-pose change; tracked entities per frame. Billboards are horizon-culled via a shared EllipsoidalOccluder.
- **Military/OpenSky reconciliation** (`src/data/militaryRegistry.js`): known-military ICAOs render amber in the flights layer (60s self-poll of the cached mil endpoint when the military layer is off) and are suppressed there while the military layer renders them.
- **Satellites**: 838-sat core catalog (stations/visual/GPS/GLONASS/Galileo/GEO), tracking lands ~726km out via `viewFrom` (tracked entity owns a point graphic so the tracking camera engages), rings realign via primitive modelMatrix (no per-second rebuild flicker), optional `setParams({catalog:'dense'})` Starlink mode.
- **Satellite classes** (`src/data/satelliteClass.js`): every satellite is classified from the CelesTrak group it was ingested with — no extra fetch and no heuristics — into STATION (warm white), NAV (cyan; GPS/GLONASS/Galileo deliberately share one color so the GNSS family reads as one thing), GEO (violet), VISUAL (muted blue-gray catch-all), and STARLINK (dim slate, the broadband shell only). That module is the single source of truth for class, label, and color, so the dot, the card, and the legend swatch cannot disagree. Two deliberate palette rules: no class may sit in the 40–48° amber band, which is the app-wide known-military convention; and STARLINK stays far below VISUAL in Rec.601 luminance so the shell stays separable when NVG/FLIR collapse the scene to one channel. The ISS keeps its long-standing red hero dot rather than the STATION color — it carries a permanent name label and its card still reads `STATION · ISS`. `satelliteClassOf` is the single owner of that ISS rule, so the card label and the legend tally can never disagree: during a stations-feed outage the ISS is ingested as `visual`, and both surfaces still file it under STATION.
- Class is also a **text field**, not just a color: `NAV · GPS` / `GEO` / `STARLINK` / `STATION · ISS` leads the tracked card's detail block and replaces the raw CelesTrak tag on the detection-overlay label. Because that canvas composites above the post-FX chain, the class stays readable in NVG/FLIR after the in-scene dot colors are flattened.
- The satellites row in DATA LAYERS carries per-layer sub-controls (`DataLayerManager._syncRowControls`, the first consumer of the optional `getRowControls()` layer hook): a **DENSE** chip exposing the existing `catalog` param. The per-class swatch counts it also used to print inline are published through the same `getRowControls().legend`, but painted only on the map key. Default is the sparse core catalog. The chip is stateless — it declares the params to apply and the manager owns the write — so the Space Missions capture/restore path over the same param stays authoritative. Controls stay hidden while the layer is off. An explicit CORE or DENSE choice participates in versioned local and share-link state; temporary Space Missions overrides do not.
- **The STARLINK chip reports the dense LOAD, not the catalog param.** The param flips synchronously while the Starlink shell takes seconds to arrive over a chunked load, and CelesTrak 502s that feed regularly. So the chip reads `STARLINK ···` (busy, disabled) while loading, ACTIVE only once dense points are actually on screen, and `STARLINK ✕` with the reason on hover when the load fails — a failure also reverts `catalog` to `core`, drops any partial chunk, and leaves the chip clickable to retry. A load is judged by points added, not by HTTP status: a 200 carrying an empty body, a passed-through HTML error page, or only TLEs the core catalog already owns fails with the same revert semantics as a 502. Any explicit request for `core` clears a latched error even when the mode does not change, so a Space Missions restore of an already-core snapshot never leaves the user with a failure they did not cause. Because the load settles asynchronously, the layer pushes a re-render through the optional `setRowControlsListener()` hook; nothing else would repaint that row before the 5-minute catalog refresh, so the count and legend would otherwise sit stale.
- **A dependency owner takes the row with it.** Space Missions borrows this layer for TLE lookup with `showPoints:false`; while points are hidden the layer returns empty row controls, so the legend never describes an empty sky and the chip cannot accept a write that the owner's restore would silently revert.
- The detection-overlay record cache (`_detectionObjects`) is cleared with the catalog on every rebuild: it stamps id/class at creation only, and a rebuild can re-tag a satellite when a partial CelesTrak outage changes which group wins dedupe.
- **FIRMS**: no ground clamping (zero 3D-tiles height sampling), ≤18 screen-decluttered ambient labels, click-to-inspect detail card, 2.5k/3k sprite budgets viewport-clipped by FRP.
- **CCTV v2 foundation:** a pitched
  frustum wireframe (4 corner rays + far-cap rectangle) with a monitor plane at the frustum's
  far cap, retargeting the existing video/canvas texture pipeline. Manual calibration only —
  auto-calibration and the drape mesh pipeline are deleted. A one-shot activation obstruction
  probe (`pickFromRay` on camera activation, clamping the plane short of the first hit) remains;
  ground placement is superseded by the shared-floor v3 behavior below. Calibration persists to
  `godsEyeView.cctv.calibration.v2` (wiped clean, no v1 import); a panel-only CAL badge shows
  `CALIBRATED`/`CURATED`/`RAW PRIOR` (no in-world tint). Panel is titled "CCTV" (not "CCTV
  MESH"). Staggered geometry/frame loading is active-first and uses 4 records per 120 ms normally,
  or 2 per 250 ms while tracking/cockpit owns the view (re-evaluated each batch), with coalesced progress
  notifications (roughly 300 ms or ten batches; natural completion and disable each publish their
  terminal state through their own completion paths) and a LOADING FRAMES
  chip and the preview-first auto-expanding panel are unchanged. Coverage polylines are created
  lazily instead of inserting five entities for every catalog camera during initialization: default
  COVERAGE ON enable creates the active/visible 14-camera cohort, and activation always creates the
  selected frustum even with COVERAGE OFF. **Field validation passed
  2026-07-04** (core look + downtown no-clip confirmed); that round fixed three findings: the
  ground clamp now lifts the cap *center* only so the wireframe stays a true pyramid welded to
  the plane (was a flattened fan / the ~47.5 m divergence — RESOLVED), re-selecting the active
  camera is a no-op (killed a click-flash), and texture swaps gate on canvas content (killed a
  periodic white flash). Coverage is now **metro-wide: 250 cameras** (`CCTV_AUSTIN_MAX_SOURCES`
  default 36 → 250, hard bound 300), filtered to `camera_status === TURNED_ON` (~815 live of
  1,003 rows). City packs (2026-07-04): Caltrans (districts 4/7/11/3 — SF, LA, San Diego,
  Sacramento; cap 300) and TfL London JamCams (cap 250) join Austin (cap 250) as keyless default
  sources — ~800 cameras total, all RAW PRIOR poses, stills-first. The Métropole de Lyon
  "Caméras Web Criter" pack (2026-08-26; keyless `data.grandlyon.com` catalog, cap 60,
  `CCTV_LYON_ENABLED=0` disables) adds the ~15 published Lyon traffic cameras: frames from
  the Métropole's own host, kept only while their `last_update` stamp keeps moving (the
  catalog's only decommissioned-camera signal). The catalog names a destination rather than
  a bearing, so 14 of the 15 carry a **CURATED** heading hand-derived from OSM road geometry
  plus the published frames (`GRANDLYON_CURATED_HEADINGS`), not a RAW PRIOR hash; the
  monitor-plane cap lands a median 6 m from the watched carriageway against 30 m for the
  hash. The fifteenth publishes an "image unavailable" placeholder and keeps the hash.
- **OSM mapped cameras — viewport-loaded** (2026-08-26): an OPT-IN
  (`CCTV_OSM_CAMERAS_ENABLED=1`, off by default) source of publicly mapped OpenStreetMap
  surveillance-camera POSITIONS (`man_made=surveillance`, `surveillance=public|outdoor|traffic`),
  merged into the live CCTV catalog for the viewport in front of the operator — worldwide, with no
  country list and no bundled snapshot. OSM maps where a camera is, never what it sees, so every
  row is registered with NO upstream URL and resolves through the existing frame chain — Street
  View still (`SRC STREETVIEW`, health `degraded`) or the synthetic `NO UPSTREAM CONFIGURED`
  placeholder. That billable fallback is why it is opt-in rather than a fourth default pack.
  Pose uses mapped values where OSM has them and priors where it does not: bearing from
  `camera:direction` (high confidence; `direction` or a multi-value `camera:direction` → medium,
  otherwise an id-hash fallback at low), tilt from `camera:angle` (the wiki's tilt-from-horizon,
  clamped to the client's pitch range) falling back to a mount-height step, mount height from
  `height`/`camera:mount`, and cone width from `camera:fov` when present — which is almost never
  (~61 uses worldwide), so width normally comes from the `camera:type` prior. Everything unmapped
  stays a modeled prior, so cameras remain RAW PRIOR until calibrated.
  **Server** (`osmCamerasProxy`, `/api/osm-cameras?south&west&north&east`): one allow-listed tag
  query per box, refused above 2° or across the dateline, snapped OUTWARD onto a 0.02° grid
  (~2.2 km) so neighbouring viewports share one cache entry and a cached answer always covers more
  than was asked for, `out body` capped at 400 with an honest `saturated` flag, 5-min memory cache +
  in-flight coalescing + 7-day disk cache (`.gev-cache/osm-cameras/`) with serve-stale at any age,
  rate-limited, and a 20 s budget in which each Overpass mirror gets a fair share of the REMAINING
  time, floored at 8 s (both numbers are field-observed 2026-08-26: a whole-budget timeout let one
  stalled mirror consume the window before the healthy fallback was ever tried, and an even
  four-way split then cut the PRIMARY mirror off mid-answer while the two that were going to fail
  returned 502 in a second). A failed box throws with EVERY mirror's outcome named, so an outage is
  readable in one line instead of reporting only the last error. A disabled install answers 503
  `disabled` so the client stops asking for the session.
  **Client** (`cctv.js`): requests ride the existing camera-settle listener with a 500 ms debounce,
  never per frame; a move that stays inside the same snapped grid cell is not re-asked at all; new
  rows go through the same `prepareCameraForCatalog` → ground-prior batch → `createCameraRecord`
  path as the startup catalog (bounded at 1.5 s instead of init's 8 s, with `applyLateGroundPriors`
  correcting geometry afterwards); the cohort is capped at 120 and evicted through the shared
  `applyEvictionGrace` planner (3 settle passes / 60 s) so panning back a street re-uses records
  instead of rebuilding them. The active camera and any camera the operator has calibrated are
  never evicted. A failed box arms a 60 s cool-off before any new request: without it a down
  upstream turns every camera settle into another four-mirror attempt, which is how a client earns
  a rate ban and cannot help anyway. Viewshed hue identity for these comes from an id hash, not
  catalog position, so a churning cohort never repaints its neighbours. `getStats()` reports `osmMappedCount`,
  `osmMappedStatus`, and `osmMappedSaturated` separately from the feed-bearing catalog count.
  Mapping logic lives in `src/data/osmCameras.js` (pure, unit-tested).
  Scope reality check (Overpass count, 2026-08-26): OSM maps 76,162 `man_made=surveillance` nodes
  in France and 563,156 worldwide — none of which are downloaded up front.
- **Source-aware frame cadence** (2026-08-26): a pack may declare how often its PUBLISHER
  republishes (`upstreamCadenceMs`, measured server-side and served on `/api/cctv/sources`).
  `frameRefreshMsFor` takes the max of that and the product baseline, so a once-a-minute feed
  (Grand Lyon, measured 62 s between distinct frames) is polled at 60 s instead of 10 s while
  packs that declare nothing are untouched. Bounded at 5 min so a bad catalog value cannot
  freeze a feed.
- **Provider placeholder detection** (2026-08-26): the Métropole serves a fixed traffic-cone
  graphic as a valid 200 JPEG when a camera is down, while the row's `last_update` keeps
  advancing — no status field, freshness check, or HTTP code catches it. `isPlaceholderCctvFrame`
  fingerprints it by SHA-256 and the frame route treats it as a failed fetch, so it falls into
  the existing Street View / synthetic chain and the health line names the placeholder instead
  of reporting `SNAPSHOT · OK`. Fails open on any unrecognised body.
- **Incomplete-frame detection** (2026-08-26): `isTruncatedJpegFrame` rejects a JPEG whose
  end-of-image marker is missing from the tail of the body. Grand Lyon's `CWL5801` publishes
  one every cycle (12/12 fetches incomplete, byte count stable within each publication minute,
  so no retry can win it); a browser paints the decoded rows and leaves the rest transparent,
  rendering the camera as a strip of sky. Same fallback chain, reason on the health line. The
  tail window clears trailing metadata without mistaking an EXIF thumbnail's own marker for the
  frame's, and non-JPEG bodies are never judged.
- **CCTV full-resolution viewer** (2026-08-26): the panel preview is a `role="button"` control
  (pointer + Enter/Space); activating it MOVES `#cctv-frame` into `#cctv-lightbox-stage` and
  back on close. A DOM move never re-fetches — a second `<img>` on the same URL would, because
  `/api/cctv/frame` is `Cache-Control: no-store`. The backdrop is fully opaque so no
  unattributed Google Maps content sits beneath it, the dialog swallows the global single-key
  hotkeys while up (Tab excepted), and the bar prints the frame's `naturalWidth`x`naturalHeight`
  so an upscaled 320x240 camera never implies 1080p detail. `#cctv-lightbox` carries
  `data-panel-satellite="cctv-panel"`, which suppresses the panel's pointerleave/focusout
  auto-collapse while the viewer is open. Regression surface:
  `src/cctvLightboxMarkup.test.mjs`.
- **CCTV v3 UX — viewshed + calibration gizmo** (built 2026-07-05 and field
  validated 2026-07-21): the COVERAGE toggle is a
  tri-state cycle `OFF → ON → VIEWSHED`; viewshed mode renders each visible camera's frustum
  as a translucent **color-coded volume** (golden-angle hue per camera, `cctvViewshed.js`)
  welded to the same 5 points as the wireframe — zero new scene queries or update cadences.
  The 7 calibration sliders are **deleted**: ADJUST mode puts a direct-manipulation **gizmo**
  on the active camera (`cctvGizmo.js` — heading/pitch rings, E/N/U arrows, range handle at
  the cap center, FOV handles on the cap edges; all 7 offset DOF), plus a click-to-edit
  **effective-pose readout** (HDG/PITCH/FOV/RANGE/HGT/ΔN/ΔE, absolute values). Persistence is
  now **save-gated**: edits are live but unsaved (`CAL · EDITED` chip) until SAVE CAL writes
  the v2 store. Do not add
  Translation arrows use a depth-test-free pickable tip so E/N/U ownership remains unambiguous even where shafts overlap
  other handles. Avoid hover effects that mutate gizmo polyline geometry (width) — the primitive rebuild blanks the pick buffer and eats the
  following click (root-caused 2026-07-05). Gizmo input checks the topmost, depth-test-free
  handle with `scene.pick` first and uses `drillPick` only as an overlap fallback; this keeps
  hover and press responsive on software GL without changing the real-GPU interaction. Frame serving is bounded independently from the
  10-second active refresh: upstream and Street View attempts abort after 8 seconds, and the
  panel/monitor plane keep at most one same-camera image request in flight. This prevents a
  slow provider from being cancelled and restarted forever while stale `SNAPSHOT · OK` health
  remains beside a pending preview. Grounding is shared with every other height consumer:
  CCTV warms/resolves `groundFloor.js` cells, reads `cachedGroundFloor()`, and delegates optional
  Google 3D refinement to the unchanged `meshFloorSampler.js`. During E/N gizmo movement the
  prior floor is frozen (constant elevation and zero transient samples); release or reset makes
  one resolution request at the committed anchor. U edits remain pure geometry and enforce the
  2 m minimum mount height above whichever shared floor wins, including a rooftop. Public camera
  state exposes `groundPriorM` as the immutable Re:Earth ellipsoidal datum reference; it is kept
  separate from live frustum geometry because Google-3D can refine the rendered ground to the
  photogrammetric mesh.
- **CCTV citywide ambient cards** (built 2026-07-29; shared-host migration
  2026-08-02): the LOD-selected nearby static cameras (20/28/40 by zoom,
  `cctvLod.js`) get **screen-space thumbnail cards** through the shared world-overlay host
  showing paced static frames — reselection on `camera.moveEnd` only, at most one frame fetch
  per second layer-wide, per-source cadences (Austin 5 min, TfL/Caltrans/Lyon 3 min). Zero-flicker:
  a card renders nothing until its first frame, a drawn frame persists through failed fetches,
  and eviction grace (2-pass/5 s) stops budget-edge churn. Camera icons stay visible at every
  zoom. Eligible candidates are filtered to in-view stills with valid IDs,
  finite distances, and one deterministic representative per camera before
  ranking; videos, hidden/malformed rows, and duplicate outliers cannot alter
  the density scale or displace a valid winner. They are ranked with a
  deterministic 50/50 blend of eye distance and normalized screen-center offset
  before the existing 5×4 distribution pass, so the center wins contested
  density without removing peripheral coverage or changing the bounded count.
  The active camera keeps the v3 monitor plane and is excluded from the
  40-card ambient ring with no thumbnail by default. An explicit
  `activeCameraCardEnabled` presentation option can publish the retained
  protected-card path. Disable tears the tier down completely.
  Coverage/viewshed semantics unchanged.
- **Satellites**: orbit rings rotate about Earth's Z by ΔGMST every ~1s (exact inertial→ECEF compensation; no SGP4 re-runs); the tracked satellite propagates per frame with one shared epoch for dot/label/camera. Verified: ISS holds <1km perpendicular to its ring while tracked.
- **Space Missions (30d)**: recent launches render as bounded shared-host, horizon-occluded mission markers using Launch Library 2 v2.3 detailed records. Enabling the layer selects the unified right-side Context panel's Space Missions mode and enables the required satellite layer. Before applying its temporary dense/hidden Satellite mode, Space Missions snapshots the complete standalone Satellite parameter set and exact enabled-layer set. Disabling Space Missions from either Context or the left Data Layers rail restores those parameters and the exact prior enabled state, so a Satellite layer that was already on stays on while a mode-owned dependency returns off; enabling Satellites by itself remains independent. Selecting a mission isolates its launch-to-orbit transfer and dashed satellite orbit, fills that same panel with navigation/details, and animates a small phase-colored marker along the exact displayed Cartesian samples. Marker hit testing drill-picks through photorealistic tiles so the depth-test-free tactical dot remains reliably selectable; its text is non-interactive shared-host presentation. The selected pad is the camera's zoom pivot: the overview remains centered on its launch site, wheel zoom approaches that site instead of drifting elsewhere, and camera pitch progressively changes from global nadir to an oblique close 3D view. Its protected shared-host callout remains visible and expands to include both mission and launch-site names. `FOCUS` flies directly to a 12 km oblique frame around the selected launch site and retains the same anchored zoom/orbit behavior. `REPLAY ASCENT` resets the selected marker at the pad, frames it from an oblique third-person angle, and follows it through the mission-specific compressed ascent directly into one orbital lap at the default `1×` rate. A live `0.25×`–`4×` slider changes ascent and orbit playback speed; adjusting it mid-replay preserves the current path position and historical mission timestamp. Re-entry/recovery cannot be inserted into replay. At orbit insertion the camera smoothly pulls back over the first fifth of the orbital replay and pitches to a globe-scale nadir view while continuing to target the moving replay point. Replay Cancel, mission navigation, deselection, layer disable, and data refresh all release camera ownership. Reconstructed paths are one continuous 128-sample geodetic curve: horizontal departure begins near zero while altitude rises quickly, then the climb progressively bends toward insertion without the former hard 120 km corner. Unmatched orbit fallbacks are smooth planar inclined rings rather than longitude/latitude ground-track curves. The panel lists disclosed payload names, types, operators/manufacturers, mass, multiplicity, and destination when supplied; an empty LL2 payload collection is shown as `CLASSIFIED / MULTI-PAYLOAD`. Launcher, spacecraft, and recoverable payload stages appear in a compact stage table with serial/flight/reuse details, recovery outcome/type, destination, and final coordinates when those records exist; an empty recovery collection omits the section. Stage recoveries with confirmed coordinates use those coordinates; return-to-launch-site records use the pad; downrange-only records receive an explicitly labeled estimated endpoint along the ascent azimuth. Available endpoints render as static 2 px dashed descent/recovery paths with a fixed final-position dot and an estimated atmospheric-interface segment when applicable. The ascent is geodetically densified above the ellipsoid toward the orbit's nearest insertion point, then rendered with `ArcType.NONE`, so it neither cuts through Earth nor separates from the marker. Because LL2 does not normally supply continuous ascent telemetry, pad-to-insertion paths without upstream trajectory samples are labeled `RECONSTRUCTED ESTIMATE` / `ASCENT ESTIMATE`; only supplied trajectory samples receive the replay wording. Selected-orbit framing fits the complete ring, rear-side linework uses normal scene depth occlusion, and current distance, speed, and callout data come only from a launch-year-validated satellite match. Speed is the magnitude of the SGP4 inertial velocity vector at the same propagation epoch as position, displayed in km/s with km/h available as hover detail. Unavailable operator, site, launch-time, orbit, current-altitude, and speed values omit their detail rows instead of reserving panel space with placeholders. Newly launched payloads absent from the core operational groups use CelesTrak's cached active TLE feed as a lookup-only fallback; weak constellation-name matches are rejected. The replay callout maps compressed animation progress onto Launch Library's mission-relative timeline, showing the historical UTC date/time at the marker's current path position; unavailable timelines remain explicit. Matched live satellite positions propagate at one-second cadence and use a distinct green dot/callout with the current UTC date/time.
  When no mission is selected, the Context panel presents a scrollable newest-first roster of every launch in the rolling window, including the smaller 5 px operator-colored marker, provider, and launch date. Hovering or keyboard-focusing a row shows four compact cyan corner brackets on both that roster row and its corresponding globe dot, rotates the globe at the current zoom to center it, and gives its label declutter priority without selecting it; the globe label remains unbracketed. Selecting a roster row invokes the same mission isolation and full-orbit framing as clicking its globe marker. The replay vehicle is one screen-space SVG/CSS HUD overlay rather than separate Cesium billboard, label, and reticle graphics. It is hidden during ordinary Focus and manual close views, where the standard selected launch-site label remains visible, and exists only while ascent replay is active. Its fixed pixel scale is shared by ascent and insertion, so camera range never resizes the rocket on screen before the phase boundary. Generic Launch Library pad names are reduced to their identifying suffix, and replay timestamps use a cyan state title over unprefixed white UTC date/time values. `REPLAY ASCENT` holds the unframed cyan/white rocket at the pad for a real-time `T−10` countdown, transitions through `LIFTOFF`, and attaches six tapered cyan/white ellipse waves directly below it from liftoff through insertion to convey thrust without adding scene geometry. While replay is active, the single start button is replaced by compact Play, Pause, and Cancel icon controls. Pause freezes countdown or mission time, vehicle/stage positions, camera target, labels, and thrust-wave animation; Play resumes from that exact frame, and Cancel releases replay camera ownership. The rocket and thrust group rotates from the path's live screen-space tangent, so its nose follows the visible ascent curve while the adjacent text remains upright. The camera begins as a close oblique launch chase, then smoothly widens between roughly 120 and 420 km vehicle altitude into a higher oblique context view that keeps the moving rocket targeted while exposing the ascent bend and orbit connection. At insertion the rocket/thrust glyph is replaced by the fixed-size cyan orbit dot, which the camera follows through the existing globe-scale orbit pullback. The chase camera limits per-frame yaw changes across heading wraps so it cannot abruptly cross in front of the vehicle and make ascent read in reverse; the replay-speed slider affects mission playback but not countdown duration.
  Mission world text has no native `LabelGraphics`: overview launch markers publish at most 48 ambient candidates for a 24-winner budget, while selecting a mission clears that overview source and publishes its launch-site callout, stage re-entry annotations, live/estimated payload-position readout, and orbit annotation as protected selected-lane entries. The source retains the exact former strings and colors. Static anchors reuse the Cartesian values used to build their mission geometry; the moving payload entry reads the layer's per-frame live-position cache; catalog-backed orbit annotation positions are cached in the same one-second matrix update that realigns the orbit primitive. Keyhole edge fade, horizon culling, final collision placement, and UI exclusion are owned by the shared host. Deselect restores the bounded overview, and refresh, disable, and destroy replace or clear both mission sources.
  A selected mission renders its orbit as four repeating tactical sectors, each containing one prominent cyan dot followed by one hundred thin translucent dashes. The bright dots act as orbit anchors while the subdued dash field remains depth-tested against the globe and is shown only for the selected mission.
  Close selected-pad views add one static 500 m-radius cyan launch-zone ring with a low-opacity translucent fill over the sampled photoreal launch-site surface. The single scene primitive is created only for the visible selected site and is otherwise dormant. It appears during Focus, sufficiently close manual zoom, and the replay countdown, but is suppressed above 120 km camera altitude, beyond 180 km direct camera-to-pad range, for unselected missions, and whenever Space Missions is inactive. Focus establishes a launch-site-centered camera transform once; subsequent manual heading and pitch changes remain centered on that site without an automated per-frame correction. Surface mission markers and labels use an additional conservative globe-limb margin before the exact ellipsoid occluder boundary, preventing near-horizon visibility from alternating between frames.
- **AIS vessels**: chevron symbology (naval cyan base, type tints), world-space headings, MMSI-keyed reconciliation (selection survives refreshes; pinned 3 refreshes with STALE marker when absent), detection-overlay integration (`type: 'SEA'`), contextStore registration for voice Q&A. Empty-space clicks, id-less photorealistic-tile picks, and Escape dismiss the vessel card/HUD/context and clear its trail; picks owned by another layer (including `gev-trail:*`) and raw vessel-record picks without a live MMSI key are no-ops for vessel selection. Click and key handlers detach while the layer is disabled and reinstall on enable. Selecting another vessel replaces the selection and trail, and reconciliation clears a trail if its owning vessel is evicted.
- **Track trails**: server accumulates per-MMSI ring buffers (`/api/ais-live/track?mmsi=`, Float32+Uint32, 64 samples, 30s/25m thinning); aircraft backfill proxies `/api/opensky-track` (OAuth, own credit bucket) and `/api/adsblol/trace` (tar1090 readsb, ~24h history, ODbL — credit adsb.lol).
- Shared `src/data/pickRegistry.js` stops the two flight layers' click handlers from fighting over the camera.

### Share-link v2 layer state (August 2026)

- Generated share links use a deterministic v2 hash. Existing camera, visual,
  HUD, detection, post-processing, celestial, scope, and map-stack fields remain,
  with compact fields for enabled layers, allowlisted layer options, panel state,
  and the active preset's allowlisted shader controls. An absent layer field uses
  deterministic defaults; an explicit empty field means no enabled layers.
- The registry seals only after all 16 production layers register, and every
  layer has an explicit serialization disposition. Unknown enabled-layer tokens
  reject the layer payload; unknown option tokens are ignored. Restoration
  settles independently per layer so one failed or unavailable source cannot
  block its siblings.
- Stable visible options are limited to aircraft 3D mode, selected civilian and
  military flight IDs, Satellite catalog and selection, CCTV coverage/projection/
  auto-hop, and Radio filter/volume. Playback and tuning, live-data health,
  calibration, caches, lifecycle state, temporary Context ownership, and derived
  effects are deliberately excluded. Radio restore never selects or plays a
  station.
- Normal loads restore the last successful explicit UI, voice, or tool choice
  from versioned local storage. Any valid camera share wins for the current load
  without overwriting recipient preferences. Restore ownership is split by
  visibility, option/selection, camera, visual, map, and individual panel lane:
  a newer explicit action supersedes only the field it owns. In particular,
  navigation cannot turn unrelated layers off, and an option change cannot
  cancel the same layer's visibility transition. Every explicit HUD, detection,
  post-processing, scope, or celestial action from the UI, keyboard, voice, or
  public tool facade claims the visual lane before mutation. Invalid requests do
  not claim that lane or partially change controls.
  Direct globe pointer and wheel gestures supersede the delayed shared camera
  and selected-subject Follow without aborting unrelated layer visibility or
  display-option restoration.
- The initial restore has one terminal promise spanning the camera flight,
  visual/map/panel callback work, every production layer result, and the
  destination-scoped selected-subject Follow result. Hash writes remain
  suppressed and the startup screen continues to read `Restoring shared view...`
  until that aggregate settles. Destroy settles it as destroyed rather than
  permitting late mutation. A superseded shared visibility intent follows
  the authoritative successor chain to a terminal lifecycle result, including a
  same-target re-enable or opposite-target disable, before releasing the layer
  barrier. Flights, Military, and Satellite first-update
  fetches consume the manager AbortSignal; disable and destroy also abort their
  module-owned feed or dense-catalog requests.
- Only one Flights, Military, or Satellite tracking ID can be durable at once.
  Explicit selection clears the other families, Stop Tracking clears active and
  pending IDs, and ambiguous incoming multi-family selections fail closed rather
  than letting feed arrival order choose the camera owner.
- An explicit aircraft selection made inside Contacts promotes the owning
  Flights or Military layer from a mode-owned dependency into durable state, so
  leaving Context, reloading, or opening the link can restore it. Passive
  Contacts autofocus does not revoke a pending selected aircraft; the exact
  shared/local target wins when its feed row arrives.
- A shared Flights, Military, or Satellite subject that has not arrived yet
  publishes a persistent top-center `ACQUIRING` progress state while the
  existing deferred-restore latch and source-specific deadline remain active.
  Success, expiry/failure, cancellation, superseding intent, owner-layer
  disable, explicit navigation, and teardown all settle and clear that state;
  caller abort remains authoritative after the pending handoff. A latch that
  rejects its deferred selection emits only the terminal failure and never a
  false acquisition state. An unrelated manager failure preempts `ACQUIRING`
  for its full visible dwell; if acquisition is still owned afterward, the
  progress state resumes. A share-specific terminal failure that arrives while
  another failure is visible is queued, and its own fixed dwell starts only
  when that message reaches the screen. Only terminal failures use the existing
  fixed-dwell error presentation.
- Radio category persistence shares the live directory's bounded normalizer,
  including generated genre identifiers with spaces or `&` such as `Hip Hop`
  and `R&B`.
- Shared panel state starts from deterministic defaults and excludes responsive
  auto-collapse. Partial or malformed panel fields cannot import or overwrite
  recipient-local layout preferences.
- A fresh Cockpit entry temporarily collapses the standard left/right map
  panels and opens Cockpit's own Contact and Live Signals rails. This runs only
  on entry: Previous/Next preserves any panel the operator opens while already
  inside. Exit restores the exact standard-panel open/collapsed snapshot from
  before entry; Cockpit-only disclosure changes do not replace that map layout.
  Opening Data Layers while inside Cockpit temporarily collapses the Contact
  panel to prevent overlap. Closing Data Layers restores Contact only when that
  accordion action collapsed it; an operator's own Contact collapse remains
  authoritative.
  Voice selection of the nearest aircraft near a named place follows
  the requested-layer enable → location arrival → destination refresh → nearest
  airborne lookup → aircraft selection path, excludes on-ground records, and
  never enters Contacts or Cockpit unless either mode is named explicitly. The
  destination refresh also runs when the requested layer was already enabled.
  The lookup inspects the full loaded fleet and tracks by stable ICAO identity.
  That complete route is one atomic voice action, so Realtime sibling calls
  cannot race the nearest-aircraft query ahead of layer enablement. A healthy fallback feed is
  queried normally and its source is returned with the selection; fallback with
  no airborne records remains an honest no-data result, not an enable failure.
- Voice treats the parent Context panel and Contacts as separate intents. An
  explicit request to open Context expands only `global-context-panel`; it does
  not choose a mode. An explicit request to open Contacts expands that parent
  first, activates the Contacts sub-view, and returns the settled 250 km window.
  Its `aircraft` count is the exact civilian-plus-military total when both feeds
  can answer, or `unknown` when either component is unavailable.
- Cockpit's top vision switch cycles five rendered looks: the inherited map
  style, CRT, NVG, FLIR, and Noir. There is no empty `NONE` entry.

### Live AIS Vessels (June 2026)

- Server-side `ws` websocket to `wss://stream.aisstream.io/v0/stream` maintained by Vite middleware; `AISSTREAM_API_KEY` never reaches the browser (AISStream has no browser CORS). The `ws` package is used rather than Node's built-in WebSocket specifically because only it can hard-abort a wedged socket (see the watchdog note in the delta block at the top).
- Browser polls same-origin `/api/ais-live` cache every 60s.
- The subscription defaults to **metropolitan France and its approaches** (`[[[41,-8],[51.6,10]]]`, `src/data/aisSubscription.js`), not the world box it used to open on: ~3 750 contacts instead of ~18 300, so the six-minutely identity messages stop losing the race against the position firehose. `AISSTREAM_BOUNDING_BOXES` overrides it; the silence watchdog self-arms for either measured preset, judged on the RESOLVED subscription rather than on whether the variable is set.
- Learned identities (MMSI → type, name, IMO, hull) persist in `.gev-cache/ais-static/registry.json` for **30 days** — loaded once at start, rewritten atomically at most once a minute and synchronously on shutdown (`src/data/aisStaticRegistry.js`). Before this the map re-learned the whole fleet at every restart, six minutes at a time. `destination` is voyage data and is deliberately never persisted. The registry is swept by the same 30-day TTL and a 50 000-entry cap; `pruneAisStreamCache()` used to leave it untouched, so it also leaked for the life of the process.
- The first enable in a session starts one 30-second client grace timer. Until
  an accepted vessel position arrives, `live`/`open`/`connecting` transport reports
  `LOADING`; the timer is not restarted by the 60-second poll. Expiry or a
  definitive transport/credential failure reports `UNAVAILABLE`. Accepted
  warm vessels survive later zero-position refreshes as stale/degraded data,
  while disable/re-enable owns a new timer and superseded responses remain
  inert.
- Client render cap `VITE_AIS_LIVE_MAX_ROWS` (default 12,000); type-colored ship icons (tanker/cargo/passenger/fishing/tug/pleasure-sailing, plus the off-ramp slate for an undeclared type); screen-space label clustering caps active labels at `VITE_AIS_LIVE_LABEL_MAX_ROWS` (default 900).
- Click-to-inspect wired into the voice context store.
- **The click's camera transfer is a standoff MEASURED from the coast** (`src/data/vesselStandoff.js`, consumed through `WORLD_FOCUS_FRAMING.vessel`): `2.68 × the distance to the nearest land`, floor **12 km**, ceiling **45 km**, pitch −38°, the distance read off the bundled IGN département outlines whose seaward edge IS the coastline inside the AIS box. The factor is the optics, not a taste call — at Cesium's 60° FOV in 16:9 and that pitch a coast at D is inside the frame from EVERY bearing at 2.68·D. The floor rules most French clicks (traffic hugs the coast) and is set where the frame holds a port basin AND the town that names it, while the camera still settles at 7.4 km — under `hullAltitudeM()`, so a vessel in port keeps its true-scale hull. Measured on real positions: Le Havre alongside 12 km, mid-Dover-strait 24 km, off Nice 42.4 km, Ouessant and Gascogne at the 45 km ceiling. Without the outlines loaded (they arrive in `requestIdleCallback` on enable) a click falls back to `defaultRangeM` = 20 km. It is NOT the departure port: AIS gives a position, not a track.

### Voice Control (June 2026)

`GEV MIC` button (bottom UI) starts an OpenAI Realtime session over WebRTC:

- **Token flow**: browser fetches a short-lived client secret from `/api/realtime/token`; the Vite middleware holds `OPENAI_API_KEY` and posts the full session config (instructions, tool schemas, VAD, truncation) to `api.openai.com/v1/realtime/client_secrets`. SDP exchange goes directly to `api.openai.com/v1/realtime/calls` with the ephemeral token.
- **Session defaults** (env-tunable): model `gpt-realtime-2` (or `gpt-realtime-2.1-mini` when the MINI tier is selected — see the model-tier entry below), voice `marin`, reasoning effort `low`, semantic VAD with low eagerness, no response interruption, context window truncated to ~3,000 post-instruction tokens with 0.5 retention ratio — the conversational window stays short because map state is fetched live per turn.
- **Twenty-eight tools** (schemas defined server-side in `vite.config.js`, executed client-side in `src/voice/gevActions.js`): `fly_to_location`, `select_nearest_aircraft`, `adjust_camera_zoom`, `zoom_to_globe`, `set_layer_visibility`, `show_data_layers_menu`, `set_panel_open`, `set_visual_style`, `get_entity_context`, `get_current_view_state`, `set_hud`, `set_detection`, `set_map_stack`, `set_post_processing`, `control_scene`, `control_cctv`, `set_context_mode`, `control_cockpit`, `control_radio`, `track_entity`, `stop_tracking`, `frame_overhead`, `annotate_map`, `clear_annotations`, `move_camera`, `fly_route`, `analyst_query`, and `next_iss_pass`.
> **Reading `npm test` totals:** the count depends on the Node major. The two
> GC-bracketed allocation microbenchmarks (`src/data/focusAllocations.test.mjs`
> = 1 test, `src/overlays/worldOverlayAllocation.test.mjs` = 13) only RUN on the

- **Camera verbs** (`src/cameraVerbs.js`) — one motion slot, driven per clock tick. `move_camera` orbits/pans/tilts/rotates; `fly_route` is a cinematic dolly along an existing route annotation.
  - **The route dolly is shaped, not linear** (2026-08-20). A trapezoid speed profile (smoothstep up, cruise, smoothstep down, distance taken as the closed-form integral) eases both ends without changing the pace — duration is still `totalM / ROUTE_M_S[speed]`, with one exception: a 0.5 s minimum keeps a degenerate route from being an instant teleport, so routes under 10 m (slow) / 20 m (normal) / 45 m (fast) fly SLOWER than the speed word, never faster. Turns bank up to **10°** (a 90° street corner settles near 7.5°), measured as a triangular pulse over a 4 s window centred on the camera so the roll leads in and unwinds after. Altitude breathes ±20 m around the 260 m mean and lifts up to 26 m into turns. Pitch is LOCKED at −32°; heading comes from a gaze that leads the path by 6.5 s of travel. `prefers-reduced-motion` zeroes the roll and the altitude shaping and keeps the easing.
  - **Invariants — do not "fix" these.** (1) **Every** release levels the roll: completion unwinds it through the ease-out envelope, and `interruptCameraMotion` zeroes it synchronously (heading/pitch/position preserved). Cesium keeps the last up vector it was handed, so skipping this leaves the user holding a tilted horizon. (2) Heading is interpolated as an ANGLE about the local up, never as a Cartesian lerp — a lerp cannot cross an antipodal pair, so an out-and-back route looked backwards for the entire return leg; `signedTurnRad` branches the exact-180° case deterministically because the cross product's sign there is a floating-point coin toss. (3) A COLD floor cell is missing data, not flat ground: route vertices carry height 0, so trusting them flew a mountain corridor at 260 m above the ELLIPSOID. The corridor warm is fire-and-forget, so the dolly ARMS — camera untouched, no teleport onto the route — for up to 1.2 s waiting for real floor data, falls back to a rendered-mesh probe (`scene.sampleHeight`) when the DEM stays cold — latched to ONE firing per flight, for exactly the cells the cache could not answer, so a route costs at most 8 `sampleHeight` calls however long it arms — and otherwise holds the launch altitude for the whole route. A corridor is only RESOLVED when every cell is accounted for: one warm cell says nothing about the ground under the other seven, and treating it as an answer let the dolly descend to 460 m over a 1,600 m rendered surface. The probe reads the rendered surface at the current LOD (rooftops and primitives included) — a better estimate than nothing, not a guaranteed upper bound. Never descend blind. The floor is SMOOTHED in both directions for the ride while the hard clearance clamp reads the RAW sample, so a cell boundary cannot pop the eye but a cliff is still cleared on the frame it is seen. A pre-departure floor is adopted whole; one arriving mid-flight is eased onto, and the eye's descent rate is capped.
  - Pins: `src/routeCinematics.test.mjs` (26 tests), with `scripts/qa-flyroute-mutations.mjs` reverting each fix individually to prove they are load-bearing (19 named defects); rendered proof `scripts/qa-flyroute-cinema.mjs` (drives the real voice runner, measures the real Cesium camera every frame, writes a labelled contact sheet).
- **Public control facade** on StyleManager (`setHudVisible/setHudLayout/setDetection/setMapStack/setSharpen/setOrbit/setCleanView/getControlState` plus `runImmediateNavigation`): every setter syncs DOM sliders + share links + scene snapshots and returns `{ok, ...state}` — voice confirms only what actually happened. Validated `move_camera`, `fly_route`, `frame_overhead`, strongest-fire focus, and entity tracking use the shared navigation transaction, which refuses Cockpit before mutation, advances authority, releases follow owners, cancels stale work, and only then starts the requested action. All four entity layers expose `findByQuery/getNearby/getAllPositions/trackById|selectById/stopTracking/getTrackedInfo`.
- **Scene context** (`get_entity_context`): selected entity from the context store, or visible entities ranked by distance to the view target (≤100km altitude); plus basemap context — view-target picking, 7-point viewport sampling, view-scale classification (global/continental/regional/metro/city/local), reverse geocoding (center ≤750km, viewport samples ≤3,000km), Google Places Nearby via `/api/google/nearby-places` (≤25km), known-landmark matching against `CITY_POIS`, coarse country inference fallback. Context assembly is capped at 1.5s with cache fallbacks; caches are deduped in-flight.
  - **Every selectable layer writes that one slot** (2026-08-21). The tracking layers — flights, military, satellites — publish selection on their own awareness lane (`gev:awareness-subject-selected`, consumed by the readout card and the Contacts panel) and for the life of the voice tools never wrote the shared slot, so `scope:'selected'` silently answered `in_view` with a contact plainly selected on screen. They now call `selectTrackedSubjectContext` / `refreshTrackedSubjectContext` / `clearTrackedSubjectContext` (`src/data/contextStore.js`) on select / poll / deselect. **Invariants: (a)** that write path must NOT dispatch `gev:entity-selected` — tracking layers already own an event lane and a second one makes two surfaces fight over one subject; **(b)** exactly one record per tracking layer, because a frozen snapshot of a moved contact must never reach the visible-entity scan; **(c)** precedence is recency, not layer — one slot, last selection wins, so clicking an overlay entity supersedes a tracked plane as the voice subject while the plane stays tracked. Satellites refresh on the 1 s propagation beat, not per frame.
  - **Context-mode vocabulary is symmetric** (2026-08-21). `set_context_mode` accepts `contacts`; the internal id is `flights`. Every model-readable field (`mode`, `entering`, `priorMode`, nested `context`/`contextRollback`, and the transition diagnostic text) is reported in the accepted vocabulary, with the internal id preserved as `<field>Internal`; an absent secondary mode stays `null` rather than claiming to be `off`. Mapping lives in `src/contextModePolicy.js` so UI text and voice payloads cannot drift. Reporting the internal id made the model read `mode:'flights'` as "Contacts is off" and refuse to answer from the `contactsWindow` counts in the same payload.
  - **Analyst → track handoff carries a key, not just a label** (2026-08-21). `analyst_query` items include `icao24`/`mmsi` alongside the display `id`, and contact lookup uses the shared tiered ranking in `src/data/contactMatch.js`: hex exact → callsign exact → registration exact → callsign prefix → registration prefix → callsign substring → registration substring. The tiers keep an exact callsign ahead of a colliding registration regardless of feed order, and registrations compare separator-insensitively (`G-ABCD`/`GABCD`, `05-8152`/`058152`, `N123AB`/`N-123AB`).
  - **A typed command supersedes the turn it interrupts** (2026-08-21). `sendTextCommand` defers its `response.create` behind an active response instead of colliding with it, marks that response superseded so a late function call from it is refused rather than dispatched, and drops the old turn's queued follow-up. A refused call is still ANSWERED — a terminal `{ok:false, superseded:true}` `function_call_output` — because an unanswered `function_call` strands a pending call and deadlocks the model; the refusal creates no response of its own. A burst of typed commands coalesces into one response while keeping both conversation items.
  - **Subject reconciliation across satellite catalog rebuilds** (2026-08-21). A dense↔core toggle or TLE refresh clears and repopulates the catalog, so the published subject is re-resolved against the new satrec; a subject that did NOT survive releases the slot. The per-frame refresh cannot do this itself — `_getTrackedFramePosition` returns early once the satellite has no catalog entry — so the reconcile runs at rebuild completion. An empty catalog is a rebuild in flight, not a disappearance.
  - **One aircraft-proximity engine** (2026-08-22). `collectAircraftProximityWindow` (`src/data/militaryAwareness.js`) is the single computation behind both the Contacts panel window and the voice analyst's entity-centred "how many nearby", so the panel readout and the spoken count for one centre are identical by construction. **Invariant: do not re-derive a proximity count anywhere else.** They diverged before because the panel read live billboard positions (20,000 cap) while the analyst used last-fix coordinates over a 2,000-record slice — 111 on screen, 15 spoken. Explicit regions and arbitrary points deliberately keep the general record engine. Entity-centred results carry `window: {engine:'contacts-window', centeredOn, radiusKm, flights, military, aircraft}`.
  - **Centre precedence for nearby asks**: explicit place in the question > Contacts subject (a selected non-contact entity never silently becomes the centre) > an entity the user names > the current view, said aloud. Contacts active with no subject uses the view rather than reading an empty panel.
  - **Contact-match ties break on hex ascending.** `track_entity` is a mutation fulfilling "follow that one", and the model's observed answer to a non-ok track result is to retry with guesses rather than ask, so the lookup always commits rather than returning an ambiguity. What it owes the caller is stability: hex is unique and always present, so the same query resolves to the same contact for as long as both are loaded.
- **Visual grounding**: at `local` view scale with no structured identity, the client captures the Cesium canvas (≤1200px JPEG, black-frame detection, double-render for freshness) and sends it as `input_image` with a strict "do not invent labels" instruction.
- **Context window**: only the latest viewport screenshot stays in context — the client deletes the prior image item (`conversation.item.delete`) before adding a new one (images are the most expensive item, re-billed every turn). Text history is bounded by the **server-side** `truncation: { type: 'retention_ratio', retention_ratio, token_limits.post_instructions }` set in `/api/realtime/token` (cache-friendly batched truncation). There is intentionally **no** client-side per-turn conversation-item cap — deleting from the front of history each turn busts the Realtime prompt cache. A spatially-aware summarize-and-prune policy is specced for a future iteration.
- **Model tier + spend guard** (`src/voice/voiceCost.js`, August 2026): the voice heading row carries a `STD`/`MINI` toggle and a running session-cost readout (`~$0.42`).
  - **Tier selection.** `standard` = `gpt-realtime-2` (default), `mini` = `gpt-realtime-2.1-mini` (~3× cheaper per audio token). The client sends `?tier=` to `/api/realtime/token`; the endpoint resolves it through the shared registry, so an unknown, empty, or hostile value falls back to `standard` rather than reaching OpenAI as a model id. Responses echo `X-GEV-Voice-Tier` / `X-GEV-Voice-Model` (plus `X-GEV-Voice-Tier-Fallback: 1` when a bogus tier was downgraded). Persisted at `godsEyeView.voiceCost.tier`.
  - **Applies NEXT session.** The model is fixed when the ephemeral token is minted, so a live session always keeps the model it connected with; toggling mid-session only records the preference (the button title says so). The cost tracker's lifetime is the session's lifetime and its model binding is immutable from `start()` to `stop()` — rebuilding it on toggle would erase accrued spend and let repeated toggles bypass the cap. The tracker may only be replaced once the session is FULLY SETTLED (`isVoiceSessionSettled()`: not active **and** no data channel **and** no peer connection) — `!isActive()` alone is not enough, because the `error` status reports inactive while the transport can still deliver a late `response.done`. The toggle itself reads and writes only the persisted preference, never the live tracker.
  - **Env overrides.** `OPENAI_REALTIME_MODEL` / `OPENAI_REALTIME_MODEL_MINI` remain authoritative per tier, so a drifted upstream model id is a `.env` fix rather than a code change. Because an override can point a tier at any model, the client prices against the model id the server actually echoed, **not** the tier it requested. An unrecognised id is billed at the most expensive known rates plus one console warning — under-metering is what lets a cap be overrun.
  - **Metering.** Token usage from each `response.done` is folded into a per-session estimate. Cached tokens are subtracted from their modality totals; any aggregate-minus-details residual (and any payload with no detail at all) is attributed to audio rates, so uncertainty always resolves *upward*.
  - **Thresholds** (one object, persisted at `godsEyeView.voiceCost.limits`): soft warning at **$2** — amber readout plus exactly one console line; hard cap at **$5** — the session ends through the ordinary stop path (data channel and peer connection closed, mic tracks stopped) and the readout reads `Session ended — cost cap`. `0`/negative disables a threshold and round-trips through storage as an `'off'` sentinel (raw `Infinity` would JSON-serialize to `null` and silently restore the default); a corrupt entry falls back to the defaults rather than disarming the cap.
  - **Cap semantics — in-flight tools COMPLETE and are NOT rolled back.** A session-ending latch (`isSessionEnding()`) is checked at the tool-dispatch site, so no *new* tool is dispatched once the cap trips. `extractFunctionCalls` yields at most one call per event, so that single check covers the whole batch. A tool already executing may still finish its map mutation (a camera flight, a layer toggle, an annotation). This is deliberate: unwinding a partially applied map change has no safe general implementation, and a half-reverted camera/layer/annotation state is worse than a completed one.
  - **In-flight response at teardown → the accounting is INCOMPLETE.** Usage only arrives with `response.done`, which never comes for a response cut off by teardown (`stop()` closes the peer connection, and the server cancels rather than completes it). Rather than invent a token count for it, the tracker is marked `incomplete`: the chip shows a trailing `*` (`~$1.00*`) as a see-note mark and the tooltip carries the reason. Deliberately **not** presented as a lower bound — the estimate can also run high (residuals and unrecognised models bill at worst-case rates, and sub-cent totals round up), so it is partial rather than directional. (A bounded teardown drain was tried and removed: `pc.close()` closes the data channels a drain would listen on, so it was structurally dead.)
  - **⚠️ Model ids and rates are external facts** read from OpenAI's model + pricing pages on 2026-08-18 and marked VERIFY-AT-RELEASE in `voiceCost.js`.
- **Reliability**: tool-call dedupe (2.5s window across call/item/args keys); response-create queueing that respects active responses and defers follow-ups when the user starts speaking; per-tool follow-up instructions so the agent confirms only what actually happened (zoom confirms only on `ok=true`).
  - **Barge-in may cancel a SOUND; it may not tear down a DATA LOAD** (2026-09-14). `input_audio_buffer.speech_started` aborts every in-flight tool controller, and `set_layer_visibility` used to hand that signal straight to the data manager — which rechecks it at four lifecycle phases (init/params/enable/update) and answers an abort with `module.disable()`. A cold first enable takes SECONDS (measured over Bordeaux: 5.5 s for `irve-fr` in a live Realtime session, 3.0–4.5 s headless), so any word spoken inside that window killed the load: `irve-fr` and `medecins-fr` came back OFF and empty with `{ok:false, cancelled:true, phase:'init'}` while the model said the source had failed, and `traffic` came back ON and permanently at 0 records while the tool still reported `ok:true`. All three loaded normally by hand a moment later — because the hand toggle passes no signal at all, and because the dead voice attempt had already paid for `init()`. **That asymmetry — "it only works when I do it myself" — was this line, not any data source.** The manager already supersedes a competing request through its own epoch protocol (`activeVisibilityIntent.controller.abort(SUPERSEDED_VISIBILITY_INTENT)`), so the caller's signal never decided which state wins; it only decided whether the losing transaction left a half-built layer behind. `isCurrent` still gates what is SAID, so a superseded turn reports itself as superseded without breaking the map. **Radio keeps the signal** — its enable starts audio, and talking over a station is a request to stop it (`setRadioEnabled` forwards the same signal deliberately). Pinned by `gevActions.test.mjs` (`barge-in never tears down a data layer load, and radio still stops for it`), which asserts both halves.
- **Aircraft identity honesty:** “What is this aircraft?” reads callsign, operator, registration, type, and route only from the selected contact context. Missing operator, route, or type enrichment is named explicitly rather than silently omitted or inferred from the callsign.
- **Diagnostics**: every client/server event is posted to `/api/realtime/debug-log` and appended to `.gev-logs/realtime-conversations.jsonl` (gitignored) with secret/image redaction; last 30 errors persist in `localStorage` (`gev-realtime-errors`); `window.__gevVoiceCommands.getDiagnostics()` in the console.
- **Counting semantics ("near")** — a CONTRACT; new count-bearing tool work inherits it. Three honest numbers exist for one question: the Contacts cohort (250 km around the subject, what the panel shows), `analyst_query`'s count of *currently-loaded* records for the requested scope, and the layer-wide loaded total in `coverage.layersQueried[].records`. They diverge legitimately — the flights layer loads by viewport, so after a camera dive the loaded set can hold a fraction of the cohort (field case: panel 42, analyst 8). The contract:
  1. **Contacts ACTIVE** → "near / nearby / how many aircraft" means the **Contacts window** — the panel's numbers, spoken verbatim. Mechanism: `contactsWindow` (`{centeredOn, radiusKm, flights, military, vessels}`), carried by both `analyst_query` and `get_current_view_state`, derived by `contactsWindowFromSnapshot()` from the same snapshot the panel renders so the two cannot drift. A cohort whose feed cannot answer reports `'unknown'`, never a confident zero.
  2. **Contacts OFF** → "nearby" means **in view**; "near \<place\>" means a radius around that place. A radius query with Contacts active and no explicit centre is centred on the **active contact**, not the camera.
  3. **Every count names its scope in words** — "42 in your window", "8 in view", "about 30 within 250 km of Austin" — never a bare number. `analyst_query` returns `scopeLabel` so this is mechanical. Two different numbers with named scopes are not a contradiction.
  4. **The loaded-data caveat is stated once when relevant**: counts cover loaded data, and the flights layer loads where you look (appended to `coverage.note` for radius/view scopes over viewport-loaded layers).
- **Degradation**: without `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `/api/realtime/token` returns 503 and the mic button surfaces the error; the rest of the app is unaffected.

### AI HUD Summary (June 2026)

- HUD `SUMMARY` readout requests a five-word intelligence-style summary from `/api/openai/hud-summary` (model `OPENAI_HUD_SUMMARY_MODEL`, default `gpt-5-nano`, minimal reasoning).
- Input is the live basemap label context (place/street/nearby-place labels + enabled layers) — the model is instructed not to infer from coordinates.
- Output is sanitized to exactly five words; falls back to the deterministic telemetry summary on error/timeout (5s abort); typewriter animation on update.

### Map Stack Switcher (June 2026)

- `src/mapStackController.js` switches between Google Photorealistic 3D (`photoreal` — through its own Google key, or through Cesium ion when that key is refused or absent; see `src/photorealTileset.js`). **The app no longer OPENS on it.** ion bills that globe per reader, so a public opening on it would cost a root tile per visitor; the app opens on the keyless satellite stack (`ign-ortho`, IGN 20 cm over France and a world satellite base beyond — the same picture from orbit, and free) and `src/photorealAdoption.js` swaps in the real mesh on the reader's first rest under 25 km. The boot flight is excluded by construction: `flyToDefaultCity()` descends to 600 m by itself, so it ARMS the watch, and the arming swallows one rest because Cesium raises `flyTo`'s `complete` before the camera's own `moveEnd`. A deliberate pick from the tray retires the watch for the session. **The tileset is bought on the first activation of that stack, never at boot**: ion meters it by "root tile" and one root tile is one successful request, so loading it eagerly charged a `#map=osm` share link for a globe it then hid, and charged each of the 113 QA harnesses — which is how a 1 000-a-month tier ran out on 2026-09-15. One attempt per session, cached on the controller (`canLoadPhotoreal()` / `getPhotorealTileset()`), and a refusal leaves the reader on the basemap they already had rather than on an empty viewer; only a BOOT refusal walks down the ladder to Google's 2D cartography. `?photoreal=0` — and the window flag `newQaPage()` installs — close the door without spending anything, Bing Aerial / Aerial-with-Labels via Cesium ion world imagery (require `CESIUM_ION_TOKEN`), OSM, and the two keyless IGN France stacks. Bing Road is **retired**: it is gone from `MAP_STACKS`, from the `set_map_stack` enum, and from the voice aliases (road phrasings now resolve to OSM, the one shipped road basemap). An old `map=bing-road` link is simply an unknown id and takes `setStack()`'s `_fallbackStack()` — `photoreal` when it is available, otherwise the first source that is — with that tile lit and **no** `lastError`; pinned live in `scripts/qa-map-source-tray.mjs`. The fallback is deliberately availability-aware: resolving an unknown id to a source this build cannot show would raise a credential error about a stack nobody asked for.
- The bottom Visual Presets tray presents an **eight-tile MAP SOURCE row** (`#map-stack-chips`, `src/mapStackChips.js`): Google 3D, Plan Google, Relief Google, Bing Aerial, Bing Labels, OSM, Satellite, Plan IGN. (`Satellite` keeps the id `ign-ortho` — the label follows what the stack draws, the id is the `?map=` share token and must not move.) The duplicate left `#stack-panel` is retired. The row is a 3-column grid — two rows on desktop, keyed sources on the first and keyless ones on the second — and falls to 2 columns below 620 px. Tiles carry `aria-pressed` on the active source and remain keyboard-reachable with a visible focus outline.
- **IGN Géoplateforme stacks (keyless, France).** `ign-ortho` (`ORTHOIMAGERY.ORTHOPHOTOS`, BD ORTHO® 20 cm, JPEG) and `ign-plan` (`GEOGRAPHICALGRIDSYSTEMS.PLANIGNV2`, PNG), z0-19, via `Cesium.WebMapTileServiceImageryProvider` against `https://data.geopf.fr/wmts`. Four request parameters are load-bearing and each was checked against a live GetCapabilities: `style: 'normal'` (Cesium throws synchronously without it), `tileMatrixSetID: 'PM'` (IGN's Web Mercator set, bit-for-bit Cesium's default `WebMercatorTilingScheme`), string `tileMatrixLabels` `'0'..'19'`, and a `rectangle` clamped to `IGN_FRANCE_RECTANGLE` (lon −5.5..9.8 / lat 41.2..51.2). Without the clamp the provider 404s its way around the planet — the layer's declared bbox is France UNION the DOM and covers most of the globe, so it is useless as a coverage mask.
- **Keyless world satellite under the ortho, and the sleep that keeps it free.** `ign-ortho`'s base layer is Esri World Imagery (`services.arcgisonline.com/.../World_Imagery/MapServer/tile/{z}/{y}/{x}`, `maximumLevel: 19`, CORS `*`, no key), not OSM: a street map under a photograph reads as a rendering fault outside France. Esri caps at the SAME z19 as the IGN layer, so the base continues the sharp layer past its edge and never outruns it (measured over one Paris tile 2026-09-08: IGN 9.8 kB and Esri 12.2 kB at z19; IGN 404s at z20 while Esri answers 200 with a constant 2521-byte "no data" placeholder, hence the explicit cap). `ign-plan` keeps its OSM base — cartography under cartography. On six DISTINCT failed Esri tiles (`watchTileFailures`, counted per tile because Cesium re-raises `errorEvent` on every retry) the base swaps in place to EOX Sentinel-2 cloudless **2017** (10 m, z0-14, CC BY 4.0), leaving the IGN layer and its tile cache untouched; the vintage is load-bearing, as EOX publishes 2018-2025 under CC BY-**NC**-SA and this repo is MIT. **`_syncWorldBaseVisibility()` is the performance contract**: Cesium downloads a lower layer in full even when an opaque layer hides it completely, so over Paris the invisible base cost 46 tiles / 874 kB per view — more than the visible orthophoto. On camera rest (`moveEnd`, never per frame: flipping `show` re-requests tiles), if the UNION of the seventeen `IGN_OPAQUE_BOXES` covers the view rectangle the base goes `show = false` and the cost drops to zero. The union rule replaced a "wholly inside ONE box" rule on 2026-09-09, and the boxes were re-derived at the same time, because between them they were losing the case the cockpit spends most of its life in: at the default -30° tilt (`src/camera.js`, `src/orbit.js`) a view over Paris at 9 382 m spans 1.88-2.70 E / 48.93-49.34 N, crossed the northern edge of one box and the western edge of another, and so belonged to neither — while being 81/81 covered when probed tile by tile. Measured on that exact view: **69 requests / 1 362 kB of Esri fetched under an opaque orthophoto, against the 41 requests / 927 kB of IGN actually on screen — the invisible layer cost 1.5x the visible one.** After the change it fetches 0. Across a sweep of realistic view rectangles over the whole clamp, 30-37% more of them now sleep, and `isRectangleCoveredByBoxes` is exact rather than a heuristic (it cuts the view at every box edge and tests one point per cell), so two adjacent boxes cover a view neither contains while a genuine gap still keeps the base awake. `cutoutRectangle` was measured first and rejected — it reads 37 tiles / 813 kB, byte for byte identical to the plain stack, because it cuts the draw and not the fetch. Both harnesses are shipped: `npm run qa:world-imagery` (composition, credits, and one screenshot per border framing) and `npm run qa:world-imagery-cost` (the per-strategy tile and byte table; it stubs out `_syncWorldBaseVisibility` so the strategies do not race the product's own sleep). The boxes are a probed list rather than `IGN_FRANCE_RECTANGLE` because a layer's rectangle is not its coverage: the clamp contains Brussels, where the Géoplateforme answers `<ExceptionReport>No data found`, so sleeping on the clamp would punch white holes outside France. The boxes are now DERIVED rather than drawn, by `npm run qa:ign-opaque-boxes` (2026-09-09): a 15 554-point sweep on a 0.1° grid over the clamp (42% covered), eroded to points whose eight neighbours are covered too, grown into overlapping maximal rectangles from a lattice of seeds in both axis orders, then re-probed at half the sweep spacing and offset by a quarter step so the check lands on midpoints the sweep never saw. Seven of twenty-four candidates were dropped; the seventeen kept answered real orthophoto at all ~17 100 verification points. The probe reads `content-length` and cancels every body, so a full run costs kilobytes rather than the ~200 MB of imagery it inspects. **Two of the five hand-drawn boxes it replaced were not safe**: `0.5,44 -> 5,49` (the largest, and the only one wide enough to carry a 40 km view) and `4.2,43.7 -> 6,45` each contain a confirmed hole, so the app had been sleeping the base over views where the globe had nothing to draw. They passed their original check only because a 9x9 grid over a 4.5° box samples every 0.56°. Two traps are worth keeping written down, both found by re-running the derivation: thinning an over-large verification grid by halving walks the samples back ONTO the sweep grid, so the biggest boxes end up "verified" against the very data that proposed them; and the Géoplateforme intermittently 404s tiles it does serve, which had one box scoring 1024/1024 and then 1022/1024 on an identical lattice — requiring a refusal to be repeated took the yield from 8 boxes to 17 without relaxing the standard. `npm run qa:ign-opaque-boxes:check` re-verifies the shipped list against live IGN. Both IGN stacks use it, so `ign-plan` also stops fetching the 37 OSM tiles / 268 kB it used to waste per Paris view.
- **An IGN stack is TWO imagery layers, OSM at index 0 and IGN at index 1.** `MapStackController` therefore owns `this._imageryLayers` (an ordered, bottom-first array) rather than a single `_imageryLayer`. The pairing is not cosmetic: Cesium marks the bottom layer as the BASE layer and, in `ImageryLayer._createTileImagerySkeletons`, collapses every tile outside a base layer's bounds onto its edge — France's coastline would paint the Atlantic and then the rest of Earth. DOM-TOM are deliberately out of scope for this pass (three distinct vertical systems).
- Coverage is partial and the tray says so BEFORE the click: an `ign-*` descriptor carries `coverageNote: 'metropolitan France only'`, which `mapStackChipModel()` puts in both the tooltip and the accessible name. It is **not** an unavailable state — the stack really is selectable, it just changes nothing over Texas.
- **`photoreal` unavailability now names its cause.** `MapStackController` takes `googleKeyConfigured`, so a build with NEITHER credential reports "Google Maps API key or Cesium ion token required for Google 3D" — two credentials open this stack, and an ion token alone is enough — while a build that tried and failed reports "Google 3D Tiles failed to load", naming the door (`Google key: … · Cesium ion: …`) when both were tried. Both arrive as `googleTileset: null`; `null` (caller did not say) keeps the old generic wording. `StyleManager.setMapStack()` quotes `unavailableReason` instead of the hard-coded ion string it used for every stack.

### Keyless build (August 2026)

- **`git clone && npm i && npm run dev` boots with no credential of any kind.** `src/main.js` no longer throws on a missing `GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY`; it sets `keylessMode`, skips `createGooglePhotorealistic3DTileset()` entirely (rather than calling it and catching, which spends a doomed round-trip and prints a misleading loader error), and leaves `viewer.scene.globe.show = true` so the first frames are the globe rather than a starfield. `initialStack` is `osm`.
- **The key is never published when absent.** `Cesium.GoogleMaps.defaultApiKey` and `window.__GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY__` are only assigned when a key exists, so every consumer sees a falsy value and takes its own degraded path instead of firing `key=undefined`. `annotationResolver.geocodePlace()` and `gevActions.reverseGeocode()` return null; `gevActions.fetchNearbyPlaces()` skips `/api/google/nearby-places` outright, because the dev server brokers it from the same variable and can only answer 503. `locations.searchAndFlyTo()` is the exception — it takes the keyless geocoder below rather than a degraded path.
- **Place search works with no key at all.** `locations.searchAndFlyTo()` no longer throws when there is no key: it asks `/api/geocode` (`keylessGeocodeProxy()` in `vite.config.js`, client in `src/data/keylessGeocode.js`), which answers the same three things Google Geocoding does — a location, a viewport, and Google-shaped `types` — from OpenStreetMap through Nominatim, with the IGN Géoplateforme (BAN addresses + the IGN POI index) as a France-only backstop for what OSM has not mapped. Everything below the lookup is shared, so a keyless search frames a city, a park, a street and a building exactly the way a keyed one does. `NO_GEOCODER_ERROR_FLAG` and its "Search needs a Google Maps API key" toast are gone with it.
- **`viewbox` alone does not bias Nominatim; `bounded=1` does.** Measured 2026-08-31: "sixth street" with an Austin viewbox still answers a village in Kampala at `limit=10`, while the same box as `bounded=1` answers East 6th Street. A biased search therefore runs the bounded pass FIRST — this path's stand-in for the Google Places near-view recovery a keyed search gets from `placesNearViewRecovery()`. The bias is only paid for when the view rectangle is under 6° per axis; a globe view names no neighbourhood.
- **The view wins, unless the world knows that name better.** The bounded hit is kept unless the worldwide pass returns something with Nominatim `importance ≥ 0.35`: "Toulouse" typed while looking at Austin means the city in France (0.73), not the bistro at The Domain (0.0001, a real bounded hit), while the Kampala "Sixth Street" (0.15) never outranks the street on screen. An in-view hit already above the threshold (Zilker Park, 0.41) short-circuits the second request entirely.
- **Both Nominatim callers share one queue.** The cockpit's reverse geocode and the search box's forward one run through `queueNominatimRequest()` at ≥ 1.1 s apart, carrying the User-Agent and Referer the usage policy asks for and a browser cannot set — the policy counts the application, not the endpoint. Hits are cached 6 h, misses 10 min, identical in-flight queries are coalesced, and a client gets 20 searches a minute.
- **A hairline box is a point, and a low BAN score is a different address.** Nominatim answers "Rocky Mountains" with a 0.0001° box around a single node; framing it would put the camera ~10 km over one arbitrary ridge, so a box under 0.002° on both axes is dropped and the result frames by navigation-mode range instead. BAN, for its part, always answers with its nearest street rather than nothing — an invented "Chemin de Bel Air" comes back as "Chemin de Bellevue" at 0.663, against 0.91-0.97 for exact hits — so the France backstop refuses anything under 0.7 rather than fly you to a street you did not ask for.
- **Still keyed, and still honest about it:** `annotationResolver.geocodePlace()` (annotation anchors), `gevActions.reverseGeocode()` and `fetchNearbyPlaces()` (voice + cockpit place context) remain Google-only and return null without a key. Only the search box is covered.
- Pinned live by `scripts/qa-keyless-boot.mjs` (`npm run qa:keyless-boot`) against a server started with no key: boot, loader clearing, no published key, OSM active, the three keyless sources selectable, an IGN switch that actually returns tiles over Paris, the on-globe IGN credit, a real search that resolves Toulouse and flies there through `/api/geocode`, and zero Google requests.
- `scripts/dev-fresh.sh` warns and continues instead of exiting, and passes the key with `put_env_if_set` so an empty value cannot shadow a configured `.env` entry.

### IGN terrain — DEV-ONLY SPIKE (`?ign_terrain=1`, August 2026)

- `src/data/ignBilTerrain.js` is a `TerrainProvider` over IGN RGE ALTI (`ELEVATION.ELEVATIONGRIDCOVERAGE.HIGHRES`, BIL float32, TileMatrixSet `WGS84G` z6-14). **It is a decision instrument, never a default.** Enabled, it replaces the keyless terrain provider (and overrides Cesium World Terrain when an ion token is present, so the spike is what you actually look at).
- **With the flag on, ground-clamped objects are wrong, and that is expected.** `surfaceRegimeKey()` has two regimes, and `terrain-globe` MEANS "the Re:Earth point-height prior IS the ground". A different provider under a shown globe breaks that identity everywhere heights are cached from it — `groundFloor`, `meshFloorSampler`, `cctv`, `localGeojson.js` (which latches `groundSampled = true` permanently) and `traffic.js` (which precomputes a road network from one sample). The third surface regime is the chantier, not the spike.
- **`getTileDataAvailable` is three-valued and all three values are used**, which cost two silent failures to establish. `true` inside France z6-14 → fetch. `false` above z14 inside France → Cesium upsamples the real z14 parent; serving a flat tile there instead replaced Mont Blanc with a plane the moment the camera came in (`globe.getHeight()` read −0.01 m over the summit). `undefined` outside France and below z6 → the flat `EllipsoidTerrainProvider` fallback; returning `false` there is fatal, because `prepareNewTile` marks the tile FAILED and never requests it, and the two level-0 roots are below z6 by definition — the entire globe rendered nothing, with no error.
- **NoData is a smear, not a sentinel.** A Nice z14 tile holds 4143 samples exactly equal to −99999, ~6500 more within half a metre of it, and a ramp of 505 further values (−1046, −3588, −17466, −50806) produced by lossy resampling blending real heights against the sentinel. `=== -99999` and `Number.isFinite()` both pass those as craters. The rule is a per-sample plausibility floor at −100 m, with the residual stated: 14 samples of 65536 survive in (−100, 0) m on the worst tile found, the lowest at −17.2 m.
- **The BIL grid is cell-centre registered; Cesium's heightmap is edge-inclusive.** `HeightmapTessellator` places sample *i* at `west + i·extent/(width−1)`, so feeding the raw grid straight in leaves a full-cell step at every tile boundary. `resampleToEdgeInclusive()` re-grids and linearly EXTRAPOLATES the half cell past each border (clamping reproduces the step). Measured on an Alpine pair: the seam falls from ~100 % of one sample step to 2.9 % at z14, 7.6 % at z13, 12.1 % at z12.
- Two transport facts the guards depend on: the service replies `content-encoding: deflate`, so `content-length` (200 616 B) is not the decoded size (262 144 B) and a header-based guard would reject every valid tile; and an out-of-coverage reply is a **137-byte** XML body, where `137 % 4 === 1` makes `new Float32Array()` throw. Validation is fail-closed on the decoded `byteLength`.
- `scripts/qa-ign-terrain.mjs` (`npm run qa:ign-terrain`) is the exit-criteria harness. It separates HARD criteria from TARGETS on purpose, so a residual is neither quietly threshold-widened nor allowed to sink the run. Current result: every hard criterion met; one target missed (z12 average seam 12.1 % against a 10 % aim). Measured alongside: decode 0.9 ms/tile main-thread, 16 900 B retained per tile, sea meshing at H = 0.00 m at Nice and Brest, Paris at 27.9 m, and Mont Blanc at 4778.8 m — **26.8 m below IGN's own 4805.6 m ice summit**, a ceiling of the published product (the eight neighbouring z14 tiles are all lower and z10-z13 converge on the same value), not of the sampling.
- The lit tile follows controller state, not the click: a rejected switch (no ion token) or a superseded one (rapid A→B) leaves the genuinely active source lit, and the tray heading keeps its short-label status readout (`...` while switching, amber on `lastError`).
- Ion stacks remain visible and keyboard-focusable when no ion token is configured, but expose `aria-disabled="true"` and do not switch. Their accessible label and tooltip quote `getStacks().unavailableReason` — the same string `setStack()` puts in the toast. OSM works keyless. The `ION` badge is gated on the stack's own `requiresIon`, so a `photoreal` chip unavailable because the Google tileset failed says so instead of falsely demanding an ion token.
- Stack choice participates in share links (`src/sharelink.js`) and falls back to OSM when Google 3D tiles fail to load. Share-link restore, the `set_map_stack` voice tool, and the chip row all land on the same `_setMapStack()` path.

### Voice Map Whiteboard / Annotations (June 2026)

- Runtime entry: `src/voice/lazyVoice.js` calls `initAnnotations({ viewer, tileset })`, exposes `window.__gevAnnotations`, and passes the engine into the voice action runner. **It is no longer part of the boot path** (2026-09-09): the engine, its two renderers and the resolver are 155 kB of the entry bundle and none of them draws the map, so they load with the voice stack — at browser idle, or immediately when somebody reaches for the mic. `window.__godsEyeView.annotations` and `.sceneDirector` are therefore `null` for the first moment of a session and `window.__godsEyeView.voiceReady` is the promise to await instead of polling; `npm run qa:lazy-voice` pins both halves.
- Engine contract: `src/annotations/annotationEngine.js` owns annotation state, TTL/fade lifecycle, concurrent anchor resolution, duplicate detection keyed on geometry, cancellation on clear/newer generations, and a hard cap of 120 live marks. Deferred outline upgrades drain FIFO at concurrency 2; queued work retains the owning abort controller and is discarded on a generation change before it can fetch.
- Resolver contract: `src/annotations/annotationResolver.js` converts names/coords/screen pixels into world anchors and optional geometry. The resolver is type-aware: Google Geocode/Places gives a centroid + scope, OSM/Overpass supplies admin/place/footprint/street/enclosing-area geometry, route requests use `/api/route`, and ambiguous/far results are rejected or recovered near the current view instead of drawing misleading blobs. Only explicitly country/state/county-scoped asks bypass near-view recovery and proximity gating; state scope requires a leading `state of …`/`the state of …` phrase, while bare names, proper names ending in “State,” and administrative geocode result types alone remain guarded. Overpass throttles remain distinct from normal transients: `Retry-After` is honored for one retry, and a repeated throttle ends only that mark's outline upgrade.
- Renderer contract: `src/annotations/hybridAnnotationRenderer.js` routes draped `area`/`route` geometry to world-space Cesium rendering and reticles/pins/arrows/callouts to the screen-space SVG renderer. Area labels are screen-space callouts so all captions share one visual language; progressive outline upgrades convert the existing screen group in place when the anchor snaps to the resolved centroid.
- Tooling: voice has `annotate_map` and `clear_annotations` tools. Annotations accumulate and persist by default; clearing is explicit only. Partial failures, approximate synthesized zones, and route fallbacks are returned as structured tool results so the voice layer can be honest.
- Console/dev API: `window.__gevAnnotations.tour()`, `.demo()`, `.annotate()`, `.clear()`, `.count()`, and `.list()` are the deterministic no-mic test surface.
- Current known resolver gap: mall/lifestyle districts such as "The Domain, Austin" can prefer a named building over the broader retail envelope. Product decision is that districts should become envelope + key buildings, but the scoring change still needs a careful multi-case validation pass.

### 3D Aircraft + Tracking (June 2026)

- **The TRACKED contact's 2D↔3D handoff is DEFAULT behaviour (2026-08-19), driven by camera distance alone.** It does NOT consult the DISPLAY-rail `3D` toggle, which continues to own the FLEET (the un-instanced draw-call budget stays the operator's decision). Policy lives in `src/data/trackedModelRegime.js` and is shared by both layers: enter below `TRACKED_MODEL_ENTER_ALT_M` = 150,000 m and hand back to the billboard only above `TRACKED_MODEL_EXIT_ALT_M` = 172,500 m. **The swap distance was set by playtesting on 2026-08-20:** a first pass at 1,000,000 m switched too early; 2D reads correctly at ~600 km and the handoff belongs at ~150 km. **Consequence, recorded on purpose:** the tracked contact now enters 3D NEARER than the FLEET does (`MODEL_ALT_CEIL_M` = 800,000 m, unchanged), so with the DISPLAY-rail `3D` toggle on, 150–800 km draws surrounding contacts as models while the selected one is still a glyph. Nothing double-draws (the fleet pass skips the tracked icao) and aligning the two is a fleet-side decision, deliberately out of scope. **The two thresholds are asymmetric on purpose:** a single threshold makes a tracked orbit sitting ON the boundary strobe billboard↔model as the camera's altitude wobbles across it. Do not collapse them. The latch is scoped per selection, so a new target re-evaluates against the ENTER ceiling rather than inheriting the previous target's exit band. Exactly ONE model is involved; it loads on demand when the regime opens, is HIDDEN (not released) on regime exit so re-entry has no load gap, and is released by the existing teardown on deselect/re-track/destroy. Cockpit and TR-3B suppression are unchanged. **Two invariants around it:** (a) the hysteresis latch AND the load-failure latch are per-selection state cleared by `_resetTrackedSelectionState()` in the tracking lifecycle (deselect / re-track / cross-layer / init / destroy) — the predicate's icao-change guard is defence only, since it needs a drawn frame while nothing is selected and the render governor's idle mode does not promise one; (b) on-demand loading is bounded at 3 attempts per selection with a 1.5 s backoff and one console warning naming the asset — the driver runs every `scene.preUpdate`, so an unbounded catch means a missing GLB spins load→reject at frame rate. The billboard stays the visual throughout a failed load.
- **Grounded 3D handoff is terrain-validity gated (2026-08-23).** A ready civilian or military glTF does not own the visual until `groundSnap` (`src/data/groundSnap.js`) can answer with a MEASURED photoreal-surface height. On success the layer writes `height + the model's measured belly offset` before revealing the model. Cache movement is measured on the WGS84 surface, not across altitude, so a stationary contact keeps its snap through poll-time vertical-datum changes. Model existence or GPU readiness alone never suppresses the billboard floor, and ordinary zoom/style/deselect transitions preserve a valid snap cache. **Two states, and the difference is the whole design.** COLD — nothing has ever resolved for this icao (tiles still streaming on first sight, sample failure, backoff after a first miss): there is no evidence of where the ground is, `heightFor` returns null, the model stays hidden and the depth-test-free 2D billboard remains opaque and floored. WARM — a snap resolved and then a >`MOVE_INVALIDATE_M` (50 m) taxi move stopped it answering directly: the measurement is DEMOTED to a bounded last-known rather than deleted, and it keeps answering while the resample is outstanding, so a taxiing aircraft does not pop 3D→2D→3D across a 2–30 s retry backoff. The bound is `HELD_SNAP_MAX_DRIFT_M` = 250 m from the spot the value was measured at, past which the hold is dropped rather than stretched and the contact is COLD again. It is spatial with no timer beside it (ground under a contact that has not moved does not change; what invalidates the value is the contact MOVING) and deliberately a quarter of the billboard chain's `HELD_FLOOR_MAX_DRIFT_KM` — that hold only ever RAISES a sprite, while a held snap IS the model's placement, so its error shows in both directions. A fresh sample releases the hold, and so does a ground flip (which already calls `forget`). **A loading model is HIDDEN, never zero-scaled:** admission sets `show = false` (Cesium's default is `true`, and an unplaced primitive would claim the visual at the identity matrix), and ownership is `ready && show` — Cesium 1.138's `Model.update` has no `show` guard, so hiding a primitive costs its load nothing.
- Commercial and military aircraft use the same high-level FLEET model regime: 2D billboards when zoomed out, optional glTF models when closer, controlled by the DISPLAY rail `3D` toggle and `Proximity` / `All` modes. Since 2026-08-16 (Hangar fleet) models are PER-CLASS: real CC-BY GLBs for light/bizjet/turboprop/widebody/helicopter/uav (`CLASS_MODEL_REAL` in `src/data/aircraftClass.js` — meters-baked, scale 1, per-model belly/radius; provenance in `public/models/README.md`), the shared `airplane.glb` for the remaining civilian classes, and the military layer maps weight classes (real GLBs / 747 heavies / `jet.glb` fastjets, per-model heading offsets, always flat amber). Textured civilians carry a HEAVY tint, not a light one: `MODEL_COLOR_BLEND_AMOUNT` is `0.94` in BOTH layers under Cesium's `ColorBlendMode.MIX`, so the class colour supplies 94% of the surface and the asset's own texture ~6%. The visual direction is clean light silhouettes with only a weak diffuse contribution from the approved textures, so liveries deliberately do NOT read. IR boost raises the blend to a full `1.0`. Under NVG/FLIR (map preset or Cockpit vision) models render unlit flat-white at full alpha and scene fog is disabled (fog otherwise blacks out distant models with the globe hidden); state restores on exit.
- The DISPLAY-rail `3D` toggle is the user-facing activation path for both aircraft layers. Their small approved GLBs build their render resources without Cesium's frame-spread job queue, preventing continuous Photorealistic 3D Tiles streaming from starving model readiness; model caps, tracking, camera, and fallback billboards are unchanged.
- **The `3D` toggle DEFAULTS ON in `proximity` on a first run.** Proximity is itself the budget — models appear only below `MODEL_ALT_CEIL_M` and only for the nearest `MODEL_MAX` in view — so the default costs nothing at globe scale, and `all` remains a deliberate opt-in. A fresh boot runs NO layer-state restoration (`LayerStateCoordinator.start()` returns early with neither a share payload nor stored state), so four independent initializers decide what a first-run operator sees and must agree: `booleanOption('models3d', 'e', true)` in `src/data/layerState.js`, `_models3dEnabled = true` in BOTH flight layers, `this._models3dEnabled = true` in `src/ui.js`, and the `active` / `visible` classes on `#models3d-toggle` / `#models3d-mode-row` in `index.html`. All four are pinned together in `src/data/layerState.test.mjs`. Explicit state still wins: because the codec omits default-valued options, `models3d: false` is now what travels in a link (`lo=…f.e.0`) and restores OFF at both aircraft layers. **Consequence for returning users:** a stored `gev:layer-state:v2` blob is a FULL options snapshot, so a session that wrote one before this change carries `models3d:false` and keeps 3D off until the operator flips it (or clears the key) — the durable snapshot is treated as the recipient's own state, by design.
- **Consequence of the flip on the recorded tracked/fleet inversion:** the 150–800 km band where surrounding contacts draw as models while the SELECTED one is still a glyph is now what an operator sees WITHOUT arming anything. The inversion itself is unchanged and still deliberate (see `src/data/trackedModelRegime.js`); only its reachability changed.
- Civilian and military 2D aircraft use the established distance scale: `3×` near
  the camera and a `0.5×` floor from 8,000 km outward. A standard 20 px ambient
  icon therefore remains about 10 px at globe altitude while retaining the
  established close-range silhouette. Any compact alternative requires
  before/after visual evidence.
- Fleet model eligibility is distance-based with on-screen priority and hard caps (`MODEL_MAX`, `MODEL_MAX_ALL`) to avoid draw-call explosions. Each model owns its own `modelMatrix`; shared scratch matrices are forbidden because they caused stacking/flicker.
- Tracked aircraft use standalone model primitives driven from the already-settled dead-reckoned display position, while the tracked Cesium entity remains billboard-backed so `viewer.trackedEntity` always has a ready bounding sphere.
- Flights and military layers mirror the same tracking invariants: no warm-up freeze/jump, altitude-scaled framing, trail head glued to the displayed plane, no pull-out when switching targets, and no cross-layer orphan when switching between commercial and military tracks.
- Regression surface: `npm run test:track` drives the real app headless with synthetic aircraft feeds and asserts the tracking invariants without depending on live OpenSky/adsb data. `src/data/trackedModelRegime.test.mjs` pins the tracked contact's threshold math, the enter/exit asymmetry, and the default-on / cockpit / TR-3B / deselect wiring in both layers.

### TR-3B conversion Easter egg (August 2026)

- With a contact tracked, CONTEXT ▸ CONTACTS shows a small 🛸 chip beside COCKPIT (`#tr3b-toggle`, gated by `CockpitView.syncTr3bToggle()` on a tracked contact — not on the cockpit entry policy). Pressing it converts that contact into a TR-3B and pressing it again restores the real aircraft. State lives in `src/data/tr3bRegistry.js`: a session-scoped module-level `Set` keyed by ICAO 24-bit address, shared across both flight layers the same way `militaryRegistry.js` is, so a conversion holds through a civil↔military handoff. It is deliberately NOT persisted (no localStorage, no share-link param, no schema change) and layer teardown deliberately leaves it intact — only a page reload clears conversions.
- The sprite is two hidden kinds (`tr3b`, `tr3bHot`) in `src/data/aircraftIcons.js`, authored in the same 96×96 nose-up pipeline as the eight class silhouettes, so the triangle points along the display course through the existing screen-projected rotation path with `alignedAxis` still `ZERO`. They are unreachable from `classifyAircraft()`. Variant selection rides the existing `irBoost` layer param, so under NVG/FLIR/surveillance the hull stays cold and the four emitters render hot; a style switch re-images only converted contacts, never the rest of the fleet.
- Both layers resolve every `aircraftIcon()` call through a local `_iconKind()` shim (identity for unconverted contacts), so no refresh path — poll reconciler, two-tier raster swap, presentation pass, tracked entity — can revert a conversion.
- The class label follows the conversion across every surface that reports one: tracked card, cockpit/`getTrackedInfo`, Contacts, and the analyst record's `aircraftClass` (`tr3b`, the style-independent id, so a query answers the same in FLIR as in Normal). Callsign, flight level, speed, and route stay live-feed truth.
- A converted contact is billboard-only. It is excluded from model eligibility at SELECTION time, so it never consumes a `MODEL_MAX` cap slot, with the handoff guard and the tracked-model regime guard kept as defence. The billboard stays shown, so the contact keeps satisfying the `getNearby` / `getDetectableObjects` visibility guards and still works in Contacts and Cockpit.
- Regression surface: `src/data/tr3bRegistry.test.mjs`.

### Split-flap status chips (August 2026)

- The three status chips flip their LABELS over character by character when the text changes, like a departure board: `#global-loading-label` ("LOADING LIVE DATA" → "LOAD COMPLETE"), `#traffic-sync-label`, and `#cctv-sync-label` ("loading frames" → "camera grid ready"). All three route through `setSplitFlapText()` in `src/splitFlap.js`; there is no other writer of those three elements. The progress counters (`#*-sync-progress`, `#global-loading-detail`) are deliberately left as plain `textContent` — they tick several times a second, and flapping them reads as a slot machine.
- `#global-loading-label` doubles as the universal top-center status banner, so anything routed through `_showGlobalStatusNotice()` flaps as well — in particular the share-link restore notices, of which "Shared military flight could not be restored — feed unavailable" is the longest at 63 characters. That needs no special case: `planSplitFlap()` compresses the stagger to hold the 620 ms budget (26 ms → 6.9 ms per column at that length), every column is reserved for the whole cascade, and `element.textContent` is the complete notice at every instant, so the `aria-live` region announces the whole sentence rather than a fragment. A notice deferred minutes past boot is equally safe: `ensureHost()` re-validates the shell on every call, and the long-lived `Text` node is never replaced.
- **DOM text is the truth, and its node NEVER moves — do not "fix" this.** The first call upgrades a chip label into a permanent shell (`ensureHost`): a `.gev-flap-text` span holding one long-lived `Text` node, plus an `aria-hidden` `.gev-flap-cells` sibling. After that the ONLY text operation for the life of the chip is `node.data = next`. Nothing is reparented, so the label is never transiently empty and the `aria-live` region never sees a removal/reinsertion pair it could announce twice. `element.textContent` is the settled string at every instant, because the cells carry no text at all: both glyphs are CSS generated content (`::before` from `data-flap-prev` = outgoing, `::after` from `data-flap-next` = incoming), which never reaches `textContent`. This keeps QA pins honest and lets `_updateTrafficSyncChip`'s own `textContent !==` guard keep working. The shell is built on a tick where the text is NOT changing, so no real label change ever carries a structural mutation.
- **No animation loop, and exactly ONE `setTimeout` per change.** CSS `animation`/`transition` only, triggered once per text change and staggered through a per-cell `--gev-flap-delay`. The single timer is the settle that strips the cells; the width ease ends on a `transitionend`/`transitioncancel` listener, never a second timer. Idle cost is zero, there is no periodic work, and nothing requests a Cesium render or takes a render-governor hold. `setSplitFlapText` is a no-op on unchanged text, which is required — the chips are repainted by a 60 ms and a 500 ms ticker.
- **Only what was visible flaps away.** An interrupted cascade (A→B cut short by C) derives each column's outgoing glyph from `visibleGlyphs()` — what that column is actually SHOWING at that instant, which for a column whose stagger has not elapsed is still A, not the pending B. `FLAP_TURN_RATIO` must track the `gev-flap-out`/`gev-flap-in` keyframe crossover in style.css.
- **Columns never renumber mid-cascade — do not "optimise" this away.** For the whole cascade the board keeps one column per index of the LONGER string, each holding its own width; a column the new string does not reach flaps to a BLANK in place (`data-flap-next=" "`) rather than collapsing. Collapsing stacks the absolutely-positioned outgoing glyphs on one x AND lets a later glyph slide into an earlier column, which makes `visibleGlyphs()` lie and the interrupt rule flap the wrong glyph away. Pinned by "a cleared column holds its place instead of letting later glyphs slide left".
- Length changes are eased, never snapped, and the ease is placed so it never fights the flaps (`.gev-flap-sizing`): a GROWING label reserves its columns as the cells go in and eases at the START; a SHRINKING one holds full width for the whole cascade and eases at SETTLEMENT.
- Accessibility: the cells sit in an `aria-hidden` wrapper and the settled string is real text in the a11y tree, so the `aria-live` chips announce the label once per change rather than character fragments. No `aria-label` is used — ARIA prohibits naming a generic `<span>`. Because the text node is permanent and only its data changes, a label update is a single `characterData` mutation and settlement is none — node churn in a live region can double-announce.
- A chip hidden by clean-UI, recording mode, or an un-`.visible` (`opacity: 0`) traffic/CCTV chip swaps instantly instead of animating where nobody can see it; `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` does the same.
- Kill switch: `SPLIT_FLAP_ENABLED` in `src/splitFlap.js`. Set it `false` and every chip returns to a plain instant swap with no other change.
- Regression surface: `src/splitFlap.test.mjs`.

### Panoptic Detection + Tracked Readout (June 2026)

- `src/data/detection.js` samples enabled layers through each layer's `getDetectableObjects()` contract and renders bounding boxes/labels from the shared host's sole Cesium post-render callback so boxes align with the final camera frame.
- Detection diagnostics count fading labels from the arbiter rows that are
  actually rendered. The label QA harness uses time-weighted label exposure for
  churn and requires conclusive solve/frame samples at both its 12,000-object
  pathological field and 5,200-object normal field without relaxing budgets.
- `src/data/detectionDraw.js` performs the batched, DPI-crisp canvas drawing for tier-colored labels, corner brackets, callouts, and distance-scaled tracked boxes. Unit tests cover label measurement and draw geometry.
- `src/data/trackedReadout.js` publishes a protected shared-host callout above tracked aircraft and satellites or selected mapped installations. It reads only each layer's cached display position—never a fresh entity position evaluation—preventing readout jitter against the rendered target. AIS selection remains in the vessel source's protected card path.

### Not Currently in Runtime

- Weather radar (removed before OSS v1 after QA; no reliable visible payoff)
- General replay/timeline systems outside the Space Missions experience
- LiDAR explorer and paired-point CCTV calibration experiments

## Auth + Launch

- Recommended launcher: `./scripts/dev-fresh.sh` (also: `dev-secure.sh` for stricter bindings, `dev-cctv.sh` for CCTV source-pack tuning)
- Build gate: `npm run build`
- Network access: local-only by default (`HOST=localhost` in dev-fresh.sh); LAN is an explicit opt-in via `HOST=0.0.0.0` (launcher prints a key-exposure warning + LAN URL; see SECURITY.md)
- OpenSky default mode: OAuth (`OPENSKY_AUTH_MODE=oauth`; `anon` works without credentials)
- Google key expected in Keychain service `google-maps-api` (or `GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY`, or `.env`)
- OpenSky credentials expected in Keychain service `opensky-network` (or env, or `.env`); `OPENSKY_AUTH_MODE` and `OPENSKY_CREDENTIALS_FILE` read from `.env` too
- Optional-key precedence in `dev-fresh.sh` is uniform — explicit shell env, then `.env`, then Keychain: `OPENAI_API_KEY` (Keychain `openai-api`/`api-key` — voice + HUD summary), `AISSTREAM_API_KEY` (`aisstream-api`/`api-key` — live vessels), `CESIUM_ION_TOKEN` (`cesium-ion`/`token` — Bing stacks), `TOMTOM_API_KEY` (`tomtom-api`/`api-key` — live traffic flow), `FIRMS_MAP_KEY` (`firms-map`/`map-key` — live fires), `LL2_API_TOKEN` (`.env` only)
- An empty string is not "unset" on either side of the launcher, and both sides are handled. `scripts/read-dotenv-value.mjs` hides the requested key from `process.env` for the duration of the read (Vite's `loadEnv` otherwise lets an inherited empty export win over the parsed files) and restores it after. A key the launcher resolves to nothing is then removed from the dev server's environment outright (`env -u`), not merely omitted — the child inherits this shell's environment, and Vite backfills `.env` only over undefined variables, so an empty export in either place would shadow a configured key. `CCTV_CALTRANS_DISTRICTS` is the deliberate exception: empty is its documented Caltrans kill switch and is passed through as-is
- `.env` supported via `.env.example` template

### Proxy/Security Baseline

- CCTV proxy rejects client-specified upstream URLs (server-side source allowlist only).
- CCTV upstream still-image fetches use an explicit abort controller with an
  eight-second timeout; the timer is cleared on every success or failure path.
- OpenSky response cache stores successful upstream responses only; OAuth token refresh calls are coalesced.
- A cold OpenSky failure uses the current camera subpoint only to request a cached adsb.lol point fallback capped at 250 nm. A fresh OpenSky response or last-good cache wins; a nominally successful worldwide snapshot more than two minutes old prefers viewport-scoped adsb.lol when available, otherwise the stale source is reported honestly. The fallback is visibly source-labeled and is never presented as a worldwide snapshot.
- GBFS response size is capped; CCTV health map is bounded.
- Proxy error payloads are sanitized (no internal error details returned to clients).
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` is server-side only; the browser receives ephemeral Realtime client secrets from `/api/realtime/token`.
- `AISSTREAM_API_KEY` is server-side only; the browser reads the same-origin `/api/ais-live` cache.
- `/api/google/nearby-places` keeps the Google key out of Places requests issued for voice scene context.
- `/api/google/text-search` keeps the Google key server-side for view-biased Places recovery used by annotation resolution.
- `/api/overpass` is bounded by body/response caps, per-client/global rate limits, concurrency limits, mirror fallback, in-flight dedupe, cache bounds, and static validation that every selector is spatially bounded.
- `/api/military-installations` uses an independent limiter with the same 90-per-client/300-global one-minute bounds, so viewport installation refreshes never consume `/api/overpass` annotation/traffic capacity.
- `/api/route` proxies bounded OSRM route requests for annotation routes, with profile allowlisting, distance caps, response caps, caching, and sanitized "no route found" errors.
- Track endpoints: `/api/ais-live/track?mmsi=` (server-accumulated ring buffers; sub-route handled before the rows snapshot), `/api/opensky-track?icao24=` (OAuth, 60s cache, sanitized errors, independent OpenSky credit bucket), `/api/adsblol/trace?hex=` (60s cache, 5MB cap, ODbL attribution required in UI).
- Realtime debug logs redact API keys, bearer tokens, client secrets, and image data URLs before writing to disk; request bodies are size-capped.

## UI/UX Runtime Defaults

- Z ladder: panels promote within 100–139 (renormalized on wrap), voice pill 150, toast 200, clean-view exit 300.
- Panel POSITION keys are versioned `v8` (`godsEyeView.v8.panelPos.<id>`); collapsed-state keys remain `v6`. The one-time position reset clears stale DISPLAY placements that could overlap the Context rail.
- Map Source lives in the bottom Visual Presets tray. The left accordion contains no MAP STACK panel, and the `k` panel token that addressed it is gone from the share registry, so legacy `ui=k...` state takes the ordinary unknown-token skip.
- A dock popover (Visual Presets, Location) auto-dismisses on mouse-away unless pinned. Focus inside the tray defers that dismissal only when the browser reports `:focus-visible` — keyboard focus and typed-into fields hold the tray open; a mouse-clicked tile does not, because Chromium focuses a `<button>` on press.
- GEV MIC control is a glass capsule (var(--glass-bg), blur(24px) saturate(1.4), 999px radius; panel radius in error state).
- The desktop right rail (`#right-context-rail`) owns `LEGEND`, `DISPLAY`, `CCTV`, its active parameter controls, and `GLOBAL CONTEXT` as one fixed responsive stack in that order. Its compact buttons use the same 176 px width as the left accordion and one consistent 50 px height, share the left stack's 52 px edge inset and measured top baseline across HUD variants, then constrain themselves against visible HUD/chrome rectangles and the remaining vertical corridor. `DISPLAY` is no longer draggable and legacy saved coordinates are ignored.
- The right rail is labeled **DISPLAY** (formerly "MOVE") and groups, in order, HUD, DETECT, Sharpen, 3D, Clean-UI (HUD + DETECT promoted to the top). Its expanded controls retain the same compact 176 px width as the right-side tabs instead of growing to the wider Context detail-card width. It starts COLLAPSED on first run and respects the user's later `v6` collapse choice. Collapses/expands with directional chevrons (`◀` collapsed, `▶` expanded).
- **The map key (`LEGEND`) leads the rail** since 2026-09-03. It used to be a fixed card in the bottom-left corner, and `body:has(#data-panel:not(.collapsed)) .map-legend { display: none }` switched it OFF whenever DATA LAYERS opened, because that panel (z 100) would have covered it (z 92) anyway. With dozens of layers in DATA LAYERS the reader lost the key at the moment they needed it, so the key moved to the one column DATA LAYERS never reaches and the rule went with the conflict that justified it. It is a full rail member — `data-panel-id="map-legend"`, share token `e`, its own collapse chevron, `v6`-persisted, open by default — and FIRST in the allocation order, which is the one slot `panelStackAutoCollapseIndices` never auto-collapses. `#map-legend-items` is the scrolling surface under the allocated height, and `.map-legend` carries `max-height: var(--right-stack-max-height, 70vh)` as a FLOOR — the allocation is written by an rAF-scheduled pass, and a `requestRenderMode` scene that has gone idle can leave that frame pending (measured: a three-layer key 1 400 px tall in a 900 px viewport with the pass unfired). A legend with nothing to key sets `hidden` and is filtered out of the rail pass entirely, so it cannot hold the leading slot while measuring zero. An open key does NOT count toward `hasExpandedPanel`: it ships open and opens because a layer is on, so counting it would let Tactical exclusivity take the DISPLAY, CCTV and CONTEXT launchers off screen for anyone who merely enabled a layer. Cockpit hides the rail by `visibility` rather than `display` for one reason: the key opts back out from under it and returns to the bottom-left corner, because the rail's own column is where Cockpit puts its DISPLAY and RADIO launchers. Since 2026-09-09 it is the ONLY mount point: the same entries also printed inline under each layer row in `#data-panel`, so every enabled layer published its swatches twice and the left copy pushed the next layer's row down the panel (the seven live-vessel families cost seven lines above `Bouées marines`). `manager.js _syncRowControls()` now renders CHIPS only — they are controls — and one `_refreshTogglePanel()` pass feeds this mount alone.
- **Since 2026-09-10 a legend block states its own EXTENT, and the block with something on screen leads its row.** Over Biarritz the key measured 434 px of content in a 308 px window — `velo-pulse-fr` opened it with six classes over 561 sites, all of them in Paris or Lyon, and pushed the 84 objects actually in view below the fold. A layer may publish `legendScope: {inView, where}` from `getRowControls()`; `_legendRows()` sinks a member declaring `inView: 0` below one that does not, stably, and silence is never a demotion. Two further optional keys share the same hook: `legendBar: true` folds ORDERED classes into one segmented track (`legendBarWidths()`, strictly proportional except for a 3.5 % floor on a non-empty class — the darkest pulse step measures 1.83:1 against the cockpit glass, and two neighbouring steps only ΔE 14.6 in normal vision, which is also why segments carry a 2 px surface gap and a hairline); and `entries[].channel` names the channel an entry answers and lays that channel's entries side by side, so a layer painting SHAPE and COLOUR over one population cannot be read as two populations. A blurb on a side-by-side entry moves to its tooltip — there is no column to hang a sentence under. Measured after: Biarritz 233 px, Paris (six operators, three shapes, six bands) 292 px, neither clipped.
- **Bloom is gone** (2026-09-03, owner decision D1). The global `scene.postProcessStages.bloom` pass, its DISPLAY button and slider, `src/bloom.js`, the `setBloom` facade, the `bloom` half of the `set_post_processing` voice tool and the `bloom`/`bi`/`bv` share tokens are all removed. It shipped `enabled: false, intensity: 0`, so NO rendering changed. The `bloom` uniforms of the NVG and FLIR shaders are a different thing — preset parameters, not the pass — and stay, share token `b` included. Links written before the removal still open: an unknown hash token is simply never read.
- Display and Context use matching 330 px expanded widths and matching compact tab dimensions. The parameter panel is part of Display's expanded content. DISPLAY may remain open beside one contextual panel; CCTV and Context are mutually exclusive. In Tactical HUD, expanding CCTV or Context hides the other contextual launcher while DISPLAY remains independently available. The most recently opened right-rail panel owns the constrained lane even when it appears later in DOM order; passive restoration and automatic disclosure do not replace that explicit owner. Minimal and other HUD layouts retain the collapsed launchers; when their active panel exceeds the measured corridor, the rail reserves sibling heights and gaps and scrolls the active panel internally.
- `STYLE PRESETS` and `LOCATIONS` start collapsed, expand on intentional hover/click, and auto-collapse after hover leave delay.
- Collapsed mini-status indicators show active style and active location/landmark.
- Detection mode is user-controlled and should persist when switching styles. Since 2026-08-22 it also STARTS on for every style on a first run, Normal included — as a `GLOBAL_POST_DEFAULTS` baseline that does NOT set `_detectionUserOverridden`. Since 2026-09-10 it starts at Balanced @ 50% (`FIRST_RUN_DETECTION_PRESET`), not at the tactical Dense @ 75%. Exception (unchanged): selecting a military style (CRT/NVG/FLIR) auto-enables the Dense preset, but only until the user manually changes detection this session (`_detectionUserOverridden` gate), after which style switches never touch it.
- Detection runs in the bottom lane of the shared host's single world-overlay `postRender`
  listener (not `preRender`) to eliminate bounding-box drift at close zoom.
- **Detection takes NO continuous-render hold (2026-08-22, `src/data/detectionRenderDemand.js`).**
  It repaints on CHANGE and asks the governor for exactly one more frame while work that spans
  frames is still outstanding. This is load-bearing for the detection-on-by-default flip: the old
  unconditional `holdContinuousRender('detection')` would have pinned every idle first-run tab at
  60 fps, defeating the render governor. Measured on a parked scene with zero layers: **0 renders
  per 5 s with detection ON, identical to OFF**; reinstating the hold gives 301. Gated by
  `scripts/qa-perf.mjs` §1b, which also counts the PAINTER's own frames so a painter that had been
  disabled outright could not score a perfect idle. The invariants — each of which a live
  adversarial review found broken in the first cut:
  - **Every kind of outstanding work must terminate.** A predicate that can stay true forever is
    the hold under another name. Three qualify: the enable fade-in, label fades, and a solve the
    frame could not run.
  - **Label fades count in BOTH directions.** A newly selected label is `selected`; counting only
    the fade-out tail left it invisible on a parked scene until an unrelated frame arrived.
  - **Paint and demand share ONE monotonic timestamp** — the host frame's `frame.timestamp`
    (`performance.now()`, sampled once per frame). Re-sampling dropped the terminal frame of a fade
    (paint at 219 ms drew alpha 0.99545; a policy re-reading at 220 ms said "done"), and a wall
    clock that jumps backwards keeps demand alive until it catches up. Nothing in the draw pass may
    use `Date.now()`.
  - **A skipped paint DEFERS, never cancels.** The relief valve's skip and its follow-up request
    come from one decision (`detectionPaintSkipDecision`), so it cannot drop the only frame that
    was requested.
  - **A changed detectable set dirties the solve.** Detection PULLS candidates per paint but
    re-solves on a private 125 ms throttle, so a layer tick that swapped contact A for B could be
    spent on a paint that declined to re-solve. `markDetectionSourcesChanged()` is called from the
    manager's layer tick and visibility change, next to the render request each already makes —
    discrete events seconds apart, never per frame — and it deliberately does not request a frame
    itself, because the caller already did.
  - **AIR brackets stay prompt because the AIRCRAFT LAYERS hold the loop, not detection**
    (verified live 2026-08-23). Brackets — including the alpha-floored ones — are painted inside
    `_drawOverlay` from live positions and take no part in the sources-changed notification, so the
    obvious worry is a floored bracket sitting stale on a parked scene. It cannot: an AIR bracket
    exists only while an aircraft layer is enabled, and `flights.enable()` /
    `militaryFlights.enable()` each take a continuous-render hold for their own per-frame fleet
    animation. For exactly as long as there is anything to bracket, the scene renders every frame.
    Measured on a parked camera: `holds: ["flights"]`, `requestRenderMode: false`, and an
    outside-aircraft population change moved the painted bracket count with no camera input. This
    is a COUPLING, so `detectionRenderDemand.test.mjs` pins it — a later perf pass that strips those
    holds the way it stripped detection's would take bracket promptness with it, silently.
  - Known, pre-existing, and deliberately out of scope here: the overlay's backing store does not
    re-derive on a DPR change mid-session (`worldOverlay` sizing — untouched by this work).
- The detection MODE BANNER (`DENSE VIS:… SRC:… DENS:…% ELASTIC …ms`) is
  developer telemetry and is HIDDEN by default. It paints only under
  `?detectDebug=1` (the `trafficDebug` convention), resolved once per
  `initDetection`. The same numbers are always available from
  `getDetectionDiagnostics()`. On a zero-object frame the "armed, nothing in
  view" signal is carried by the scanlines and sparse focus ring, not the banner.
- The HUD summary's `NEAR <landmark>` callout is capped at 150 km (metro scale).
  Beyond that it falls through to the `SECTOR <lat> <lon>` readout. The POI
  catalogue covers eight cities, so a looser bound made the HUD announce
  landmarks on other continents.
- Panoptic mode shows labels on ALL items (no stride skipping). Tracked/selected items keep bounding box but suppress label (skipLabel flag). Tracked items get enlarged bounding boxes (56×44 vs default 22×14).
- The 3D aircraft toggle reveals `Proximity` and `All` modes and drives both commercial and military aircraft layers. It ships ON in `Proximity`, so the button paints lit and the mode row paints open from markup; the panel is therefore ~36 px taller than before, which Cockpit's Display/Radio strip absorbs through its existing primary-only corridor solver.
- The host-painted tracked-target readout sits above the post-FX layer and follows tracked aircraft/satellites or selected mapped installations using each layer's display-position contract.
- Cockpit entry is gated to the operational Contacts context bundle. The
  Context chooser must be in Contacts mode, Live Flights and Military Flights must both
  be enabled, and a civilian or military aircraft must be tracked. The visible
  Cockpit actions and the `C` shortcut use the same gate, so ordinary standalone
  flight-layer selection cannot enter a context-dependent cockpit.
- **Aircraft cockpit view:** selecting a commercial or military aircraft reveals a `COCKPIT` action (`C`). Cockpit mode temporarily releases Cesium's orbit-follow transform and drives a first-person camera from the tracked aircraft's existing smoothed display position and course. Its concave helmet-visor HUD shows callsign, UTC time, coordinates, curved roll/pitch guides, and a seven-division heading tape. Ambient commercial and military AIR contacts use a Cockpit near/far band selected by the shared Display 3D mode: Proximity admits at 150 km and retains to 185 km; All admits at 400 km and retains to 450 km. The shared 3D toggle now applies in Cockpit: Off keeps in-range contacts as rotating 2D aircraft silhouettes, while On lets a ready admitted glTF take over without a drawing gap. The Cockpit model cap remains 60 and can only lower the map budget; in-range contacts that are capped or still loading remain 2D silhouettes instead of degrading to out-of-range dots. Contacts outside the selected band use small rotation-free cyan-white pips for civilian aircraft and amber pips for military. The pilot's own airframe is not drawn in first person, and exiting clears the Cockpit band and restores normal map silhouettes/models. The normal left accordion remains available for Layers and Scenes and keeps the same 26vh HUD-aligned anchor used in map mode, independent of whether the bottom-left Contact card is expanded or collapsed; the right-rail CCTV and Context chooser are hidden to avoid duplicating or overlapping the cockpit presentation. When the intelligence HUD is enabled, its classification, scene summary, collection/orbit metadata, coordinates, and imaging-status text remain visible as reduced peripheral cockpit telemetry; the optical center and flight instruments stay clear, and turning the HUD off still hides it. Ground speed, exact heading, and rendered altitude form one compact lower-center instrument cluster, keeping the horizon and peripheral view open. A second live altitude tape hugs the inside-right visor rim: its rail and nine moving ticks are derived from the same responsive keyhole radius, remain 20 px inside the circular edge even on wide displays, fade deeply at both vertical ends, and move continuously behind a fixed current-altitude pointer; its interval tightens automatically near the surface and it is suppressed on narrow screens. Cockpit mode also has a weather-backed transparent volumetric-cloud pass derived from the supplied FBM/domain-warped R&D shader. It renders at no more than 520×320, uses 24 ray steps/three FBM octaves at 12 FPS, is clipped to the visor, fails clear when Open-Meteo is unavailable, and stops its animation completely on cockpit exit. It does not restore the prior CPU weather canvases, precipitation, scene fog, or any map-mode effect. When Contacts is active for the tracked aircraft, the compact `CONTACT` rail adds the 250 km subject window, four cohort counts, nearest observed/mapped example with relative bearing and distance, freshness, explicit uncertainty, and Previous and Next controls plus its own collapse control. The mirrored right rail is a three-page **cockpit briefing carousel**: source-backed live signals, location-matched regional headlines, and local place/current-weather context from OpenStreetMap Nominatim and Open-Meteo. It is manual-first: Previous, Next, and direct page controls are always available, and the visible `CYCLE OFF` / `CYCLE ON` control starts or stops the nine-second page cycle. The cycle pauses on hover or keyboard focus and stops while collapsed, hidden, or outside cockpit mode; live signal data continues refreshing either way. Empty news matches and unavailable news use compact text states rather than reserving an empty media frame; partial local data remains explicit. Article links open their original publisher, and no headline is treated as verified risk intelligence. On desktop both cockpit rails use the same width and share a bottom-aligned safe baseline in opposite corners above the peripheral MGRS/GSD/time telemetry, leaving both that text and the lower-center instrument cluster readable. They collapse independently to slim tabs without stopping live data updates. Narrow screens use separated top/bottom fallbacks. Empty-space globe clicks are inert while cockpit owns the camera; `C`, `Escape`, or `EXIT COCKPIT` explicitly exits and restores the same tracked entity and standard follow camera. Unknown feeds remain unknown, selection loss still exits safely without inventing a replacement track, and the cockpit never presents the summary as threat scoring or an all-clear. This is a desktop first-person presentation, not a WebXR session.
- **Cockpit left-panel clearance:** the Cockpit Contact card and peripheral HUD participate in the adaptive left accordion's live obstacle measurements, including live viewport-height changes. Expanding Layers or Scenes keeps the active panel in the available upper-left corridor with internal scrolling; it does not cover the Contact card, lower Cockpit controls, or Cesium credit line. Outside Cockpit the hidden card does not alter the normal corridor.
- **Cockpit Context scope:** the 250 km radius applies to the air/sea proximity cohorts. Installation counts come only from the currently loaded viewport and are labeled `CURRENT VIEWPORT ONLY` in the cockpit as well as the normal Context panel; neither surface presents them as a complete 250 km installation survey.
- **Cockpit camera anchor:** first-person mode does not write feed-boundary corrections directly into the camera. A cockpit-only inertial anchor advances from the selected aircraft's displayed course and speed, then converges toward the authoritative delayed track with correction capped below forward motion. The displayed kinematics are derived from the same consecutive fix segment as the rendered position, with raw feed speed/course used only as fallback; a transient zero/missing feed speed therefore cannot freeze a visibly moving aircraft after layer enable or a map/cockpit handoff. Rendered altitude continues to come from that interpolated track position. Late ADS-B fixes and short render stalls can remove drift without accelerating or reversing the view. Camera placement runs before scene update/culling at a bounded 20 Hz so a moving cockpit does not force Photoreal 3D Tiles to retraverse on every display frame; textual instruments update at 10 Hz and context/layout work at 4 Hz. Every far Cockpit contact pip shares one stable Cesium texture-atlas entry and skips unused screen-projected course calculations, while only in-range 2D aircraft silhouettes pay the screen-projected rotation cost; ambient glTF collections are hidden/retained rather than synchronously destroyed at cockpit entry, and context rails lay out only on explicit content/state changes and viewport resize. The deliberate 15/30-second layer interpolation delays and per-Cesium-frame position caches remain unchanged.
- **Cockpit route, vision, and view controls:** visible on-screen `COCKPIT`, `RESET`, and `EXIT COCKPIT` controls replace reliance on the `C` shortcut. RESET uses the same canonical globe route as the map and voice actions, exits Cockpit, and releases its camera ownership rather than exposing the hidden map-style top action. When the tracked commercial flight has a plausible ADSBDB route, the top of the right briefing rail shows a compact `FROM → TO` airport strip and the visor shows a centered estimated-destination chevron with its relative bearing; absent or implausible route data hides the strip and cue rather than guessing. The cockpit-local vision control is an interactive `PREV / CURRENT / NEXT` carousel over the inherited map preset, `CRT`, `NVG`, `FLIR`, and `NOIR`; its previous/next actions wrap, and activating the current value advances to the next style. The inherited entry is named directly, such as `NOIR`, and retains that map shader. There is no empty `NONE` entry. CRT, NVG, FLIR, and NOIR temporarily activate the existing Cesium post-process stages, while returning to the inherited entry or exiting Cockpit restores the pre-entry visual style. The regional-news page uses a free Google News RSS locality query first, with the existing GDELT query retained only as a fail-soft fallback; linked headlines remain reporting, not verified incidents or risk intelligence.
- **Cockpit weather status:** the earlier multi-canvas atmospheric compositor remains fail-closed and is not attached to the live viewer. Cockpit clouds are a separate transparent WebGL pass with a capped 520×320 framebuffer, 24 ray steps, three FBM octaves, and a 12 FPS ceiling. It defaults off and starts only when local storage explicitly contains the persisted `WX ON` opt-in (`'1'`). When opted in, observations refresh after five minutes or 25 km of aircraft movement, fail transparent when unavailable or clear, and stop on exit or disable. `WX OFF` governs atmospheric rendering only: the briefing still fetches source-backed Nominatim, headline, and Open-Meteo local-information data, aborting and replacing any in-flight request when the selected aircraft changes. No weather effect runs in map mode and no synthetic fallback is shown.
- **Cockpit trail visibility:** entering cockpit hides the selected aircraft's trail body and head so they cannot cross the first-person view; exit restores them. This cockpit-only presentation change does not alter the normal map-mode invariant that aircraft trails render through terrain using their depth-fail material.
- **Aircraft course slew:** civilian and military 3D models retain the 60°/s course limiter, but each rendered frame can consume at most 250 ms of accumulated slew time. A long tile/render stall therefore catches up over multiple visible frames instead of turning one delayed frame into a heading snap.
- **Manual-first cockpit briefing:** the right-side Live Signals / Regional News / Local Info carousel does not advance automatically on page load. Previous, Next, and direct page controls remain available; the visible `CYCLE OFF` / `CYCLE ON` toggle explicitly starts or stops the nine-second page cycle, which still pauses on hover/focus and while collapsed, hidden, or outside cockpit mode. Live signal data continues refreshing in either state.
- **Photoreal horizon blend:** Cesium's sky atmosphere remains enabled behind the hidden base globe, but its light intensity, saturation, and brightness are reduced from the library defaults so the distant Google Photorealistic 3D Tiles boundary blends into the sky instead of producing a bright cyan horizon seam.
   - **Cockpit direction and speed tapes:** plausible destination metadata now drives one translucent, isometric visor chevron labeled directly below with the estimated geographic bearing; the prior full geodesic dashed path is not rendered. A mirrored live ground-speed tape follows the inside-left keyhole rim using the same responsive curve, end fades, fixed pointer, and fractional tick motion as the altitude tape on the right. Speed values scroll upward as they increase while altitude values scroll downward. Its tick endpoints and current-speed pointer share the rail's inset-circle origin, so the markings stay attached to the visible curve rather than drifting inward with the text-label gutter.
- Voice control UI (`#gev-voice-control`) shows status states OFF / CONNECTING / LISTENING / EXECUTING / ERROR.

### Current Global Post Defaults

**Reasonable-defaults batch (2026-08-22), extended and partly revised
2026-08-23 and 2026-08-24, and re-read off the owner's own console
2026-09-10.** First-run defaults move together as one coherent console
presentation. Every one is a FIRST-RUN baseline only: a
share link or the operator's own hand still wins over it, and none of them sets
the `_detectionUserOverridden` / explicit-intent flags that would suppress a
separate landed behaviour. Pinned in `src/reasonableDefaults.test.mjs` (feather,
detection, OUTSIDE opacity) and `src/data/layerState.test.mjs` (3D).

**The 2026-09-10 defaults** (superseding the 08-24 values of `DENSE 75%`/`7%`/
`1%`/`11%`): the first-run look is Detection **BALANCED `50%`**, ELASTIC
allocation, Fade **`24%`**, OUTSIDE opacity **`37%`**, scope feather **`49%`**,
and 3D fleet mode PROXIMITY (unchanged), with `AIRCRAFT_BRACKET_FLOOR_ANCHOR`
moved to `0.37` to stay pinned to the OUTSIDE default it calibrates against.
The instruction was a screenshot of the owner's own DISPLAY panel, with the ask
that the settings on it become the shipped defaults — so these four values are
one reading, not four rulings. Two terms that must never be conflated:
scope FEATHER softens the black scope-mask edge; detection FADE is the
label/card fading band around the keyhole. The OUTSIDE slider's `step` stays
`1` so every low stop is reachable.

**What moving OUTSIDE up costs the AIR bracket floor.** The floor lifts side
aircraft brackets so they survive a faint surround, and it is anchored so
`AIRCRAFT_BRACKET_ALPHA_FLOOR` (`0.35`) lands exactly at the default. With the
anchor at `0.37` the whole ramp sits at or below the identity line, so the
rescue is INERT at every setting — including a hand-dialled `1%`, where
brackets now fade with their own labels instead of being held up. That is the
consequence of the anchor tracking the default rather than the slider position,
it is recorded in `detectionPolicy.test.mjs` rather than hidden, and moving the
default back down re-arms the mechanism unchanged.

**Allocation, defined precisely** (matches
`src/data/labelArbiter.js` `allocateLayerQuotas`): **ELASTIC** begins with
roughly equal capacity across active layers and redistributes unused
entitlement (`labelArbiter.js:170`); **WEIGHTED** allocates using visible
demand with square-root demand scaling and semantic layer weights
(`labelArbiter.js:181`). First-run default: ELASTIC.

**A default has THREE surfaces, and a PARSE fallback that is not one of them.**
The value literals (engine constant, markup value, markup readout, `ui.js`
`GLOBAL_POST_DEFAULTS`, the share generator's starting state) must all move
together, because a fresh boot runs no restore and those literals ARE the startup
state. The `scf` / `ko` PARSE fallbacks deliberately do NOT move: they answer
what an OLD LINK that omits the field meant, and such a link was authored under
that era's default (`scf` → 35, `ko` → 5). Every link since carries both fields
explicitly, because the generator always writes them, so no era whose default
later changed depends on a fallback either way.

**They do NOT all persist the same way, and only one of them persists at all.**
Worth stating plainly, because "a default you can override" and "a default that
remembers" are different promises:

- **3D models** have durable storage — `gev:layer-state:v2` in local storage,
  written by `LayerStateCoordinator` on explicit intent. A session that stored a
  snapshot keeps whatever it stored, across tabs and restarts.
- **Detection mode/density and scope feather have NO storage key at all.** Their
  only durable carrier is the URL hash (`dm`/`dd`, `scf`), written on a 500 ms
  debounce. A same-URL reload therefore keeps them only if that debounce already
  fired; a bare URL or a new tab returns to these defaults. That is unchanged by
  this batch — it is simply what these controls have always done — but it is the
  reason "stored state wins" is true of the 3D toggle and not of the other two.

**Known edge (detection, pre-existing, deliberately not redesigned here):** a
hash-restored `dm=OFF` restores the MODE but not `_detectionUserOverridden`,
which is session-scoped. A recipient of an OFF link who then selects a military
style therefore gets the style's auto-enable, where the original author — who had
turned detection off by hand — would not have. The default flip makes this edge
easier to meet (detection is now on more often), but does not create it.

- Sharpen: `ON`, intensity slider at `49%`
- HUD: `ON`, layout `tactical`
- **Detection: `BALANCED` @ `50%`** — ON for EVERY style on a first run, Normal
  included (was `OFF` @ `50%` before 08-22, then `DENSE` @ `75%` until
  2026-09-10). It reads its own frozen
  `FIRST_RUN_DETECTION_PRESET { mode:'balanced', densityPct:50 }`, declared
  beside — and no longer the same object as —
  `MILITARY_DETECTION_PRESET { mode:'dense', densityPct:75 }`, which remains the
  TACTICAL look the military styles and the Contacts context mode apply
  (Contacts OWNS detection while active and restores the prior state on exit —
  `contactsDetectionPolicy.js`; Cockpit deliberately does not touch detection at
  all). Splitting them is the point: a first run is now quieter than
  CRT/NVG/FLIR instead of sharing one number by coincidence. `50` was already
  the density slider's markup value, its readout and the detection engine's own
  `_densityPct`, so the baseline and the DOM finally describe the same console.
  Fade opens at `24%` since 2026-09-10 (`7%` on 08-24, `16%` before). Style-switch semantics are
  unchanged: CRT/NVG/FLIR still carry `detection: MILITARY_DETECTION_PRESET` and
  still yield to `_detectionUserOverridden`; Normal still has no
  `STYLE_PRESET_DEFAULTS` entry, so switching TO Normal touches nothing. A share
  link carrying `dm=OFF` still restores OFF.
- **Detection OUTSIDE opacity: `37%`** (moved `5% → 3% → 1% → 37%`; the world
  beyond the keyhole is readable rather than erased).
  `KEYHOLE_OUTSIDE_OPACITY_DEFAULT` in `src/celestialRing.js`, mirrored by
  `#detection-opacity-slider`'s markup value AND readout,
  `GLOBAL_POST_DEFAULTS.detectionOutsideOpacityPct` in `ui.js`, and
  `_detectionOutsideOpacityPct` in `sharelink.js`. The slider's `step` is now
  `1`, so 1–4 % are reachable at all (at the step of 5 they were not).
  `AIRCRAFT_BRACKET_FLOOR_ANCHOR` in `src/data/detectionPolicy.js` MOVES WITH IT
  — now `0.37` — because the mapping follows bracket brightness rather than
  slider position; see the inert-floor note above for what that costs. The `ko`
  PARSE fallback stays at `5`.
- **Scope feather: `49%`** — a wide, atmospheric falloff (moved
  `35% → 0% → 8% → 11% → 49%`; the `0%` hard crop lasted one day). `SCOPE_FEATHER_RATIO_DEFAULT` in `src/scopeMask.js`,
  mirrored by `#scope-feather-slider`'s markup value AND readout and
  `_scopeFeatherPct` in `sharelink.js`. The slider is untouched and still spans
  0–100, and an explicit `0` is still the hard-crop path — pinned, so moving the
  default cannot quietly delete it. The `scf` PARSE fallback deliberately stays
  at `35`: a link predating `scf` was authored when 35 was what its author saw,
  and restoring the author's view is what a share link is for.
- **3D aircraft models: `ON`, mode `proximity`** — see the 3D Aircraft section
  above and the DISPLAY-rail entry below (was `OFF`).
- Style shader starting params: CRT/NVG/FLIR pixelation `1.2` (just above the native `1.0` floor); thermal/FLIR ships an optional Ironbow "Predator" palette (`palette` uniform, default `0` = accurate grayscale).

## Operational Notes

- **The chronicle is the one middleware that is not a cache.** Five French
  feeds publish only the present and keep no history — GTFS-RT (151 PAN feeds),
  the QualiCharge dynamic charge-point file, Bison Futé DATEX II, AISStream over
  the France box, and Vigicrues. `recordChronicle` (in `vite.config.js`, policy
  in `src/data/chronicle.js`) folds each into a **168-slot typical week in
  Europe/Paris**, kept indefinitely, and appends thirty days of raw ticks under
  `.gev-cache/chronicle/<source>/YYYY-MM-DD.ndjson` — a finished day is gzipped
  in place (measured ratio 7.3). Read back at `/api/chronicle-fr/{status,series,
  profile,anomalies}`; nothing there writes.
  Four of the five ride on fetches the proxies already make and are ON by
  default (`CHRONICLE_DISABLED=1` stops everything). The fifth polls for itself
  — 1.17 MB gzipped every 15 min — and is OPT-IN via `CHRONICLE_IRVE_DYNAMIC=1`,
  armed in `deploy/vps/docker-compose.yml`.
  Three invariants, each pinned in `src/data/chronicle.test.mjs`: a slot counts
  DISTINCT WEEKS and refuses to score anything under three; a non-finite value
  is refused rather than folded as a zero ("the feed said nothing" is not "the
  feed said zero"); and a value is scored BEFORE it is folded, so an
  expectation never contains the value it is judging. Vigicrues declares
  `profile: false` — a flood answers to rainfall, not to Tuesday — and
  `/anomalies` refuses it with the reason rather than returning an empty list.
  The transit fleet series is `feed.reported`, never `feed.inView`: the proxy
  answers per viewport, and folding the in-box count would make one series mean
  two different quantities. Full reasoning in `docs/CHRONICLE.md`; QA harness is
  `npm run qa:chronicle -- --url http://localhost:5173`.
- **Earthquake discs are STATIC geometry.** Every quake is a `CLAMP_TO_GROUND`
  ellipse; a `CallbackProperty` axis re-tessellates its ground primitive every
  frame, which cost 32.4 ms/frame and 30 fps on the shipped 58-event feed. The
  axes are plain numbers, redefined only when a poll brings new data, and the
  former ±15% radius pulse is gone. Because nothing in the layer animates
  per frame, it holds NO continuous-render hold — the governor stays idle with
  earthquakes on, and the manager's `layer-tick` / `layer-visibility` requests
  carry new data to the screen. Pinned in `src/data/earthquakes.test.mjs`.
- **Geocode framing has an off-centre sanity gate.** A viewport that is both
  bigger than any city (>300 km diagonal) and not centred on its own geocoded
  location (anchor >15% of the diagonal from the centroid) is replaced by a
  40 km metro box on that location. This is what stops "Tokyo" — which geocodes
  as the PREFECTURE, islands and all — from framing open Pacific. `country`
  results are EXEMPT by decision (several have the same pathology from overseas
  territories; reframing a country is a product decision, not a bug fix), and an
  explicit `viewMode: 'overview'` ask bypasses the gate entirely so "show me an
  overview of Hawaii" still frames the whole administrative area.
- **Viewport framing is antimeridian-safe.** `flyToViewportBounds` pads from the
  short-way-round longitude span and wraps the padded edges, so a dateline-
  crossing box stays its true width. Raw subtraction inflated a 0.41° metro box
  to 86.7° and a 60° territory to 132°.
- CCTV calibration persists at `godsEyeView.cctv.calibration.v2` (v2 rebuild;
  the store was wiped clean, no import from the old `v1` key).
- CCTV v3 floor QA pins are: zero samples for heading-only edits; zero transient
  samples and constant elevation during E/N drag; one shared-floor resolution on
  release; late one-shot shared-cell work is permitted during viewshed idle. The
  A+B harness intentionally excludes citywide LOD assertions.
- Draggable panel positions persist at `godsEyeView.v7.panelPos.<panel-id>` (collapsed states at `godsEyeView.v6.panelCollapsed.<panel-id>`).
- Legacy draggable-panel position keys may remain in local storage for backward compatibility, but the map-mode right rail ignores them; collapsed states still persist at `godsEyeView.v6.panelCollapsed.<panel-id>`.
- Flight/military tracked entities cache dead-reckoned positions per frame to avoid callback desync flicker.
- Aircraft 3D-model and tracking invariants are covered by `npm run test:track`; run this before touching `flights.js`, `militaryFlights.js`, `detection.js`, or `trackedReadout.js`.
- Annotation resolver behavior is pinned by `src/annotations/annotationResolver.test.mjs`; re-run that suite before changing place-resolution scoring.
- Layer input handlers (click + keydown) are detached on disable for flights/military/satellites/AIS vessels.
- Traffic tile cache is capped and traffic layer supports explicit destroy cleanup.
- Traffic feed state is honest about simulation. `getStats().mode` is the
  CONFIGURED source ('live' = a TomTom key is present, 'sim' = keyless), NOT
  this instant's health — health rides on `error`. Keyless reads FALLBACK with
  `SIMULATED — add TomTom key for live` in both the sync chip and the panel
  meta line; an unreachable `/api/tomtom/status` reads
  `SIMULATED — traffic service unreachable`; a total flow-fetch failure in live
  mode sets `error` (DEGRADED · `SIMULATED — <reason>`) and zeroes the stale
  coverage number. `stats.loading` covers outstanding flow work as well as the
  road fetch, so a failure landing after the 250 ms paint race still ends the
  shared loading batch as LOAD FAILED. Harnesses must gate on `!stats.error`,
  never on `mode === 'live'` alone.
- **The dots obey two things TomTom cannot tell them: signals and speed limits.**
  A dot's cruising speed is `min(highway-class table, OSM maxspeed)` —
  `roadSpeed.js`, a ceiling and never a substitution, so a Paris `primary`
  renders at its posted 30 km/h while a motorway keeps the table's 90 rather
  than jumping to the legal 130. Junctions come from a single global two-phase
  clock (`trafficSignals.js`, `SIGNAL_CYCLE_MS` 70 s): a street's bearing
  folded to 0–180° buckets it into phase 0 (0–90°) or phase 1 (90–180°), and
  one phase holds the green at a time, so perpendicular streets alternate by
  construction with no per-junction data. The junction itself is a vertex two
  ways share, found in the geometry already fetched (`roadJunctions.js`) — no
  second Overpass request, and an exact coordinate match rather than a radius,
  so a bridge over a street is correctly NOT a junction. A dot drives to a stop
  line `STOP_LINE_M` short of the junction ahead of it, `QUEUE_GAP_M` further
  back per dot already queued; it is never teleported onto its place. A dot
  with no room left stops where it stands rather than crossing on a red.
  Grade-separated classes and `junction=roundabout` never queue. `getStats()`
  publishes `signalHeldByPhase`, `signalDotsByPhase`, `signalGreenPhase`,
  `signalRedCrossings` and `stoppedDots`; `__qaRoads()`, `__qaDots()` and
  `__qaJunctions()` publish the model itself. All of it exists because no
  Cesium point primitive paints in headless software GL —
  `qa-traffic-signals.mjs` proves the model, not a pixel, and asserts at one
  crossing at a time as well as viewport-wide: a viewport-wide share can look
  healthy while the junction someone is watching still has both flows moving.
  What it deliberately does not model: junction geometry, turning movements,
  and local phase offsets.
- **Enabling Traffic enables the detection overlay.** `DETECTION_DEMANDING_LAYERS`
  (`ui.js`) is ORed into the Contacts detection claim rather than given its own
  snapshot: two owners each holding their own pre-state would restore each
  other's. Enabling takes a snapshot and applies the tactical preset (Dense @
  75 %); disabling replays the snapshot, so a viewer who had detection OFF gets
  OFF back. Driven from the layer-visibility stream and read through
  `isEffectivelyEnabled`, so a layer switched on as another mode's dependency
  gets the same brackets.
- Traffic runs in `sim` mode (white dots, class-table speeds capped by OSM
  `maxspeed`) unless `TOMTOM_API_KEY`
  is configured (env or Keychain `tomtom-api`/`api-key`), which enables `live` mode:
  TomTom flow vector tiles via the budget-governed `/api/tomtom` proxy
  (`.gev-cache/tomtom/`, 120 s TTL, `TOMTOM_DAILY_TILE_BUDGET` default 40k/day),
  decoded client-side (`flowTiles.js`), matched onto Overpass roads
  (`flowMatch.js`), and rendered as green/amber/red dot color + speed/density
  scaling (`trafficFlowStyle.js`); closures spawn no dots; unmatched roads stay
  white. Road fetch bounds center on the camera look-at point (`trafficBounds.js`).
- In live mode the layer has TWO halves that degrade separately. The DOTS need
  Overpass. The RIBBON (`flowRibbons.js`) does not: it draws TomTom's own
  polylines as one batched `GroundPolylinePrimitive`, so live congestion reaches
  the screen whether or not the road graph ever arrives. Measured 2026-09-10,
  Paris street band: 2 tiles / 78 KB / 3 942 segments / 9.4 ms to build the
  instances. The `FLUX TOMTOM` row chip (`setParams({flowRibbon:'off'})`) hides
  it. When there are no dots to count, `getRowControls().legend` reports the
  ribbon's per-bucket tally rather than zeroes over a painted map.
- Flow-tile zoom and the ribbon's road-class floor belong to the camera band
  (`ROAD_FETCH_TIERS.flowZoom` / `.ribbonMinClass`), because the band owns the
  box span. z12 over the metro band's 0.30° box is 30 tile requests for one
  viewport against an edge rule that allows 30 per 10 s for all of `/api`; z10
  covers it in 4. A flow tile does not thin out with altitude either — those
  four z10 tiles decode 27 080 segments over Paris — so the metro band keeps
  only motorway/major classes, the same narrowing its Overpass query already does.
- `flowTiles.js` joins concurrent requests for a tile already in flight
  (`stats.tilesJoined`): the decode cache only records a RESOLVED tile, so the
  ribbon warm-up and the road matcher used to miss and fetch the same tiles
  twice. Tile responses carry `Cache-Control: private, max-age=<remaining TTL>`
  (`private`, not `public`: staging is behind Basic auth and no shared cache may
  replay a tile past the gate). A 429 arms a cooldown that honours `Retry-After`
  and serves the last decode instead of hammering.
- A 429 names its author. The proxy stamps its own budget refusal
  (`x-tomtom-limit: budget`, `Retry-After` to the UTC day boundary), so
  `deriveTrafficFlowError` reports `TomTom daily budget reached` only for that
  one; a 429 raised in FRONT of the origin reads `Rate limited by the server,
  not by TomTom`, and an unlabelled one names the status without picking a side.
- The hosted origin reaches `overpass-api.de` over IPv6 ONLY — both of its IPv4
  addresses refuse the connection — so `deploy/vps/docker-compose.yml` declares
  an IPv6-enabled network. Without it the container silently falls through to
  the one community mirror it can reach, which answers 429, and `/api/overpass`
  returns 502 after 25 s. This is not a TomTom failure mode and must not be
  diagnosed as one.
- Development captures opened with `?trafficDebug=1` mint an interaction anchor
  from the exact `camera.changed` event that arms each debounced load, then emit
  scheduling-correlated User Timing entries for production `response.json`, road
  parse, flow-race, dot construction, heat-line rebuild, and next-post-render
  boundaries. Every trace is paired with the exact camera-change that scheduled
  its load; mismatches are counted drops. Cesium's `moveEnd` remains a diagnostic
  mark only: it arrives about 500 ms after stillness, typically after fetch has
  begun, and fetch never waits for it. Production builds remove the flag, hooks,
  counters, and timing labels.
- Voice debug log: `tail -f .gev-logs/realtime-conversations.jsonl` (gitignored).

Replay chase-camera updates run in Cesium `preUpdate` before scene traversal, preventing 3D-tile refinement stutter when the mission replay speed is reduced. Replay Ascent first gives the selected launch site a five-second tile-preparation hold before displaying the T-minus countdown. Replay ascent duration is mission-specific: disclosed insertion, SECO, or separation timing is compressed into the replay, while sparse records use reconstructed path length with bounded fallback timing instead of a universal fixed duration. Replay transitions directly from ascent to orbit; stage re-entry/recovery remains static contextual linework and is never a camera-tracked playback phase. The screen-space rocket/thrust symbol renders at 50% of its 92 × 138 px design box, while the separate callout text remains unchanged. Successful/upcoming selected missions show a current orbit marker: green for a reliable TLE match or amber and explicitly estimated when no live match exists. Failed launches show their source status and suppress live/estimated orbit markers and fallback rings. A retained Launch Library orbit is labeled as the planned target, an absent ascent is reported as unavailable, and replay-only controls remain hidden unless the selected mission has a rendered track; authoritative supplied trajectory points remain visible when present. Mission orbit primitives realign by model matrix each tick from the same current-GMST frame as their marker, preventing ring/marker drift; their host annotation reads the position cache updated in that same tick. During depth-dominant ascent segments, the replay rocket retains its last valid path-facing rotation rather than snapping toward the camera. Mission selection and replay overlays never call photoreal `sampleHeight()` from the render loop; the launch-zone ground primitive and precomputed surface-safe replay path avoid remote tile-refinement probes that previously caused a one-second globe texture pulse. The shared host replaces the former mission-label visibility churn and quadratic overlap loop; the layer's remaining frame sweep only culls native point/billboard geometry and refreshes selected UTC copy when its displayed second changes. Replay samples uneven path vertices by cumulative distance and normalizes camera-yaw easing to frame time.

Orbit replay framing uses one combined bounding sphere for Earth and every sample of the selected orbit. The camera derives its final range from that full envelope, while its look-at target retains a radial bias toward the moving vehicle rather than collapsing onto the singular Earth-center frame. Compact-orbit launchers therefore remain tracked during camera rotation, and highly eccentric transfer orbits still keep both the globe and their distant apogee arc visible. The orbital camera stays on one side of the mission's 3D orbit plane and uses the vehicle radial as visual up, so forward motion remains screen-left through polar/local-heading wraps instead of alternating left and right. The fixed-size cyan orbit dot retains one pixel scale throughout the pullback. While replay owns the camera, the selected launch-site host label is suppressed so it cannot duplicate or overlap the replay vehicle's DOM callout; cancel/completion restores it.

Mission ascent paths use a long cubic insertion transition that matches the incoming climb direction and the sampled orbit tangent. Because a Cartesian cubic can otherwise chord through the ellipsoid for some inclined insertion geometries, every blended sample preserves the original climb's smooth minimum-altitude envelope. This removes the artificial right-angle insertion corner and corresponding rocket heading snap without allowing the ascent path to enter the globe.

Insertion is source-aware: catalog-backed missions propagate the matched satellite to the historical insertion epoch. Projected missions have no authoritative historical phase, so their orbital plane starts over the launch site and follows a plausible launch azimuth—south-southwest for western North American sites and polar missions, eastward otherwise. The projected insertion advances only by the disclosed ascent duration or a ten-minute fallback, producing one continuous downrange climb into the forward orbit tangent instead of using UTC as an arbitrary phase and correcting through a 180-degree hook.

The reconstruction does not add a full revolution around Earth: ordinary launch vehicles use a gravity turn and downrange acceleration before orbital insertion, rather than spiraling around the planet during powered ascent.

At close range, the selected launch site's 500 m highlight is a single material-backed `GroundPrimitive` classified against both terrain and photoreal 3D Tiles. It has no fixed world-space height offset, so the translucent disc and rim remain draped across the rendered launch-site surface during tile refinement. A small render-state polygon depth bias keeps coplanar ring fragments above the photoreal mesh at low oblique angles without making the geometry float or drift.

The Space Missions roster prioritizes data-rich records using available mission, orbit, payload, trajectory, timeline, and recovery fields; launch time remains the tie-breaker.

When no live catalog track is available, the mission view marks the approximate orbital ring as `PROJECTED ORBIT` in purple and renders the ascent-to-insertion transfer in green; catalog-backed satellite orbits remain cyan.

The replay vehicle is a smaller solid cyan silhouette without the former orange flame; its initial pad anchor uses photoreal terrain, globe height, or launch elevation fallback so it remains above the surface during tile loading. Replay begins at a close launch-complex range so pad detail remains visible before the camera widens into the ascent context view. Its initial camera heading is perpendicular to the ascent/orbit direction for a profile view, then eases into tangent tracking. Small screen-space reprojection changes are damped for the animated marker on both ascent and orbit, while large camera or phase changes snap to the authoritative path position.
Space Missions keeps the Satellite layer available for catalog/TLE matching but suppresses its standalone fleet points and orbit rings. While those visuals are hidden, their per-frame dense propagation, one-second core point-buffer rewrite, and one-second orbit-matrix rotation are suspended; selected mission telemetry continues to propagate independently. The selected mission's live or estimated satellite marker uses fractional wall-clock time, so it moves continuously rather than creating a once-per-second position discontinuity and one-frame photoreal globe LOD pulse.

During ascent replay, the camera, Cesium callbacks, and HTML vehicle overlay share one replay sample per rendered frame. The tracked overlay is projected directly from that shared position instead of applying a second screen-space lag filter, preventing the vehicle and globe from repeatedly advancing and snapping back.

After the initial broadside launch profile, the ascent chase camera stays in a rear-quarter view about 30 degrees off the vehicle's forward path bearing, widening smoothly toward 45 degrees as orbit context appears. Cesium's `HeadingPitchRange` already places the camera opposite the supplied heading vector, so replay does not add a second 180-degree inversion; the trajectory therefore travels away toward the horizon while remaining visibly offset from the screen centerline.

During orbit replay, the camera continues following the selected vehicle but eases its look-at target down toward the vehicle's sub-satellite globe anchor. The range expands when necessary for high-altitude missions, keeping both Earth and the tracked label visible through the full revolution. The active replay clock clamps at the final orbital sample rather than wrapping to ascent progress zero; replay completion therefore leaves the final globe/orbit framing in place and does not return to the launch site.

Reconstructed mission orbits use a small downrange launch-to-insertion arc, so their estimated ground track is not artificially drawn directly over the launch pad in top-down views. The ascent remains connected to the ring at its selected insertion point.
Collapsed right-rail controls use the same 176 px width as collapsed left-rail controls, while expanded right-side detail panels retain their independent widths. DISPLAY starts collapsed on first run and then respects persistence; DISPLAY may remain open beside CCTV or Context, while CCTV and Context remain mutually exclusive without persisting forced collapses. Selecting a dedicated Context mode opens its right-side surface and clears unrelated layers after first snapshotting their exact state. Final exit restores the original enabled set and changed parameters. Cockpit View hides the right-side CCTV control because CCTV is not part of the cockpit rail. Airborne cockpit altitude uses the tracked aircraft's reported aviation MSL altitude, never the potentially negative Cesium terrain/ellipsoid render height; confirmed grounded contacts display `0 ft` without rewriting that source field. A cold photoreal floor shows `ACQUIRING SURFACE` for at most five seconds, then uses the source target-height fallback instead of freezing the camera indefinitely.
Replay transport uses one Play/Pause toggle plus Cancel. During ascent only the active thrust ring is visible; stage-recovery handoff uses a pulsing dot.

## Tooling Snapshot

- `tools/cesium-render.mjs`: headless Cesium render capture via Puppeteer.
- `tools/streetview-panorama.mjs`: Street View tile panorama stitcher.
- `tools/streetview-headings.mjs`: heading sweep capture; supports neighbor traversal.
- `tools/pano-pinhole.mjs`: equirectangular-to-pinhole reprojection.
- `tools/sat-ortho.mjs`: Map Tiles ortho stitch and centered crop with georef corners.
- `scripts/track-regression.mjs`: headless real-app regression harness for aircraft tracking/model/detection invariants (`npm run test:track`).
- `scripts/lib/qa-first-run.mjs`: the QA fleet's first-run suppression. Every
  `qa-*.mjs` opens its page with `newQaPage(browser)`, which writes the app's own
  per-session dismissal before any page script runs, so neither the card nor the
  bubble ever paints over a harness's clicks, pixels, or focus — the session seed
  hides every variant, C included, because all three pass through one door.
  `npm test` audits the fleet for it (`src/qaFirstRunSuppression.test.mjs`) — a
  new harness that forgets goes red with the fix in the message.
  `qa-firstrun.mjs` is the single exemption: the card is what it tests. By hand,
  `?welcome=0` on the app URL does the same.
- `scripts/qa-map-source-tray.mjs`: browser proof for the four-source Map Source
  tray — presentation, keyboard disclosure, responsive bounds, unpinned
  auto-dismiss, ACQUIRING status, and retired/unknown stack-id restore
  (`QA_BASE_URL=http://localhost:4173 npm run qa:map-source-tray`). Add
  `-- --keyless` to force the no-ion-token expectations on a keyed server; both
  invocations are gates.
- `scripts/qa-rnb-pivot.mjs`: the pivot re-measured against three live services,
  with no browser and no dev server (`npm run qa:rnb-pivot`, or
  `-- --box lyon`). It decodes the same BD TOPO tiles the layer would draw, with
  the layer's own module, and runs the map's own `joinPointsToBuildings` over
  them. Four checks per box: the tiles still carry `identifiants_rnb` (floor
  80 %, measured 95.5–99.2 %); the RNB's own `bdtopo` identifiers still match
  those tiles' `cleabs` (floor 98 %, measured 573/573 over Lyon 2e); the
  identity join still reaches more DPE rows than the geocoded dot (81.8 → 96.3 %
  Paris, 40.4 → 75.7 % Lyon, 78.8 → 88.9 % Marseille, 14.0 → 41.5 % Ustaritz);
  and, informationally, how many rows the dot was putting on a neighbour's roof.
  A service that is down reports "not testable here" rather than red — three
  upstreams is three ways to have a bad afternoon that says nothing about this
  repository.
- `scripts/qa-view-gate.mjs`: browser proof that a layer gated on a close camera
  is FLOWN there rather than told to zoom (`npm run qa:view-gate --
  --url http://localhost:4173`). Covers Bâti 3D and the mapped grid from a
  420 km camera, the share-restore origin that must keep its own camera, and
  the off-coverage view that must not be flown anywhere.
- `scripts/qa-cadastre-highlight.mjs`: browser proof that the SELECTED parcel's
  highlight covers that parcel and nothing else (`npm run qa:cadastre-highlight
  -- --url http://localhost:4173`). No unit test can see this one: the geometry
  handed to Cesium was right and only the pixels were wrong, because a batched
  `GroundPrimitive` colours a ground pixel by each instance's axis-aligned
  BOUNDING RECTANGLE (`CULL_FRAGMENTS` in `ShadowVolumeAppearanceFS.glsl`), not
  by its polygon. So the check is on pixels: the parcel's own rings are
  reprojected through the camera and compared with the highlight over Ustaritz
  AN 0512, from a nadir and an oblique camera, against a 0.90 floor on
  intersection over union and a 1.5 m bleed ceiling — 0.983 and 0.975 on the
  shipped build, 0.443 and 0.139 before the fix. It also reads `getPrimitiveShapeForQa()` so
  the fills stay batched per band colour: giving every parcel its own primitive
  would pass the pixel checks and cost the frame rate the layer is built around.
  Screenshots land in the gitignored `qa-shots/cadastre-highlight/`.
- `scripts/qa-l9-matrix.mjs`: the L9 release-candidate QA matrix in one command
  (`node scripts/qa-l9-matrix.mjs --url http://localhost:4173`). Orchestrates
  the `qa-*.mjs` fleet plus `track-regression` as subprocesses and adds
  repo/feed/in-browser probes; a check whose key the target lacks is SKIPPED
  with an OWNER-RUN tag rather than failed. Run with `--list` to print the
  manual checks it cannot automate.
