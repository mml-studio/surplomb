/**
 * @module data/emploiFeed
 *
 * **Emploi** — activity, employment and unemployment where people live, from
 * the census, at the finest geography INSEE publishes it.
 *
 * The second of Cityscan's ten themes on which this fork was at zero. Melodi
 * is INSEE's open-data API: keyless, one URL per dataset, already used by
 * `build-filosofi-territoires.mjs` for the national ramp. `DS_RP_EMPLOI_LR_PRINC`
 * carries 17 877 132 observations of the resident population aged 15 to 64 by
 * declared activity status, at **commune and arrondissement municipal** level
 * among others — so Paris 13e has its own figures, unlike four of the other
 * registers this fiche joins.
 *
 * ── Only the four codes arithmetic can vouch for ────────────────────────────
 * `EMPSTA_ENQ` publishes ten modalities and Melodi serves no code list this
 * module could read at runtime — `/catalog/codelist/...` is a 404, and the
 * `structure` field answers with a DSD name and nothing behind it. Rather than
 * hard-code labels from memory for the six inactive breakdowns, this module
 * reads the four whose meaning its own arithmetic pins down, and **checks the
 * two identities on every answer**:
 *
 *   `1` + `2` = `1T2`      employed + unemployed = active
 *   `1T2` + `3` = `_T`     active + inactive = the whole 15-64 population
 *
 * Measured on Paris 13e: both hold to 0,0 for all three census vintages. If a
 * future edition renumbered a modality, the identity would break and the
 * payload says so rather than publishing a rate computed on the wrong column.
 *
 * ── THE REFUSAL THAT MATTERS: a rate on four people is not a rate ───────────
 * La Haute-Beaume (05066), 2023 census: **1,75 active residents, of whom 1,75
 * are unemployed and 0,0 are employed**, out of 3,5 people aged 15 to 64.
 * Printed as a percentage that is a 100 % unemployment rate, and it is
 * nonsense — the values are weighted survey estimates, which is also why they
 * carry decimals.
 *
 * So a rate is computed only above {@link EMPLOI_RATE_FLOOR} active residents,
 * a floor chosen so that **one person cannot move the rate by a whole point**.
 * Below it the counts are still reported — they are real — and the rate is
 * refused in as many words. Cityscan grades every address; this one says when
 * it cannot.
 *
 * ── Scope: France hors Mayotte, and it answers HTTP 200 to prove it ─────────
 * Asking for `2026-COM-97611` (Mamoudzou) returns **200 with zero
 * observations**, not an error. That is out-of-scope, not missing data, and
 * the two must not read the same on a card. An unknown geography, by contrast,
 * is an HTTP 400 with a non-JSON body.
 *
 * ── Three vintages, which is a fact Cityscan's static score cannot carry ────
 * The dataset publishes 2012, 2017 and 2023 side by side. The direction of
 * travel at one address — Paris 13e went 11,8 % → 12,9 % → 11,9 % — is a
 * different and more useful statement than any single year's level.
 *
 * ── The level name has to be chosen before the URL is built ─────────────────
 * Melodi serves communes as `COM` and Paris/Lyon/Marseille arrondissements as
 * `ARM`. Handing it `2026-COM-75113` returns an empty answer, not an error.
 * See `communeCode.js`.
 *
 * Dependency-free and side-effect-free. The `/api/emploi-fr` proxy imports it.
