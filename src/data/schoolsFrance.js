/**
 * @module schoolsFrance
 *
 * Every school France has registered, answered at the scale you ask.
 *
 * The source is the MENJ's own **Annuaire de l'éducation**
 * (`fr-en-annuaire-education`, Licence Ouverte 2.0, rebuilt daily), read
 * keylessly through the dev-server proxy. Measured 2026-09-01: 68 939 rows,
 * of which **68 158 are open and carry a coordinate** — the set this layer
 * draws. `schoolsFeed.js` holds the reading of the register and every trap in
 * it; this file is the rendering.
 *
 * ── Three regimes, and what decides between them ────────────────────────────
 * The same ladder the charge-point layer settled on, for the same reason: one
 * answer cannot serve both "which parts of France" and "which building".
 *
 *   national — 96 département PRISMS: the height is the establishment count,
 *              the colour is the count per 1 000 km². Entered on the view's
 *              LATITUDE span (≥ 9.5°, metropolitan France being 9.8° tall),
 *              never on the larger of the two spans, which on a 16:10 viewport
 *              is mostly a statement about the window's shape.
 *   mesh     — real school positions, spatially thinned to 1 100–2 200 dots.
 *              The middle zooms, where a région fills the screen.
 *   sites    — every school in the box, with its card. Gated by the proxy's
 *              own 0.35° ceiling, which bites before the altitude gate does.
 *
 * ── What the colour means, and what the size means ──────────────────────────
 * In the two POSITION regimes (mesh, sites): colour is the school LEVEL —
 * école, collège, lycée, adapted, non-teaching — and it is a categorical
 * ladder by age, not a ramp. Size is the ROLL, joined from four separate
 * per-level datasets on the UAI.
 *
 * The national regime draws neither of those, because it draws no school: it
 * draws 96 territories, and a territory has no level and no roll. Its two
 * channels are the ones the next section argues for.
 *
 * The two are deliberately different kinds of thing, and the layer never lets
 * the second impersonate the first: **8.3% of teaching establishments have no
 * published roll** (measured — 5 235 of 62 918, mostly SEGPA and SEP sections
 * whose pupils are counted inside their parent school). Those draw at the base
 * size and their card says *effectif non publié*. A zero-sized dot, or a dot
 * silently drawn as if it held no pupils, would turn a gap in the roll files
 * into a claim about a school.
 *
 * ── The national regime is a PRISM, and the old argument was a false choice ─
 * This header used to argue that the national fill was binned on the number of
 * ESTABLISHMENTS rather than on the density, "because the layer draws
 * establishments and shading by anything else would be a different map wearing
 * the same legend". The reasoning was sound and the question was wrong: it
 * compared count-fill against density-fill — one channel, two candidates, one
 * loser — and painting a raw count as a colour fill is the fault the corpus
 * names in capitals (CARTOGRAPHY B1). On a globe there is a second channel
 * and it was empty. The answer is both, on two channels:
 *
 *   HEIGHT  the establishment count, linearly, from a common datum
 *           (`SCHOOLS_PRISM_SCALE`, and `choroplethPrism.js` for the grammar).
 *   COLOUR  the count per 1 000 km² of the polygon actually drawn — a ratio,
 *           which is the one thing a colour fill is allowed to say. It was
 *           already computed by `schoolsDepartements.js` and only ever printed
 *           on a card.
 *   ALPHA   nothing. It used to carry a compositing correction (the DESCENDING
 *           ladder in `choroplethAlpha.js`, which existed because the fill was
 *           blended over unknown imagery). A prism body is composited over the
 *           sky and over other prisms at a CONSTANT alpha, and constant alpha
 *           is what makes the ramp's lightness ordering survive every possible
 *           backdrop by construction: `0.62·c + 0.38·bg` is monotone in `c`
 *           whatever `bg` is. The ladder is deliberately not imported here.
 *
 * ── The measurements the scale is frozen on ─────────────────────────────────
 * Measured 2026-09-03 by running `projectSchoolsDepartements` over that day's
 * national export (68 158 open, geolocated rows) against this repo's own
 * bundled polygons — 65 396 assigned, 99 coastal snaps, 2 762 offshore, 96
 * départements with a count, none at zero:
 *
 *   count    150 (Lozère) → 2 504 (Nord), median 577. Dynamic range 1 : 16.7.
 *   density  29.0 (Lozère) → 14 303 (Paris) per 1 000 km², median 92.4.
 *            Range 1 : 493 — thirty times the count's spread, which is the
 *            arithmetic reason the two cannot share one channel.
 *
 * `domainMax` is frozen at 2 600 establishments (C1: a literal published here,
 * never `countBins()` re-derived from the rows in hand). Nord lands at 96 % of
 * the scale, 115.6 km, 111 px at national altitude; the median is 26.6 km,
 * 25.6 px; Lozère is 6.9 km, 6.7 px. The 4 km A1 floor bites below 87
 * establishments, so today it is armed and inactive — no département is small
 * enough to be flattened onto it, and that is what makes `'linear'` honest
 * here where `irve-fr` (1 : 46) has to declare `'sqrt'`.
 *
 * The 3.7 % of headroom above Nord is not decoration: the register is rebuilt
 * daily, and a domain pinned to the measured maximum would start clipping the
 * one département the whole scale is anchored on the first day a school opens
 * in Lille. Clipped today: 0, and `prismLegend` publishes the count if it ever
 * stops being 0 (A5).
 *
 * ── Why the colour is the density and not one of the other three ratios ─────
 * The payload carries four candidates. Density wins for a reason that is
 * structural rather than editorial: the prism's base is the département's own
 * polygon, so a big rural territory makes a big VOLUME at equal count, and the
 * single question that misreading produces — "is this pile tall because the
 * territory is large?" — is answered by count ÷ area and by nothing else. The
 * colour is the audit of the height, not its decoration.
 *
 * The measured proof that it works: Gironde and Yvelines both hold exactly
 * 1 416 establishments — the same height, to the metre — and land two colour
 * classes apart, 140.5 against 615.6 per 1 000 km². Paris (1 481) and
 * Seine-Maritime (1 362) are near-equal towers, 14 303 against 217.
 *
 * The three rejected:
 *   · pupils per establishment — the roll is unpublished for 8.3 % of teaching
 *     establishments (5 235 of 62 918), and unevenly so, because SEGPA and SEP
 *     sections are counted inside their parent school. The ratio would carry a
 *     coverage artefact in the same channel as the finding.
 *   · share in éducation prioritaire — a policy variable, not the denominator
 *     of the height, and it would put a social judgement in the colour of a map
 *     about where schools ARE.
 *   · private share — same objection, and it answers no question the height
 *     raises.
 *
 * ── What the prism refuses to say ───────────────────────────────────────────
 * It does not neutralise the base area: a reader who reads MASS rather than the
 * top edge still over-reads large rural départements. The prism moves that bias
 * from the fill to the volume rather than removing it, and hands over a second
 * channel to catch it — which the flat fill never did. The legend says so.
 *
 * It says nothing about pupils, nothing about the IPS, and it cannot say
 * anything at all about the 2 762 establishments below.
 *
 * ── What the national regime cannot show ────────────────────────────────────
 * The bundled département polygons are metropolitan: 96 features, no overseas
 * geometry. So 2 762 open, geolocated schools — La Réunion's 855, Guadeloupe's
 * 448, and the rest — cannot be painted, and the national card says so rather
 * than letting the choropleth imply France has 65 396 schools. They are all
 * present in the other two regimes, which draw positions and not polygons.
 *
 * A second absence is worth the same honesty and is stated on the same card:
 * **French Polynesia's 311 establishments and Wallis-et-Futuna's 21 carry no
 * coordinate at all** — every single one — as do 49 in New Caledonia. They are
 * 332 of the register's 399 uncoordinated rows, and they are not on this map
 * anywhere. Only 18 uncoordinated rows are metropolitan.
 *
 * ── What the IPS does NOT change ────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The DEPP's *indice de position sociale* is joined onto this layer on the UAI
 * (`ipsFeed.js`), and it moves NO map channel in any regime. Colour still
 * means level and size still means roll where schools are drawn; at national
 * altitude the height is a count and the colour a density, and the index is
 * neither. That is a decision and not an omission: every channel already
 * carries a meaning, and a second one behind a toggle would make two
 * screenshots of this layer say different things with nothing on screen to
 * tell them apart. The index arrives where it can be qualified — on the card,
 * and in the one line under the toggle — because **40 529 of the 62 857 drawn schools that can
 * carry an index have a published one (64.5%)** and the third that do not
 * must read as "non publié", never as the middle of a ramp.
 *
 * The maillage is deliberately untouched by it. The national pack ships
 * coordinates without names to stay at 1.66 MB against 5.42 MB, and an IPS
 * per tuple would put it back where the names did. So the index rides the
 * click path the NAME already uses: one register lookup for one coordinate,
 * memoised for the session, and the resulting card is the same card the exact
 * regime draws — IPS included.

 * The national legend: the height ruler, then the colour ladder, then what is

 *
 * D1 in full — where a colour and a height carry values, the key has to be
 * readable WITH the map, and a height without numbered ticks means nothing at
 * all. The two-part body comes from `prismLegend`, which is shared with the
 * three sibling prism layers so the grammar cannot drift between them.
 *
 * One entry is added here because it belongs to this layer alone: the
 * establishments that are on the register and cannot be on this map. 2 762 of
 * them (measured) fall outside every bundled polygon — La Réunion's 855,
 * Guadeloupe's 448, Martinique's 403 — and 99 metropolitan ones were pulled up
 * to 2 km onto the nearest département by the coastal snap. Both facts belong
 * next to the key that is being read, not in a status line the reader has to
 * find. A choropleth that omits them quietly is a map claiming France has
 * 65 396 schools.
 *
 * @param {object} national The national rollup.
 * @returns {Array<object>} Legend entries, in reading order.
