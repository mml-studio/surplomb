/**
 * Parcelles cadastrales (FR) — the lines France taxes land along, and what
 * they are actually worth.
 *
 * The Plan Cadastral Informatisé served through IGN's Api Carto: one polygon
 * per parcel, with its section, its number, its 14-character national
 * identifier and the surface the DGFiP has registered against it. Roughly 103
 * million parcels cover the country, so this layer never draws France — it is a
 * magnifying glass, and it says so by refusing to load above a 2 km viewport.
 *
 * ── The two things this layer is FOR ────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * • **A cadastral boundary is a fiscal line, not a legal one.** France fixes a
 *   property limit by bornage — a géomètre-expert's survey — and the cadastre
 *   has no authority over it. Every card says so on its last line, because a
 *   crisp polygon on a photorealistic globe is exactly the thing a reader will
 *   otherwise take for a surveyed limit.
 *
 * • **How approximate a line is, is PUBLISHED, and nobody draws it.** Each
 *   parcel belongs to a feuille, and the feuille carries the scale of the plan
 *   it was drawn on — 1:250 in central Strasbourg, 1:5000 over the Landes
 *   forest, a twentyfold spread measured across 673 sheets on 2026-09-01. Half
 *   a millimetre of pen at those scales is ±0.13 m and ±2.5 m, and it is the
 *   same "boundary" in both cases. That number is the colour of every parcel on
 *   screen and a line on every card.
 *
 * ── What the drawing is careful about ───────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * • **The holes are the streets.** The cadastre parcels PRIVATE land and the
 *   public domain that has been given a parcel; roads, squares and rivers have
 *   none, so a correct answer over a city centre is full of gaps. Measured
 *   2026-09-01 with the parcels clipped to the view: 45.7% of Lyon's Presqu'île
 *   is cadastred, 32.7% around the Champ-de-Mars, against 98.6% of a Landes
 *   forest block. The row reports that fraction so the gaps read as the public
 *   realm rather than as a broken layer.
 *
 * • **A short answer is refused, not drawn.** Api Carto caps every request at
 *   5 000 features and reports the truncation only in `totalFeatures`. The
 *   missing parcels are scattered rather than cropped, so a truncated draw
 *   would be indistinguishable from the gaps above — the one failure that would
 *   turn the sentence before this one into a lie. Over the cap the layer draws
 *   nothing and prints the true count.
 *
 * • **Fills carry the sheet, outlines carry the parcel.** Neighbours on one
 *   feuille share a colour by construction, so a fill-only draw of a city block
 *   is one flat wash; the ground-clamped outline is what makes it a cadastre.
 *   Both are classification geometry, so they drape on IGN ortho, on Bing and
 *   on the Google photoreal tileset without a second code path.

 * pass only records "some instance in this batch covers this ground pixel" —
 * and then the colour pass keeps the FIRST instance whose 8 km-tall shadow
 * volume rasterises over the pixel and whose own *axis-aligned bounding
 * rectangle* contains it (`ShadowVolumeAppearanceFS.glsl`, `CULL_FRAGMENTS`).
 * A parcel's bounding rectangle overlaps its neighbours' constantly, so within
 * one batch neighbours repaint each other along rectangle edges.
 *
 * That is invisible while every instance in a batch carries the SAME colour —
 * whichever one wins the pixel, the answer is identical, and the stencil still
 * confines the union to the real polygons. It is glaring the moment one
 * instance differs, which is exactly what selection used to do: recolouring
 * the clicked parcel in place drew a cyan wedge with vertical and horizontal
 * edges belonging to the NEIGHBOUR's bounding box, on a parcel whose outline
 * beside it was perfectly square. Measured over Ustaritz on 2026-09-02, parcel
 * AN 0512: the two cuts through the highlight sat on AN 0511's east and north
 * bounding-box edges to within one pixel.
 *
 * So: one primitive per band colour — four scale bands plus the unknown one,
 * so at most five for a viewport that today holds two thousand parcels — and
