/**
 * Avis de valeur — the one piece of Cityscan that is not a data licence.
 *
 * WHAT THIS IS. Given a point, a dwelling type and a surface, this module reads
 * the DVF editions already in hand and answers what that dwelling is worth,
 * with the interval it is worth it inside. The Cityscan teardown (#99) puts the
 * estimator at the top of palier 2 and says why: of the eleven data routes
 * behind `app.cityscan.fr`, not one carries a source we do not already have —
 * their own translation file credits *« Source : Algorithme »* for exactly one
 * module, the estimate. The register is public, the arithmetic is not. This
 * file is the arithmetic, written down.
 *
 * ── THE RULE THIS FILE IS ORGANISED AROUND ──────────────────────────────────
 *
 * **A price is never published without the interval it sits in, and the
 * interval is never published without saying which uncertainty it measures.**
 * Two different ones are computed here and they are never merged:
 *
 *  · `prixM2.p25`–`prixM2.p75` — WHERE COMPARABLE GOODS ACTUALLY TRADED, per
 *    square metre. Half the retained sales landed inside it. It does not shrink
 *    with more data, because it is not an error bar: it is the market's own
 *    spread. It is also NOT a bound on the subject — a central 50 % band of
 *    comparable sales says nothing about where one particular flat's floor,
 *    state, view and orientation put it, and claiming it does would be the
 *    quiet way of turning a description into a promise. This is the band a
 *    seller reads; it is not a range this dwelling is guaranteed to sell in.
 *
 *  · `prixM2.ci90` — HOW WELL THE CENTRE ITSELF IS KNOWN. A distribution-free
 *    interval for the median, taken from the order statistics of the retained
 *    sample (below). It shrinks as comparables accumulate. It is an interval
 *    about the LOCAL MARKET'S MEDIAN, not about the subject: it says how firm
 *    the middle of the band is, not where in the band this particular flat is.
 *
 * A product that prints one number and calls it an estimate has collapsed both
 * of these into a decoration.
 *
 * ── THE THREE ANSWERS, AND WHY THE FLOOR IS FIVE ────────────────────────────
 *
 * `basis` is `'comparables'`, `'range'` or `'none'`, and the three are three
 * different sentences, never one dressed as another (A1):
 *
 *  · `'comparables'` — a centre and a band.
 *  · `'range'` — the band, and NO centre, because the centre is not known well
 *    enough to print as a number. Said out loud, with the reason.
 *  · `'none'` — nothing. Not "0 €", not the commune median borrowed silently.
 *
 * The floor of five is DERIVED, not chosen. The interval on the median is the
 * classical distribution-free one: for a sample of `n`, `[x(k), x(n+1-k)]`
 * covers the population median with probability `1 - 2·P(Bin(n, ½) < k)`. At
 * n = 4 the widest such interval — the whole sample, min to max — covers only
 * 87.5 %, so **no 90 % interval exists at all**; at n = 5 it is 93.8 %. Five is
 * where the arithmetic starts, so five is where the answer starts. The rank
 * table this produces, for α = 0.10:
 *
 *   n     4  →  no interval        n   12  →  [x₂, x₉]     96.1 %
 *   n     5  →  [x₀, x₄]   93.8 %  n   20  →  [x₅, x₁₄]    95.9 %
 *   n     6  →  [x₀, x₅]   96.9 %  n   30  →  [x₁₀, x₁₉]   90.1 %
 *   n     8  →  [x₁, x₆]   93.0 %  n   50  →  [x₁₈, x₃₁]   93.5 %
 *
 * Those are nominal coverages, and nominal coverage is a promise a fixture can
 * call. Resampled 3 000 times from the 4 192 Paris 13e flat sales of editions
 * 2023–2025, the interval covered the true median **93.6 % of the time at
 * n = 5, 93.0 % at n = 8, 96.9 % at n = 12, 90.8 % at n = 30** — every one of
 * them within a point of what the binomial says. Measured over Rodez's 1 214
 * sales as well: 94.2 / 92.9 / 95.9 / 89.8. The interval is calibrated on the
 * actual shape of French price data, not merely asserted.
 *
 * Its WIDTH at that floor is the reason the floor alone is not enough: at
 * n = 5 the interval spans **±26 % of the median in Paris and ±33 % in Rodez**,
 * and that is the symmetric reading — the further of its two ends is worse
 * still. Which is why a second gate decides whether the centre is printed.
 *
 * ── THE GATE ON THE CENTRE, IN TWO CLAUSES ──────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A centre is printed only when both hold:
 *
 *  1. **The centre is known STRICTLY better than the market's own spread** —
 *     the 90 % interval on the median is narrower than `p75 - p25`. If we know
 *     the middle no more precisely than the market is dispersed, the middle
 *     adds nothing the band was not already saying. This clause has no constant
 *     in it; it compares the two intervals the answer already carries.
 *
 *     Strictly, because the equality case is the degenerate one: a sample with
 *     no spread has `p75 - p25 = 0` and an interval of width 0, and a `>`
 *     comparison published « 1 000 €/m², ±0 % » from twelve identical prices
 *     with 96 % confidence attached. Measured on the two-atom law below,
 *     tightening `>` to `>=` lifted coverage across all rungs from 82.3 % to
 *     89.8 % and halved the number of centres published, while moving the
 *     measured coverage on real French price laws by at most 0.5 point.
 *  2. **±20 % of the median, at most — measured at the FURTHER endpoint.** A
 *     reader's floor, not a statistician's: a number that could be a fifth out
 *     is not a number. It is the clause that fires where clause 1 passes on a
 *     market so wide that both intervals are useless together.
 *
 *     Gating on HALF THE WIDTH, which is what this did first, is wrong on an
 *     interval built from order statistics: twenty comparables at 600 × 6,
 *     1 000 × 10 and 1 400 × 4 give a median of 1 000 and an interval of
 *     [600, 1 000] — half-width 20 %, lower endpoint **40 % below the median**
 *     — and the card then printed « ±20 % » over it. Both ends are published
 *     separately ({@link ciDeviationPct}) for the same reason.
 *
 * Measured on real ground, the two clauses catch different things. Around
 * Aurillac at 300 m, 43 sales give a median of 973 €/m² at ±22.6 % — clause 1
 * passes, clause 2 rejects, the ladder widens to 600 m and answers 1 333 €/m²
 * at ±8.2 %. The 300 m answer was not merely imprecise: it was 37 % away from
 * the one 159 sales agree on. At Biarritz (64547) 1 500 m gives 7 sales, ±33 %,
 * an interval WIDER than the interquartile range — clause 1 rejects, the
 * commune rung answers 4 127 €/m² at ±6.9 %.
 *
 * ── WHAT THE INTERVAL ASSUMES, AND WHAT SELECTING A RUNG COSTS IT ───────────
 *
 * Two disclosures the arithmetic does not make on its own.
 *
 * **"Distribution-free" removes an assumption about SHAPE, not about SAMPLING.**
 * The interval is exact for `n` INDEPENDENT draws from a population. The
 * comparables are not that: they are a near-census of the transactions that
 * happened to occur in one pocket over three editions. So the honest reading is
 * a model — *the sales observed behave as an independent draw from the price
 * law of this pocket* — and the interval is exact under it, not under the world.
 * What the interval is emphatically NOT is a statement about the subject: it
 * bounds the MEDIAN of a local market, and the individual dwelling's floor,
 * state, view and orientation are not in it. That is what the p25–p75 band is
 * for, and even that is a description of where comparable goods traded, never a
 * bound on this one.
 *
 * **The rung is chosen with the same prices that then set the interval's
 * width**, which is a selection effect and can only lower the real coverage.
 * Measured, by resampling each commune's OWN price law onto its OWN geography,
 * 4 000 draws each: post-selection coverage **92.5 % (Paris 13e, flat 60 m²),
 * 91.9 % (Rodez, flat 65 m²), 92.0 % (Rodez, house 110 m²), 92.8 % (Biarritz,
 * house 110 m²)** against nominals of 90.1 to 96.9 %. On real French price laws
 * the ladder costs a point or two, no more.
 *
 * On a law built to break it, it costs everything. Two atoms — 49.5 % at
 * 1 000 €/m², 49.5 % at 10 000, population median 5 500 with almost no
 * observation near it — and the same procedure over 10 000 draws covers 89.8 %
 * across all rungs and **0 % across the 931 centres it agrees to publish**: the
 * gate keeps exactly the samples that landed wholly on one atom. No in-sample
 * test can catch it, and that is the point worth writing down rather than
 * patching — those samples are not internally suspicious, they are simply
 * unrepresentative draws. The shape that produces it is a commune whose two
 * halves are two markets (a seafront and a back country, a resort and its
 * valley), and it is the shape to distrust this number on.
 *
 * ── THE LADDER, AND WHY DISTANCE WIDENS BEFORE SURFACE ──────────────────────
 *
 * {@link AVIS_RUNGS} walks from "this block" to "this commune", and the order
 * is a measured decision rather than a taste. Widening the SURFACE BAND is the
 * expensive move, because price per square metre falls with size and the bias
 * lands inside the median without ever showing:
 *
 *   flats near 60 m², median €/m² below 60 m² against at or above it,
 *   editions 2023–2025 —
 *     band ±20 %   Paris 13e −3.0 %   Lille −4.0 %   Ajaccio −13.3 %
 *     band ±35 %   Paris 13e −3.6 %   Lille −10.7 %  Ajaccio −20.4 %
 *
 * Widening the RADIUS costs the "is this dear for HERE" premise, which is a
 * real cost — but it is a cost the answer DECLARES: the radius is printed, the
 * comparables are drawn, and the reader sees the reach that produced the
 * number. A surface bias is invisible. So the ladder spends distance first and
 * only reaches for ±35 % when the whole commune at ±20 % has not delivered.
 *
 * ── WHAT IS EXCLUDED, AND COUNTED ───────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `dvfFeed.js` already refuses a price per square metre for anything that did
 * not buy exactly one dwelling — the 179-lot block sale, the flat sold with a
 * shop, the €2,295 swap. Two exclusions are added here:
 *
 *  · **VEFA.** A *vente en l'état futur d'achèvement* is a sale of a dwelling
 *    that does not exist yet: it carries a delivery delay, a builder's
 *    warranty and reduced transfer duties, and it is not the market a standing
 *    flat trades in. Measured on Paris 13e over editions 2021–2025, 225 VEFA
 *    mutations, of which **9 carry a €/m² at all** — and those nine price at
 *    **13 077 €/m² against 9 150 for ordinary resale, +43 %**. Excluding them
 *    costs nine comparables out of 7 468 and removes a systematic bias. They
 *    are counted in `excluded.vefa` and named, because a count nobody sees is
 *    an exclusion nobody can argue with.
 *
 *  · **The other dwelling type.** A house and a flat do not share a €/m². The
 *    house's price also carries its plot, which is why {@link projectAvisValeur}
 *    reports the retained sample's median `terrain` for `Maison` rather than
 *    pretending the plot was normalised: it was not.
 *
 *  · **The one-euro flat.** `valeur_fonciere` is sometimes 1, and `round(1/40)`
 *    is **0, not null** — so the ratio survives every guard `dvfFeed.js` has
 *    and arrives here as a number. Measured over editions 2023–2025: **7 such
 *    mutations in Paris 13e, 6 in Bordeaux, 6 in Lille, 1 in Aurillac**, among
 *    them a 166 m² flat on place Pinel declared at one euro. They are excluded
 *    and counted in `excluded.zeroPrice`.
 *
 * WHAT IS **NOT** EXCLUDED, and this is a decision rather than an oversight:
 * the low tail above zero. Across 31 609 priced resales in nine communes, the
 * declared values run 1 € → 160 € → 400 € → 1 800 € → 3 000 € → 4 950 € →
 * 20 000 € with **no break anywhere** — 0.06 % at or below 1 €, 0.16 % at or
 * below 1 000 €, 0.44 % at or below 10 000 €. Any cut drawn in that continuum
 * would be a plausibility model wearing a constant's clothes, and it would
 * delete real sales: a 132 m² house at 38 €/m² in the Pyrénées-Atlantiques and
 * a 417 €/m² house in the Lozère are both in the register and both are
 * somebody's actual transaction. The median and the quartiles absorb a 0.4 %
 * contamination on their own, and the answer REPORTS what it kept —
 * `symbolicCount` counts the retained comparables declared under
 * {@link AVIS_SYMBOLIC_VALUE_EUR} — so a thin sample carrying one is visible
 * rather than quietly averaged.
 *
 * ── THE INDEX THAT IS NOT HERE, AND THE MEASUREMENT THAT KILLED IT ──────────
 *
 * The obvious next move is to restate every comparable in the money of the most
 * recent edition, through a commune-year index. It was measured, and it is not
 * worth its own noise over a three-edition window.
 *
 * The drift to correct, commune median €/m² 2023 → 2025: **Paris 13e −4.3 %,
 * Bordeaux −9.2 %, Lille −3.6 %, Rodez −0.5 %, Ajaccio +1.6 %.** A median
 * comparable in a three-edition window is about eighteen months old, so the
 * residual bias of not correcting is roughly half of that — **2 to 5 %.**
 *
 * The noise the correction would add: a commune-year median is itself a median
 * of a sample, and the same interval computed above puts it at **±7 to ±11 % at
 * 30 sales in the year, ±6 to ±10 % at 50.** Dividing one noisy median by
 * another to fix a 4 % drift injects more error than it removes everywhere
 * except in the handful of communes with four-figure yearly volumes.
 *
 * So the drift is **measured and printed instead of applied** ({@link
 * communeDrift}): the card carries the commune's own per-edition medians, and
 * when the window has moved by {@link AVIS_DRIFT_LOUD_PCT} or more the answer
 * says so in its own field rather than burying it. A reader who can see
 * −9.2 % over three years knows what an eighteen-month-old comparable is worth;
 * a reader handed a silently "corrected" number knows nothing at all.
 *
 * ── THE HOLE IN THE REGISTER NOBODY ANNOUNCES ───────────────────────────────
 *
 * DVF does not cover the Bas-Rhin, the Haut-Rhin, the Moselle or Mayotte — the
 * *livre foncier* départements, whose transfers are recorded by a different
 * administration. Measured 2026-09-08 on the 2024 edition: `67482` (Strasbourg),
 * `57463` (Metz), `68224` (Mulhouse) and `97611` (Mamoudzou) all answer **404**,
 * while `97411` (Saint-Denis de La Réunion) answers 200 with 647 KB. That is
 * three million people for whom the honest answer is "the register does not
 * reach here", and it is emphatically NOT the same sentence as "no comparable
 * sale was found". {@link dvfCoverage} separates them, and `basis: 'none'`
 * carries the reason.
 *
 * Dependency-free and side-effect-free. The `/api/avis-valeur` proxy imports
 * this; nothing in the browser bundle does.
