## [Unreleased] — 2026-09-15

### Added
- **A search marks what it found, as a map search does.** An address, a
  building or a monument gets a red pin with its name beside it; a town, a
  département or a région gets its limits drawn on the ground (« Biarritz »,
  « Pyrénées-Atlantiques », « Nouvelle-Aquitaine »). The city shortcuts outline
  their town and the landmarks get a pin. Emptying the search field, « Autour
  de moi » or the next search takes the mark away. In France the limits come
  from the State's commune contours and IGN's départements; elsewhere from
  OpenStreetMap. They are simplified, not the legal limits.
- **A Lyon traffic camera now plays its last hour instead of showing one
  still.** The Métropole de Lyon publishes one picture per camera, replaced
  about once a minute, and keeps no past. The server now records those
  pictures (a 640-pixel copy, one a minute, the last 60 minutes) and the
  camera panel plays them back at eight a second, pausing on the newest one,
  with the two clock times it covers on either side of a scrubber
  (« 10:26 ─●─ 11:26 ») and the time of the frame on screen in the corner of
  the picture. Play/pause and the scrubber stop on any minute. Until five
  minutes are recorded the panel shows the live picture and says the
  timelapse is being built; « AGRANDIR » still opens the live picture at full
  resolution. Only cameras whose publisher sends real pictures have one — in
  France, the fifteen Lyon cameras; cameras mapped on OpenStreetMap publish
  none.
- **Digital infrastructure now opens on a dimmed satellite ground, and gives
  your map back when you switch it off.** Switching « Infrastructure
  numérique » on moves the map to the new « Crépuscule » (Dusk) style — the
  ground dimmed a little, every layer in full colour, bright marks glowing —
  and to the Satellite basemap; switching it off returns to Normal and to the
  basemap you had. While the row is on, the other basemaps are greyed out and
  a line under them says why. Dusk replaces Snow in the visual presets, on key
  7.
- **Antennas are glowing triangles, and a selected mast's line of sight is
  lit ground.** The masts are amber (5G) and steel triangles with a halo; the
  selected one is an amber diamond. The ground it can see is drawn in two
  blues with the relief showing through and a bright edge where the view is
  blocked, instead of a flat cyan sheet.
- **Data centres are violet sparkles, grouped where they crowd.** The tall
  cyan beams and the wall of cards are gone: each site is a sparkle on a short
  faint stem, sites that share a spot at the national scale merge into one
  stacked mark, and only the few most powerful sites are named, with their
  power (« Colt Paris 3 · 85 MW »). The key explains the two marks.
  Clicking a site no longer flies the camera: its card opens in the key —
  the power as its figure, who published it, the year, and a link to the
  operator's website when there is one — and the site turns amber on the
  map.
- **The mobile antennas now show where their 4G reaches, and where it does
  not.** Five chips on the Antennes mobiles row paint the ARCEP's quarterly
  coverage map under the masts: « Zones blanches » colours the ground by how
  many of the four operators reach it — darkest where none does, even at
  limited coverage — and Orange, SFR, Bouygues and Free each show their own
  gaps and limited areas. Fully served ground stays unpainted, so the dead
  zones stand out: 1.0 % of mainland France in the 2026 Q1 edition, most of it
  in the Alps, the Pyrenees and Corsica. Clicking the ground answers in one line —
  « Zone blanche : pas de 4G ici », « Seul Orange capte ici » — then gives each
  operator's level in everyday words. The map is the operators' own estimate,
  published by ARCEP, and every surface says so; it is drawn on every
  basemap, Google 3D included. The chosen view travels in shared links.
- **A selected mast shows what it can see.** Selecting a mast now lights, in
  the selection cyan, the ground from which the top of the mast is in view —
  over the terrain, out to the radio horizon its registered height allows
  (27.6 km for a typical 30 m mast). The card gives the share of that disc in
  view (« Visible depuis 2 % du terrain dans un rayon de 28 km »), and the key
  says it is worked out from the relief alone, without buildings or trees.
- **The antenna cards and key read at first glance.** A mast's card is now five
  short lines: what it is and how many operators (« Antenne 5G · 4
  opérateurs »), their names, the networks on the air, what it stands on and
  where (« Sur un toit, à 65 m de haut · Paris 6e »), and the nearest wave
  measurement as a multiple of the legal limit, flagged when it predates the
  current antennas. Frequencies, antenna counts, the owner, the register
  number and the licence are gone from it. The key names each colour in two or
  three words — « Antenne 5G », « En projet, n’émet pas » — without the national
  statistics that used to follow every swatch.
- **The globe says when a model is talking.** A small « IA » badge (« AI » in
  English) now sits on the microphone's ring, upper left, on every screen
  size — phones included, and with the dock's panels open — beside the
  premium crown where the hosted demo shows one. Pointing at it, or a screen
  reader, gives the full sentence: « Assistant d’intelligence artificielle —
  voix de synthèse » (“Artificial intelligence assistant — synthetic voice”).
  The HUD summary line wears the same badge while its words come from the
  model (« Résumé rédigé par une intelligence artificielle (OpenAI) ») and
  drops it while the local telemetry line stands in. Both texts are also
  marked `data-ai-generated="true"` for machines, as is the assistant's side
  of the voice transcript. This is the disclosure the EU AI Act (article
  50(1)) asks for since 2026-08-02; the old `AI AGENT` lettering was English
  only, 0 px wide on a desktop and hidden on phones.
- **Terms of sale for the paid offer, at `/cgv`.** The *conditions générales
  de vente* say who sells (the site's publisher, read from the same settings
  as the legal notice), that the offer is for professionals only, what is sold
  and what stays free, how the monthly subscription renews and is cancelled,
  the late-payment penalties French law requires, and what the data, the
  valuations and the AI answers do not promise. A notice at the top says the
  paid offer is not open yet: nothing can be bought today. The page is French
  in both languages, like the other two legal pages; the landing page's
  footer, the globe's credit line and the two other legal pages link to it
  (« CGV », “Terms of sale”).
- **The landing page speaks English.** A browser in English now opens the
  landing page in English, like the globe, and an EN / FR pill in the header
  switches between the two (it remembers the choice, and the address stays
  `/`). Every sentence, label and picture description is translated; the
  English page carries no waitlist and no « premium », and its footer credits
  the project the globe is built on: God's Eye View, the open-source globe
  created by Bilawal Sidhu. The tab reads « Surplomb — France, X-rayed. », and
  the French never flashes before the English.
- **The globe's logo leads back to the landing page.** Pressing the Surplomb
  mark in the top-left corner asks « Revenir à la page d'accueil ? » (“Go back
  to the home page?”) with Annuler and Confirmer; confirming opens the landing
  page, and the browser's Back button returns to the same view of the globe.
  Opening the logo in a new tab asks nothing.
- **« Choisissez une vue. » is one scene that moves on by itself.** The six
  tiles in their ivory panel became one picture at the full width of the page,
  straight on the city, with the interface on its edges: the heading top left,
  the view's title and place bottom left, « Ouvrir dans le globe » bottom
  right, and a bar of six tabs under it — Avions, Immobilier, Trafic, Énergie,
  Bus, Vélos. Resting the pointer on a tab (or clicking, tapping, or using the
  arrow keys) shows its view from the beginning of its story — Énergie opens
  on a dark Europe and France switches on, rather than wherever the film had
  stopped; otherwise the views advance on their own, each for a whole
  recording — 29 s for Roissy, 14.7 s for the power grid, 12 s (two passes)
  for the others — and the active tab's underline fills in that time. The
  clock waits until the scene is on screen, holds while the pointer rests on
  it, and stops with « Mettre en pause » or « Image fixe »; reduced motion
  starts paused. On a phone the scene has no button of its own — the docked
  « Ouvrir le globe » is already there — only an arrow on the picture, which
  is the link. Only the view on stage and the next one are downloaded until the
  reader reaches for the tabs, and a phone takes the 960 px files instead of
  the 1440 (5.2 MB for Roissy). The films' enlargement under the pointer,
  listed below, goes with the tiles: the scene is already full width.
- **The energy ratings read like the label on a listing, and a click on one
  opens its card in the map key.** Each address carries a filled plate in its
  class colour with the letter in dark ink, and plates that would stand on one
  another fold into one pill that gives the group's range and count — « C–G ·
  33 »; clicking a pill brings the camera closer until they part. Clicking an
  address outlines its building and parcel in white, tags it « C–E · 16 » on
  the map, and prints in the key the street, the number of ratings, the classes
  present and their range, the most frequent class (a tie is named), and every
  rating filed there, each linked to its page on the ADEME observatory. The
  key's seven letters are now a filter: one press shows that class alone, the
  next ones add or remove a class, and the counts stay those of everything
  loaded.
- **The landing page's property view is the Lyon film: the sales, then the
  energy ratings.** « Immobilier » (“Property”) played six seconds of a sale
  card over place des Jacobins; it now plays a 10-second film shot on the
  photorealistic globe: a dive from high over the Presqu'île onto the
  Hôtel de Ville, the property sales (DVF) around it, one of them pinned —
  €410,000, a 68 m² flat sold in October 2025 — then a line that sweeps the
  district, putting the sales out behind it and painting every rated parcel
  in its energy class (DPE), and a climb over the repainted district, the
  same building now reading « 14 energy ratings · C to G ». The view is
  titled « Ventes et DPE » (“Sales and energy ratings”), plays once for its
  10 seconds, and « Ouvrir dans le globe » opens the film's last frame:
  the energy ratings over the Terreaux from 693 m. The thumbnail opens mid-
  sweep, sales on one side and ratings on the other, so a reader who keeps
  still images sees both.
- **The landing page's power-grid view is the power-grid film, and it grows
  under the pointer.** « Le réseau électrique et ce qu'il produit » showed a
  daytime take from before the view's night rework; it now plays the
  14.7-second film: France lighting up inside a dark Europe, the nuclear
  plants' columns filling to their live output, the dive onto Cruas and its
  card, and the country switching off. The thumbnail opens on the filled
  columns, so a reader who keeps still images sees the grid lit, not an
  unlit Europe. It enlarges like the Roissy film.
- **The landing page's Roissy view is the Roissy film, and it grows under the
  pointer.** The « Roissy et les avions en approche » thumbnail played six
  seconds of a nearly still camera; it now plays the 29-second scene cut from
  the app — the terminals, the take-off down 09R, a departure followed into
  its Cockpit, the climb to the noise plan — at the thumbnail's own
  definition. Resting the pointer on it (or reaching it with the keyboard)
  enlarges it to about twice its size, kept on screen, over dimmed
  neighbours; the film does not stop, and swaps to a sharper file at the same
  instant when the thumbnail's one would be blown up. A phone never enlarges
  it: a tap is still the link to the globe.
- **Click a slowed or jammed stretch of road to read it.** The coloured
  TomTom ribbon now opens a card on the stretch under the pointer: its kind of
  road, its state, the share of its free-flow speed it is moving at (« roule à
  35 % de sa vitesse sans trafic » — TomTom sends a ratio, so no km/h is
  invented), when TomTom sent it, and that the cars on it are simulated. The
  stretch is redrawn wider in its own colour; Escape or a click elsewhere
  closes it. Free-flowing roads do not open a card, so clicking the map to
  close something else still does just that.
- **A still camera keeps getting fresh traffic.** The flow used to be fetched
  only when the camera moved; a parked view now re-asks every 125 s (just
  after the caches behind it expire), recolours the cars in place and keeps
  the old ribbon on screen until the new one is built, with no loading flash.
  It stops after about ten minutes without a camera move, or while the tab is
  hidden, so a forgotten tab cannot spend the shared TomTom budget.
- **Road events now cover the conceded motorways on the hosted globe.** The
  Événements routiers layer drew the State-run network only: ASF, APRR,
  Cofiroute, Sanef, Escota and Aréa publish their accidents, closures and
  roadworks behind Bison Futé's *Action b* reuse licence, which Surplomb now
  holds. Where the login is configured (`BISON_FUTE_RESTRICTED_USER` /
  `BISON_FUTE_RESTRICTED_PASSWORD`), the server replays that real-time stream —
  a rolling directory of ~2 200 one-situation messages — into the current
  state, merges it with the open DIR feed on Tipi's situation ids, and serves
  both from the same route. Each motorway card reads « Information fournie par
  ASF · mise à jour 10:45 », as the licence requires; an ended situation is
  deleted rather than kept, since the licence covers an event only until it
  ends, and the row says *RRN, autoroutes concédées comprises*. The origin is
  read at most once a second, under a User-Agent that names the project, and
  its index every five minutes (22 KB gzipped). Without the login nothing changes: the open-source build draws the
  State-run network, as before.
- **« Le réseau électrique et ce qu'il produit » opens on a night map, with
  the power stations standing in relief.** The scene link now looks north up
  the Rhône valley from 180 km at 58° instead of straight down from 110 km,
  and asks for the Noir preset. Between 70 and 800 km of altitude each station
  is a translucent CAGE as tall as its installed power with a solid COLUMN
  inside as tall as its output, on one fixed scale (10 m per MW: Cruas's
  3,660 MW stand 36.6 km tall), and the filière's mark stands on top — for
  nuclear, the cooling tower with the trefoil punched through it, never the
  bare trefoil, which is a hazard sign. The ring's grammar survives the change
  of shape: a faint empty cage is unmeasured, a crisp empty cage is stopped, a
  pink column is a station drawing from the grid. Closer than 70 km or past
  800 km the stations turn back into rings. In relief the labels drop the kind
  of plant the mark already says: *Bugey · 3 418 MW / 3 580 MW*. The
  landing page's moving thumbnail for this view still shows the old daytime,
  straight-down take until it is re-recorded.
- **A scene that rides a departure out of Roissy and lands on France's noise
  law.** The Scenes panel gains *Roissy Departures and Noise Exposure Plan*:
  Terminal 1 in the photorealistic mesh, turning slowly; a low move to the 09R
  threshold and a take-off run down it, 15 m above the runway; a jump over the
  runway end onto a live departure, followed, then ridden in Cockpit; a climb to
  15 km where the noise exposure plan (PEB) and the noise nuisance plan (PGS)
  light up under its track. To play it, scenes learned five things: a layer that
  switches on mid-scene, a slow turn during a hold, a flight's easing and
  ceiling, following a live aircraft, and entering Cockpit.
- **The globe is bilingual, layer by layer, and the voice with it.** Every
  panel, card, legend, status and refusal now exists in French and in English:
  the shell, the 60-layer registry, the Address X-ray, real estate, transport,
  energy, planning, crime and schools, health, amenities and telecoms, risks
  and weather, the phone sheet, the hosted trial and the waitlist. The voice
  follows the page too — the model is told which language to speak, its
  vocabulary answers to « montre les médecins » and to *show the doctors* in
  either locale, and the server's errors travel as codes the browser words.
  4,611 French strings outside catalogs at the start of the campaign, 46 left
  (layer registry fallbacks and the French landing page, which stays French on
  purpose). French output is unchanged, to the byte, everywhere.
  Some defects only a translation finds went with it: a layer that crashed on
  boot in English, a compass rose that stayed French (`O` where an English
  reader expects `W`), a date that read as the fourth of March in English and
  the third of April in French, plurals that printed `0 ring` and
  `1 substations`, and a tree legend whose labels were baked into a server
  payload.
- **The globe speaks French to a French reader and English to everyone else.**
  The interface used to be half and half: a French product with an English
  shell inherited from God's Eye View (`DATA LAYERS`, `POWER UP`). Now the
  page picks its language before the first paint — a stored choice, then
  `?lang=`, then the browser's — and an FR/EN switch in the top bar changes it
  and reloads on the spot, camera, layers and panels restored from the share
  hash. French stays the default and its wording is unchanged, to the byte.
  Translated so far: the whole static shell and the panels, the layer registry
  (60 names, 7 groups, their sources and the ACTIF/CHARGEMENT/ÉTEINT statuses),
  the HUD and the loading screen, the first-visit card, the Address X-ray and
  the building cards, real estate (sales, energy ratings, valuation, the
  national scale), and every transport and mobility layer. Planning, crime and
  schools, health, risks and the voice follow. What the register publishes —
  a commune name, a DVF property type, a crime category — is data and stays as
  published; only its label is translated.
  A non-French reader is out of the first-run A/B test (variant A, no
  telemetry): the three cards were written and read in French, and measuring
  them against an English page would be noise.
- **The globe can speak English, one module at a time.** `/globe?lang=en`
  switches the page to English and remembers the choice (`?lang=fr` switches
  back); French stays the default and nothing changes for a French reader.
  The Gironde megafire layer is the first to answer in English — its play
  chip, its five frame chips (`Jul 24 09:05`), its clock (`day 4 of 10`,
  `last detection`) and its whole on-map key — while the rest of the globe is
  translated batch by batch in the next pull requests. The language is decided
  before the first paint, so an English page never flashes French.

### Fixed
- **On the Satellite basemap, the sea along the French coast flashed white
  every time the camera stopped.** Past the edge of its aerial survey, IGN
  answers with white tiles instead of no tile, and only at the finer zoom
  levels the globe loads once the camera rests — so the sea went white on
  every stop, in steps that followed the tiles, and came back when the camera
  moved. « Infrastructure numérique » sends every reader to that basemap, so
  the row showed it on every coastline. The white is now made transparent
  and the world satellite picture underneath shows through; the rest of the
  orthophoto is not touched.
- **In the clean view, clicking a sale, an energy rating or an antenna showed
  its name and nothing else.** The card went to the map key, which the clean
  view had just taken off the screen — it is hidden there, but a hidden panel
  still measures as one, so the globe kept only its tag. Clicked in the clean
  view, or with the key hidden after the click, an object shows its whole card
  on the globe again.
- **The Sentinel-2 satellite base painted the Americas, Asia, southern Africa
  and Australia as white land.** It used EOX's 2017 release, which covers
  Europe, North Africa and the Middle East only; it went unseen while it only
  stood in for a failed Esri. It is now the 2016 release — also CC BY 4.0, and
  the one that covers the whole world, at the same 10 m detail.
- **The dead-zone card no longer flickers, and the antennas layer stops
  working at rest.** A click on the ground showed a small « Chargement… » card
  and, a moment later, a taller one somewhere else, which read as the card
  vanishing and coming back; it now appears once, with its answer. An open
  card — on the ground or on a mast — no longer keeps the globe redrawing
  sixty times a second, and a pan no longer closes it. Panning no longer
  reshuffles the antenna dots either: from national to city scale, 99 to
  100 % of them stay put from one step of a pan to the next, against 18 to
  44 % before, and they still crowd where the masts crowd. A chip press no longer
  leaves the map without colour for a couple of frames: the next view appears
  in one go. The coverage tiles are now decoded off the main thread and kept
  in memory, so switching between the chips and Google 3D repaints without
  downloading again. Measured on a phone-class CPU, a chip press no longer
  stutters (48 → 58 frames a second); on Google 3D a flight over the Alps runs
  at 60 frames a second instead of 51.
- **Under a tilted camera the energy ratings, sales and other address layers
  answered for the blocks at the top of the screen, not the one in the
  middle.** They scanned around the point where the centre of the screen meets
  height zero, and a city stands higher: over Lyon's Presqu'île that point was
  328 m beyond the street being looked at, so the 200 m ratings disc missed the
  middle of the view entirely. They now scan around the street actually drawn
  under the centre of the screen; on the same view every rating badge falls in
  the middle half of the screen, against none before.
- **The shared-vehicles key took up to a minute to appear, then described the
  previous view.** The panel repainted on a toggle, on the 60 s poll or when
  the view changed territory, never when an answer landed: on the landing
  link the fleet was on the map at 15 s and its key at 61 s, and after a pan
  the key kept the old view's operators. Both layers of the row now repaint
  the key when their answer lands (0.8 ms a repaint, measured); the same view
  shows its key the moment its fleet is drawn.
- **With the landing link, not one Vélib' dock reached the photorealistic
  map.** The docks took their height from a raw `sampleHeight`, which read the
  depth the fleets' always-on-top dots write: all 1,518 docks stood 46 to
  48 km under Paris. They now use the floor the fleets use — the DEM, or a
  surface probe checked against a plausible band — and stand at street level
  (92 m median, where Paris is).
- **An oblique view said « Zoome pour charger » over streets full of
  scooters.** The layer refused any view wider than 3°, which a tilted camera
  is from 2 km up as soon as the horizon shows. It now asks for the ground
  around what the centre of the screen shows (six altitudes of it), so the
  same view 2.5 km over Seine-Saint-Denis draws its fleet.
- **The Paris shared-bike view showed a third of the bikes, no Vélib', and
  promised scooters that Paris banned.** The proxy capped each answer at 6,000
  objects taken in feed order across a margin that covers most of the city, so
  the landing page's view drew 737 of the 2,175 vehicles parked on screen. It
  now serves the screen first — all 2,175 there — and gives the margin at most
  a quarter of the budget; the same view weighs 624 KB and 3,673 objects
  instead of 1 MB and 6,000. A light device asks for 60 % of the budget and
  loses margin, not screen. When the screen itself holds more than the cap,
  the thinning is even and keeps the same bikes from one poll to the next.
  The landing link now switches Vélib' on with the shared fleets, and the
  gallery says *vélos et scooters*: the feeds publish no trottinette in Paris,
  where renting them has been banned since September 2023.
- **A sale's card now says how big the property is.** The surface was the
  seventh line of the card and the card shows six, so every sale that could be
  compared with its municipality — the ones a reader clicks for their price —
  lost it: a Biarritz flat read €1,250,000 and €16,026/m² with no way to see it
  was 78 m². It now rides on the type line, *Apartment + Outbuilding — 78 m²*,
  on the sale markers, on the parcels under them and on the parcels painted
  from altitude; a sale of several dwellings says the figure is their total.
- **Un lien vers Lyon ouvrait les ventes sur une carte vide.** Dans certaines
  orientations de la caméra, Cesium voyait bouger une caméra immobile : la
  lecture du cap déplace le vecteur « haut » d’un arrondi de l’ordre de
  10⁻¹⁵, assez pour dépasser sa tolérance une image sur trois. La fin de mouvement ne partait alors jamais, et les couches qui
  attendent qu’on s’arrête pour demander ce qu’il y a sous la caméra (ventes,
  parcelles, DPE, risques…) ne demandaient rien. Mesuré sur surplomb.app avec
  le lien « Une parcelle vendue à Lyon » : aucune requête en 40 s. Un écart
  inférieur à 10⁻¹² est désormais traité comme du bruit : ventes et parcelles
  arrivent à 5,6 s, et une caméra garée ne redessine plus la scène à chaque
  image.

### Changed
- **The globe fills the screen, and the place search sits at the top.** The
  black circle that framed the view — and blacked out both sides of a wide
  screen — is off by default; a light shade toward the corners replaces it,
  and « Assombrissement des bords » sets how light. The circle is still under
  Apparence › Réglages avancés › Lunette. On a computer, « Rechercher une
  adresse, une ville, un lieu… » is a field at the top centre (⌘ K, Ctrl K or
  « / »), with the places you searched before and the city shortcuts under
  it; Biarritz joins the cities.
- **One « Apparence » button for the look of the map.** The STYLE ACTIF chip,
  the STYLES VISUELS tray of the dock and the AFFICHAGE panel are now one
  panel at the top right: the styles as small previews of what you are
  looking at, the chosen style's settings under them, the basemap, the edge
  shade, « Mesures techniques » (the HUD) and « Vue épurée », then everything
  else under « Réglages avancés ». The round buttons of the top centre are the
  « … » menu beside it, with their names written out.
- **The technical readouts are off until you ask for them.** NORMAL /
  SUMMARY, ALT / SUN, AIS, the UTC clock and the vertical text on the left
  edge no longer show on a first visit; « Mesures techniques » or H brings
  them back, and CRT, NVG and FLIR still bring them with their look. The
  heading strip at the top shows with them.
- **The CAMÉRAS panel appears only with the cameras layer.** France has few
  public cameras, and the panel used to sit in the right column of every visit.
- **The camera panel speaks plainly, and the camera key moved into it.** The
  map legend no longer carries a « Caméras publiques » block (« Direction
  relevée 287 · Cône plein — l’orientation vient du champ direction… »): the
  panel says it in one sentence (« Chaque cône montre ce que filme une
  caméra ; en pointillé, sa direction est inconnue. »), shows the camera's
  name above the picture, and replaces the heading/FOV/range/CAL line with who
  publishes the picture and whether its direction is known. The badge reads
  « EN DIRECT », « ACCÉLÉRÉ », « STREET VIEW · PAS D’IMAGE PUBLIQUE » or
  « IMAGE · INDISPONIBLE » instead of « SNAPSHOT · OK ». The calibration form,
  the CAL chip and the English scene summary are hidden: calibration moves
  the drawn cone, in this browser only, never the camera, and it read as if
  a visitor could steer it.
- **The Layers panel is a column of groups with one list beside it.** On a
  computer, the panel now opens as a narrow column — « Chercher », then Ciel &
  mer, Bâti, Mobilité, Énergie, Risques and Réseaux, each with an icon and a
  badge counting the layers switched on in it — and the layers of ONE group in
  a list beside it, under the group's name, a search field, a pin and a close
  button. The search looks through every group at once, accents or not.
  Touching the globe — a click, a drag, the wheel — folds the list back into
  the column, and resting the mouse on the column brings it back on the same
  group; moving the mouse away folds nothing. The pin keeps the list open. On
  a short window the column keeps its icons and drops its words. Open, the panel is 380 px wide instead of 320. The phone keeps its
  list of groups.
- **The digital-infrastructure row is controlled from the map key.** Its
  block in the key now opens with one tile per member — Câbles (where the
  site offers it), Data centers, Antennes — each with its icon and a switch, lit in the colour that layer
  draws on the map; the row in the Layers panel keeps its own toggle and no
  longer carries eight chips. The 4G coverage has its own block under the
  antennas, « Couverture 4G », with two choices, « Sans 4G » and « Par
  opérateur » (then Orange, SFR, Bouygues or Free). Where no operator has 4G — or, per operator,
  where it has none — the ground is now hatched, on the map and in the key,
  so the dead zones no longer depend on telling two shades of pink apart.
- **The 4G coverage has its own switch, and the dead zones can be read with no
  antenna on them.** « Infrastructure numérique » now shows four tiles in the
  key: Câbles, Data centers, Antennes and Couverture 4G. The coverage is lit
  and put out on its own; with Antennes off, the map shows the dead zones
  alone. « Sans 4G » and « Par opérateur » now only choose what it paints.
  Shared links keep the choice, and links sent before keep their antennas.
- **The submarine cables have a key and a card for each landing point.** The
  key names the published route and the landing point in the colours the map
  draws them, and says the routes are TeleGeography's schematic lines, not a
  survey. Clicking a landing point — Lannion, Marseille — opens its card in the
  key: the place, its country, and « Voir les N câbles associés » listing the
  cables whose route reaches it. Every route is drawn in one cyan, and each
  line of a cable now answers a click as that cable (two thirds of them did
  not answer at all).
- **A clicked antenna or dead-zone spot opens its card in the map key.** The
  globe keeps a small tag over the object — the town, or « Point sélectionné »
  — and the full card sits beside the key it is read against. An antenna
  shows its town, what it stands on and whose it is, one plate per network on
  the air (2G to 5G), the wave measurement, how much of the land around can
  see it (« 28 % · rayon 39 km », never called coverage), the register's date,
  and a folded list of what each operator runs on it. A spot on the coverage
  shows who has signal there and a table of the four operators, each with its
  level in words and as phone bars. On a phone, or with the key folded, the
  whole card stays on the globe. Compound town names are no longer printed
  « Saint-sever ».
- **The hosted site no longer uses Google News RSS, Google Street View or the
  TeleGeography cable map; a clone keeps all three.** Google News allows
  personal, non-commercial use only, the cable map is CC BY-NC-SA, and
  Google's EEA terms forbid Street View imagery beside a non-Google map. With
  `GEV_NONCOMMERCIAL_SOURCES=off`: the cockpit's Regional News comes from
  GDELT alone and says so (« GDELT · REQUÊTE PAR LIEU · RÉCENT »); a CCTV
  camera whose frame fails shows « IMAGE · INDISPONIBLE » instead of a Street
  View still; the Câbles switch leaves « Infrastructure numérique », voice's
  "infrastructure mode" no longer asks for it, and a share link naming it
  explains that the site does not offer it. The server no longer hands out the
  cable files: they left the build's `assets/` and come through
  `/api/submarine-cables/`, which refuses them there. The three credits leave
  the Data attribution popover.
- **The CCTV frame route no longer fetches Street View at coordinates the
  request supplies.** Any `?lat=&lon=` used to buy a Google still of that
  point on the server's key; the fallback now looks only where the server
  holds the camera (its catalog, or an OSM camera it served), everywhere.
- **GDELT headlines are paced at one request every 6.25 s**, under the one
  every 5 s it enforces with a 429, now that it is the hosted site's only
  headline source.
- **The satellite beyond France no longer comes from Esri's anonymous
  endpoint on a commercial deployment.** Esri says of
  `services.arcgisonline.com` that “this service is not available for
  commercial use”. It is now the second source `GEV_NONCOMMERCIAL_SOURCES=off`
  turns off: the page never asks it there, not even before `/api/trial` has
  answered, and the world under the Satellite stack becomes Sentinel-2
  cloudless (10 m: cities and coastlines, not buildings). A build with
  `ARCGIS_API_KEY` draws the same Esri World Imagery through ArcGIS Location
  Platform instead, licensed and billed per tile (2 million free a month, then
  $0.15 per 1,000; no subscription), with “Powered by Esri” on screen while it
  is drawn. The key is inlined at build time like the Google browser key;
  `docs/DEPLOY.md` says how to create and restrict it. A clone without a key
  and without the switch is unchanged. The “Data attribution” popover now
  names only the world bases this page can draw, and
  `npm run qa:world-imagery-licence` checks the network log in a browser.
- **Flight routes, airline names and aircraft type names now come from the
  server's own copy of the VRS standing data, and adsbdb is gone.** The route
  line under a followed flight (« CDG → BUD · 812 km »), the SHOW ROUTE arc,
  the cockpit's FROM/TO panel, an airport card's « N en approche », the voice's
  route and airline answers and the « Air France · Airbus A320neo » line were
  fed by api.adsbdb.com, whose route data may not be copied into another
  database; the server kept a copy for every visitor. It now downloads Virtual
  Radar Server's standing data (CC0) once a day and answers from memory, so no
  request per flight leaves it. Over France, 84 % of airline flights find their
  route and 80 % pass the check against the aircraft's position (measured on
  756 flights, 2026-09-22), about what adsbdb gave; a flight number flown over
  several legs now shows the leg the aircraft is on. What a clone loses: on
  OpenSky's feed, which names no aircraft type, only the 28 % of aircraft the
  standing data knows get their silhouette at once — the rest keep the
  placeholder until adsb.lol names them. The Data attribution popover credits
  the standing data.
- **The hosted site no longer uses OpenSky: its flights come from adsb.lol,
  and over France from four circles instead of one.** OpenSky's terms require a
  written licence for any use by a company. With `GEV_NONCOMMERCIAL_SOURCES=off`
  (set on surplomb.app) the server never calls OpenSky — no snapshot, no
  history for a followed flight, no token — and the OpenSky credit leaves the
  Data attribution popover. A view over France gets four 250 NM adsb.lol
  circles merged into one map of France and its borders: 1 033 aircraft inside
  France's box on 2026-09-22 at 14:51 UTC, against 1 090 on OpenSky's snapshot
  and 605 in a single Paris-centred circle. Nearly all of them now carry their
  type and tail (97 %), so silhouettes are right at once; aircraft parked or
  taxiing at the Paris airports are missing, because adsb.lol's receivers do
  not see the aprons. A view elsewhere in the world gets one circle around it.
  The Flights row says « France métropolitaine et ses abords » or the circle's
  radius, and names adsb.lol, whose credit no longer calls it a fallback. A
  clone is unchanged: OpenSky stays its primary source.
- **Every request to adsb.lol now waits its turn, 20 s apart.** adsb.lol
  refuses a burst from one address after the second or third request and
  accepts one every 20 s. The civil circles, the four French ones and the
  military list now share one queue on the server, which only runs while
  somebody is looking and shares each answer with every visitor. Each French
  circle is refreshed every 80 s (100 s with the military list), and the
  military list every 20 to 100 s instead of 12.
- **A commercial deployment can switch off the sources licensed for
  non-commercial use only, and Open-Meteo is the first.** Open-Meteo's free
  API terms say “You may only use the free API services for non-commercial
  purposes”; the hosted site is run by a company. With
  `GEV_NONCOMMERCIAL_SOURCES=off` in its environment, the server stops asking
  Open-Meteo, and the cockpit shows no weather: no WX toggle, no cloud pass,
  and a Local Info page that holds the place and the position under “PLACE /
  POSITION” — no empty boxes, no Open-Meteo credit. The “Data attribution”
  popover drops the Open-Meteo line too. Unset, nothing changes: a clone keeps
  the weather. `/healthz` and `/api/trial` report the sources that are off in
  `sourcesOff`.
- **The hosted server now keeps every visitor, together, under the public
  APIs' published rate limits.** Every visitor reaches Géorisques, the IGN
  Géoplateforme (isochrone, WFS, geocoder and API Adresse), INSEE Melodi,
  Nominatim and the FOSSGIS routing servers from the server's one address, so
  their "per IP" ceilings apply to the whole audience at once: three people
  scanning addresses could cross Géorisques' one report a second. Each of
  these services now has one queue that spaces calls at 80 % of its published
  ceiling (the risk report one every 1.25 s, the isochrone 4 a second, the
  WFS 24, the geocoders 40, Melodi 16, Nominatim and the routing servers one
  every 1.25 s). A call waits at most 5 s and one visitor may hold at most
  half of a queue. Beyond that the layer is told to come back — « Cette source
  est très sollicitée en ce moment — réessaie dans 3 s » (“This source is in
  heavy demand right now — try again in 3 s”) — instead of the server
  hammering the service; a card missing only its queued part is shown and
  asked again on the next scan rather than kept, the search box answers from
  the IGN geocoder when Nominatim's queue is full, and a drawn route keeps its
  straight lines. If a service still answers “too many requests”, its queue
  stops for as long as it asks.
- **Live traffic stays inside TomTom's free allowance.** TomTom's free tier
  is 200,000 flow tiles a month, not the ~50,000 a day the daily cap was set
  against; the default cap drops from 40,000 to 6,451 tiles a day, so even a
  31-day month stays inside it (`TOMTOM_DAILY_TILE_BUDGET` still overrides
  it). When the day's tiles are spent the layer behaves as before: cached
  tiles keep their colours with their age, and otherwise the dots go back to
  simulated speeds with “TomTom daily budget reached” until midnight UTC.
- **Per-unit generation asks RTE once an hour.** RTE publishes the figures
  hourly and asks callers to call once an hour; the proxy held them five
  minutes and could ask 288 times a day. It now keeps them 60 minutes.
- **Doctors' names come from this week's directory, and a doctor can ask to
  be left out.** The names on the *Médecins (FR)* cards were a copy of the
  CNAM's Annuaire santé Ameli frozen in the repository at the 2026-08-17
  edition; they are no longer in the repository at all. The hosted site
  rebuilds them from the official source every Monday, so a correction made at
  Ameli reaches the map within a week, and a name on the site's removal list
  disappears from the next card anyone opens. A copy of Surplomb that has not
  built the names still draws every practice, count and accessibility figure;
  its cards say « Noms des praticiens indisponibles sur ce serveur »
  (“Practitioners' names are not available on this server”). A card opened
  just as the weekly rebuild lands asks to be reopened instead of guessing.
  The one practice whose address line was its doctor's nameplate now shows the
  town instead.
- **The 4G coverage and dead zones show on Google 3D too.** They were drawn on
  Satellite, IGN map and OSM only, and the key told a Google 3D reader to
  switch basemap. The same colours are now laid over Google's 3D mesh, at the
  same strength as on the flat maps, and a click on the mesh opens the « who
  has signal here » card standing on the ground rather than at sea level. On
  buildings inside a painted area the colour runs up the walls; the painted
  areas are almost never built up. The mast's line of sight is still drawn on
  the flat maps only.
- **In English, the voice trial no longer calls itself premium.** The mic's
  help line reads “Hosted demo · 3 free spoken requests”, and the card that
  closes the trial says “Voice is capped on this hosted demo” under a
  “SURPLOMB · HOSTED” kicker: the limit is this server's, and no tier is for
  sale yet. The French is unchanged.
- **Energy ratings paint the parcels from altitude, on the A–G scale, not
  discs.** Between 600 m and 1,800 m the layer now draws every parcel that
  holds a rating, coloured by the most frequent class of its ratings (a tie
  goes to the worse) — the rule its building follows closer in. Above 1,800 m
  it paints the cadastral sections the same way. The discs coloured by their
  share of F and G are gone; that share stays in the key, beside the
  national register's 9.75 %. The register names no parcel, so each rating is
  placed on the parcel its address point stands on, or on the one whose
  frontage it touches within 3 m: over Lyon's Presqu'île, 22,567 ratings land
  on 2,469 parcels and 157 on none, 99 kB gzipped. Only the part of the view on
  screen is sent to the browser — one or two squares of about a kilometre from
  low down, four at most — while the server loads the squares around it in the
  background, so moving a kilometre answers in tens of milliseconds instead of
  one to two seconds; each square is kept a week. From higher up the ADEME
  counts the ratings itself in 50 m squares (227,114 over central
  Lyon in four requests, 402 sections); a section is coloured only when three
  ratings fall in squares wholly inside it, which keeps a square or a quay with
  no dwelling uncoloured. A click on a parcel or a section opens its card in
  the key — its address, its ratings, the classes present — and the key's
  seven letters filter the map at every altitude.
- **Shared vehicles answer at every scale.** Above 250 km the layer shows one
  label per city with a network — its name over a bar of its operators'
  colours, 81 cities over France — and pressing one flies there; between the
  street and 250 km the fleets are counted in bubbles, which the proxy now
  groups up to cells of ~28 km. No « zoom in » card is raised any more; a
  camera aimed at the sky is told to aim at the ground. The Vélib' bikes stay
  in the bubbles up to the same height, and the other networks' docks join
  them too instead of being drawn underneath.
- **The shared-vehicle marks follow the ChatGPT « Repères discrets » mock.**
  The operator colours are the mock's own six, sampled from its pixels —
  Dott blue, Lime green, YEGO yellow, Voi coral, Vélib' cyan — and eleven
  more set at the same lightness, in place of seventeen full-strength hues. A
  vehicle is a 10 px dot inside a near-black ring, which keeps its edge on the
  photorealistic roofs where the 8 px dot got lost. A dock is a dark disc
  ringed in its operator's colour, holding a core as large as it is full — no
  more translucent tint — and the key prints its three levels once per row.
- **The map key is printed large enough to read.** A clicked sale's card in
  the key set its notes at 9 px and the class rows at 10.5 px, small enough
  that the operator squinted at the figures. Every line of the key grows: a
  class row is now 13 px, the smallest sentence 11.5 px, and the sale's card
  reads 16 px for the address, 32 px for the price and 18 px for the €/m².
  The price classes now stack one per line. A key that no longer fits its
  share of the right rail scrolls, and a newly clicked card is kept in view
  while the rail settles: at 1440 × 900 it used to be cut off under the price.
- **The flights key says what an aircraft is in plain words.** Two rows read
  as aviation jargon, each under a two-line explanation: « Plage OACI
  militaire » is now « Avion militaire » (*Military aircraft*), and « À
  l'estime (sondages manqués) » is now « Signal perdu, position estimée »
  (*Signal lost, estimated position*), on the civil and the military flights
  layers alike. Neither row carries an explanation any more.
- **The Vélib' bikes are in the bubbles too.** From the city-wide view the
  docks stayed dots under the fleet bubbles — 1,344 violet rings over Paris
  from 18 km, the densest mark on the map — and a bubble's number left out
  the bikes waiting in the docks around it. While the bubbles are drawn, each
  dock's available bikes now join the bubble of its grid cell, with a violet
  segment in its bar, and the dock itself is not drawn: over central Paris
  from 7 km, 114 bubbles count 24,417 vehicles, 10,255 of them in docks.
  Pressing « Vélib' » in the key keeps only the docked bikes, « Lime » only
  Lime's. Zoomed back in, the docks are dots again.
- **From the city-wide view the shared fleets are bubbles that count.** Above
  3.5 km over a view holding at least 1,500 vehicles, the globe no longer
  draws thousands of dots — or rather the 6,000 the server could send, which
  over Paris from 7 km left Lime, Voi and Dott all at « 987 ». The server now
  counts every vehicle it holds on a fixed grid, and each group is a bubble
  with its count and a bar of its operators' colours: 87 bubbles for 14,110
  vehicles over central Paris, in a 21 KB answer where the dots took 1 MB. The
  key's counts are those true numbers, the family filter and the operator
  focus re-count the bubbles without a request, and pressing a bubble zooms in
  until it splits — into smaller bubbles, then into dots and pins. A city with
  fewer vehicles keeps its dots, and so does the landing page's Paris view.
- **A clicked property sale opens its card in the key, not over the map, and
  its plot lights up.** The DVF card used to open nine lines tall on the
  sale's marker — over the block the reader was looking at. On a desktop with
  the key open, the card now sits under the price key: the address, the kind
  of sale and its date spelled out (« Vente · 31 mai 2024 »), the price large,
  what was bought, and the €/m² beside a swatch in the marker's colour, with
  its class and its ratio to the commune median, the cadastral parcel and a
  link to the register. The globe keeps a one-line tag with the address. The
  plot the sale bought is painted again in its class colour, strongly enough
  to light the building standing on it on the photoreal mesh, walls included;
  above 600 m the clicked plot or section lights the same way. A click on a
  washed plot's edge now opens the sale the wash is painted from. The × in the
  key, Escape or a click elsewhere closes it. With the key folded away, in the
  clean view, or on a phone (where the selection has its own tab), the card on
  the globe stays whole.
- **The two cheapest price classes are green.** The bottom class of the DVF
  ramp was a turquoise nobody read as « cheap »; it is now a deep green
  (`#0f8f55`) under the existing light green (`#7ed957`), kept apart by
  lightness (ΔE76 42 between the two).
- **« Une parcelle vendue à Lyon, et son prix » opens with the sales alone.**
  The landing-page link (and the example that shares its view) also switched
  the cadastral parcels on, which redrew the boundaries the sales layer
  already washes. The gallery image is unchanged until the next capture.
- **Shared vehicles are dots, and a few of them wear a pin.** Over the landing
  page's Paris view the globe drew 2,175 parked vehicles as 20 px plates, a
  carpet that covered the street it stood on. Every vehicle is now a dot of
  8 px in its operator's colour, and close to the street (below 3.5 km) a
  handful of them — never two within 200 px on screen — carry a pin that
  shows what the vehicle is: 24 pins on a desktop, 5 on a phone, none from
  higher up, where the dots say it all. Pins keep clear of the phone's search
  bar, its chips, its bottom sheet and the side panels, stay on the same
  vehicles from one poll or short pan to the next, and a selected vehicle
  always gets one, in cyan. Docks are now filled with their own operator's
  colour as far as they are full: a solid disc when well stocked, a tint at
  half, an empty ring when nearly empty — the green-orange-red fill put three
  greens side by side over Paris (Lime's vehicles, the Vélib' ring, a « bien
  remplie » dock). Vélib' moves from green to violet for the same reason.
  The operator's initial no longer appears on the map.
- **The shared-bike key became « Mobilités partagées »: a family control,
  operators by name, and one press that focuses the whole row.** The key over
  Paris used to print the same population twice (`VAE 5.2K · Scooter 797`,
  then `Lime 1.7K · Voi 1.7K`) under captions a rider does not use (« forme =
  quoi », « couleur + lettre = qui ») and a note apologising for it. It now
  opens on a segmented control — Tous · Vélos · Trottinettes · Scooters ·
  Voitures, with a segment only for a family on screen, so Paris offers no
  trottinette — then lists the operators as a dot in their map colour and
  their name. Pressing an operator shows only that operator, and the press is
  offered to the other layer of the row: « Lime » also takes the Vélib' docks
  off the map, « Vélib' » keeps only them, and pressing again brings
  everything back. Nothing is refetched — the filters hide what is already
  loaded, which is what a phone can afford on every press. The Vélib' docks
  get a block of their own in the same key, with what a dock's fill means.
  Counts are the objects on screen, not the prefetch margin; a car-share dock
  (Clem', `renault-zoe`) is now filed under « Voitures » instead of
  « Vélos »; the row's sub-titles say « Vélos en station » and « Flottes
  partagées » instead of « Stations GBFS » and « Longue traîne FR ».
- **The power grid and the power stations are one row, and switching it on
  turns the map to night.** « Réseau électrique » and « Centrales électriques »
  were two rows for the question the landing page's scene asks as one. The row
  is now *Réseau électrique et centrales* (*Power grid and plants*): its switch
  lights the grid and the stations' live output, as the scene link does, and
  moves the visual preset to Night; switching it off puts a night map back to
  Normal, also after arriving from the landing page's link. A preset picked
  while the row is on (CRT, FLIR…) stays. A share link or a restored session
  never moves the preset. Four chips take the row apart —
  *Réseau*, *Production*, *Registre EDF*, *Centrales hydro* — and the EDF and
  hydro registers now wait for their chip: on this row they drew the same
  stations a second time, a second icon on every nuclear site the relief
  column already names. Asking the voice for « centrales électriques » reaches
  the row.
- **The Noir preset is called Night (« Nuit » on the French page).** « Noir »
  was a French word on an English page, printed from the preset's internal id.
  The button, the ACTIVE STYLE corner, the HUD and the cockpit's vision control
  now say *Nuit* or *Night*; share links write `style=night`, and links that
  say `style=noir` — the landing page's among them — still open at night.
- **Road traffic keeps its colour for trouble, and says its cars are
  simulated.** Free-flowing roads are now a pale mint instead of a
  traffic-light green, on this layer and on the Bison Futé network status that
  shares its row; amber and coral are what stands out. Dots on streets TomTom
  does not measure are light grey instead of pure white, which made the one
  mark carrying no information the brightest on the map. The key reads
  best-first (Fluide, Ralenti, Bloqué, Non mesuré, Route fermée), drops the dot
  counts, says each cut in plain words (« de 55 à 85 % de sa vitesse sans
  trafic »), and opens on « Véhicules simulés, animés d'après les vitesses
  reçues de TomTom à 12:53 » — a time read off the tiles, with the day added
  when it is not today, where it used to promise a 60-second refresh that
  never happened.
- **The green frames and `VEH-…` numbers over the traffic cars are off by
  default.** They sat on every simulated car and claimed a tracked identity
  none of them has. The new « CADRES » chip on the Trafic routier row brings
  them back for whoever wants to watch the simulation work, and still switches
  detection on if it was off.
- **Airport noise zones read as contours, and each is named on its own
  line.** The four nested zones of a noise exposure plan used to be washed
  at 22 to 42 % opacity, which tinted the whole airport — Roissy's zone D alone
  is a 65.8 km ring — and hid the photograph. Only the zone the layer retains
  now keeps a visible wash; the others are a faint tint, and their outline does
  the work. Each zone's letter (or PGS figure) sits in a small framed badge ON
  its outline, as near the airport as the other badges allow: Roissy's zone D
  letter used to land 24 km away, off any frame that shows the airport. A badge
  opens the same card as its zone.
- **The airport-noise key speaks to anyone.** « PEB zone A 14 » and « PGS
  zone 1 3 » became two plain headings — *What can be built* and *Help to
  soundproof a home* — with each zone named by how loud it is (*Very loud* to
  *Quieter*) and, for building, what that means for a new home. Each swatch
  is the zone's letter or figure, as on the map's badges; the official plan
  names are one hover away on the headings, and the unexplained counts are
  gone.
- **Noir is now a night atlas: the ground goes dark, the data keeps its
  colour.** It used to desaturate the whole frame, which turned every colour
  ramp on the map grey and made the key print that it no longer decoded the
  map. The darkening moved into the scene, onto the basemap alone — the
  imagery layers of the active stack and the photorealistic tiles — and the
  pass that remains adds a bloom around bright pixels and a vignette. Its
  sliders are Darkness, Desaturation, Bloom and Vignette; a share link from
  before keeps its vignette and restores the rest at their defaults. Traffic
  keeps its colours under Noir, and the key stays valid.
- **The power grid wears a night dress under Noir.** Ivory 400 kV and orange
  225 kV that glow, steel-blue 150 kV and slate 63/90 kV that recede, each on a
  halo of its own colour instead of a dark casing that shadowed a dark ground.
  The daylight palette is unchanged everywhere else.
- **The keys of the power grid and of the power stations speak plainly.** One
  line per voltage band in words (*Très haute tension*, *Lignes régionales*)
  with one short sentence each, no counts, and a note that only says what a
  reader could misread — dashes are underground lines — and where the lines
  come from. The stations' key says how to read a station (*Hauteur de la
  colonne = production en ce moment*) and lists only the filières on screen,
  each with what it makes now against what it could; a filière drawing from
  the grid is said to consume rather than to produce a negative. Over the
  scene's view the key went from 14 rows, most of them paragraphs, to 10 rows
  of one sentence each. The grid's key was still inherited English on the
  French page; it is French now. The stations' layer is renamed
  *Production des centrales* (*Power station output*): « groupes de
  production » is RTE's word.
- **Property prices paint the parcels from altitude, not discs.** Between
  600 m and 1,800 m the layer now draws every parcel sold in the view,
  coloured by its latest sale against its own municipality's median — the same
  colour that parcel wears under its markers closer in. Above 1,800 m it paints
  the cadastral sections instead, each by the median of its sales, and leaves a
  section with fewer than three priced sales uncoloured. The 150 m and 850 m
  discs are gone: they fell across blocks and boulevards and named no ground a
  reader could see. Measured over Paris 16e: 1,207 parcels for 3,964 sales,
  70 kB gzipped, built in 4 ms on the main thread and on screen within 0.3 s;
  491 sections for the view from 5 km. A click on a parcel or a section opens
  its card.
- **“Value a property” starts unticked.** Switching on property prices no
  longer switches on the valuation of a 60 m² flat nobody described; its chip
  on the row turns it on.
- **L’écran de chargement s’anime aux couleurs de Surplomb.** Sur le vert de
  la marque, le soleil du logo quitte sa place et fait sa course au-dessus de
  la terrasse ; la terrasse jette son ombre sur le sol, plus longue quand le
  soleil est bas. La souris le prend en main (le doigt, tant qu’il glisse),
  comme l’œil de God’s Eye View suivait le curseur ; immobile trois secondes,
  il reprend sa course. Quand le globe est prêt, il se repose dans le logo,
  à l’aplomb de la terrasse, et l’ombre disparaît : « aucun angle mort ». Avec
  « réduire les animations », le logo reste fixe. Animation écrite par ChatGPT
  sur notre brief.
- **Sur téléphone, le haut de l’écran ressemble à Google Maps.** La recherche
  est une barre en haut, à côté du logo : on tape dedans, les villes et les
  repères s’ouvrent dessous, et la carte revient dès qu’on lance une recherche.
  Sous la barre, une rangée de puces allume ou éteint une couche d’un geste
  (Vols, Trafic, Transports, Vélos, Recharge, Météo, Écoles, Prix immo) ; une
  couche allumée depuis la liste complète y apparaît en tête pour s’éteindre
  aussi vite, et la dernière puce ouvre toute la liste. Le fond de carte a son
  propre bouton rond, à droite, qui ouvre un panneau à vignettes (Satellite,
  Plan IGN et OSM en tête) : il ne repousse plus les couches sous la ligne de
  flottaison de l’onglet Couches, qui commence désormais par les couches. Les
  boutons ronds s’effacent quand le panneau du bas est ouvert.

### Fixed
- **Sur téléphone, la carte était floue, quel que soit le fond.** Satellite
  IGN comme Plan IGN : un pixel d’image couvrait 6 à 12 pixels d’un iPhone.
  Deux réglages s’additionnaient. Le globe s’arrêtait à des tuiles trois fois
  trop grossières (tolérance d’erreur 3, celle du profil léger) et il se
  dessinait à la résolution CSS, que l’écran étirait ensuite ×3. Le téléphone
  s’arrête maintenant à une tolérance de 1 et dessine à 2× : la tuile tombe à
  un pixel d’image par pixel d’écran, comme Google Maps. Les pastilles, les
  traits et les étiquettes gardent leur taille. Le prix : une vue au repos
  demande environ deux fois plus d’octets d’imagerie (mesuré à 1 200 m sur
  Montparnasse : 1,1 → 2,2 Mo) ; pendant un glissé ou un pincement, le coût ne
  change pas.

### Changed
- **Les six vues de la page d’accueil et la réponse vocale étaient des images
  fixes.** Ce sont maintenant des boucles de 6 s enregistrées depuis
  l’application, interface du cockpit comprise : les voitures en détection à
  Paris, les bus de Bordeaux (accélérés ×5, avec la fiche d’une ligne), un
  avion en approche à Roissy, la fiche d’une vente et son prix à Lyon, les
  lignes et les centrales de la vallée du Rhône, les vélos et trottinettes de
  Paris (une petite orbite là où rien ne bouge seul). Une vignette pèse 26 à
  300 Ko en AV1 selon l’écran (650 Ko au plus en H.264 de repli, 930 Ko au
  plus en 1 440 px) et ne se télécharge qu’à l’approche ; hors écran, onglet masqué ou « Image fixe » cochée, elle
  s’arrête ; mouvement réduit, économie de données, 2G ou échec : l’image
  fixe, qui est désormais la première trame de la boucle. Les liens des vues
  01, 02 et 04 (et des exemples qui les ouvrent) cadrent ce qu’ils promettent :
  Roissy et son approche, une vente sous 600 m, le réseau sous 120 km.
- **La boucle de fond de la page d’accueil répétait une image sur six** (un
  à-coup à 25 i/s) : l’assemblage réglait les trames sur la cadence par défaut
  du démultiplexeur. Réassemblée depuis les mêmes trames, sans nouvelle
  session ; les fichiers servis sont jusqu’à 10 % plus légers et un peu plus
  nets.
  L’image de tête du README est une boucle GIF du même enregistrement.
- **Le réseau électrique mettait longtemps à s’afficher, et rien du tout
  au-dessus de 120 km.** Chaque tracé venait d’une requête Overpass en direct :
  4 à 21 s pour une vue jamais demandée, et aucune vue nationale possible (la
  même requête sur toute la France prend 4 min). La couche embarque désormais
  un **réseau national** pré-construit, comme le réseau gaz : les 89 000 km de
  lignes à 50 kV et plus cartographiées en France et 4 400 postes, simplifiés
  à 50 m près, dans un fichier statique de 570 Ko compressé. Il s’affiche à
  toute altitude, selon la hauteur de vue : le 400 et le 225 kV depuis
  l’espace, le maillage 63/90 kV sous 600 km. Sous 120 km, le tracé exact, les
  postes nommés et les pylônes se chargent comme avant et **remplacent sur
  place** les lignes nationales qu’ils couvrent, sans jamais tracer une ligne
  deux fois. Le reste du pays reste affiché autour. Si Overpass ne répond pas,
  le réseau national reste à l’écran au lieu d’une couche en erreur.
  Reconstruction : `npm run power-grid:national`.
- **Le globe portait encore l’identité de God’s Eye View.** L’œil cyan qui
  suivait le curseur, le mot en capitales espacées, les panneaux bleu nuit,
  la police machine à écrire et un bandeau « TOP SECRET » : tout venait du
  projet d’origine. Le globe (`/globe`) prend l’identité « Belvédère » de la
  page d’accueil : le symbole à deux plans et son soleil abricot devant
  « surplomb », sur la barre de titre et l’écran de chargement ; des panneaux
  vert nuit, un texte ivoire, un seul accent abricot ; DM Sans partout, avec
  des chiffres alignés. Le HUD ne montre plus que ce qu’il mesure : le
  bandeau de classification, le point « REC » et les identifiants de mission
  inventés sont retirés. La carte de partage (`og.png`), les pages légales et
  la radiographie d’adresse passent aux mêmes couleurs. Les cartes dessinées
  sur le globe gardent leurs couleurs de données (civil, militaire, trafic).
- **L’agent vocal se présentait encore sous l’ancien nom.** Il se croyait « GEV
  Voice Control » d’une application appelée « God’s Eye View », et l’aperçu
  d’une voix disait « Contrôle vocal GEV ». Il s’appelle désormais Surplomb :
  dans ses consignes, dans la description de ses outils, dans ce que le client
  lui envoie à chaque tour (le point de situation, la capture de la vue, les
  demandes de confirmation) et dans la phrase d’aperçu. Le résumé du HUD est
  demandé pour Surplomb. Deux textes montrés au lecteur suivent : l’avis de
  valeur est une « Estimation Surplomb », et le total de la délinquance est
  « calculé par Surplomb ». Les identifiants internes (`GEV_*`, `gev-*`,
  `X-GEV-*`, clés de stockage) ne changent pas, et le crédit à God’s Eye View
  reste dans les mentions légales et le README.

### Added
- **Les compteurs « En ce moment au-dessus de la France » restaient masqués
  faute de source.** Un point `/api/pulse` les compte à partir des caches que
  le serveur tient déjà — l’instantané OpenSky, le flux AISStream, les réseaux
  GTFS-RT, l’archive SYNOP — sans jamais interroger un amont : une visite de la
  page d’accueil ne dépense ni crédit OpenSky ni connexion AISStream. Chaque
  chiffre porte l’heure qu’il décrit ; absent, nul ou vieux de plus de 10 min,
  il vaut `null`, et la page ne montre que les chiffres valides (le groupe
  entier reste masqué si aucun ne l’est), puis retire chacun d’eux quand il
  dépasse les 10 min sous les yeux du lecteur. Les avions sont comptés au-dessus
  des terres françaises, les navires dans la mer territoriale (12 milles) :
  la boîte AISStream va de Porto à Anvers, et sans cette coupe le chiffre
  aurait été 2,6 fois trop grand. Les bus ne s’affichent que si tous les
  réseaux de l’index national ont répondu dans la fenêtre, et la météo attend
  une source plus fraîche que l’archive quotidienne : aujourd’hui, seuls les
  navires sont chauds en continu. Un seul appel, après le chargement et au
  repos ; un comptage par minute côté serveur, quel que soit le nombre de
  visiteurs.
- **La page d’accueil n’avait ni marque, ni fin.** Elle prend l’identité
  « Belvédère » : le symbole à deux plans et son point abricot, devant le mot
  « surplomb », dans l’en-tête et en clôture ; la même icône dans l’onglet, sur
  l’écran d’accueil iOS et dans l’application installée. La page finit
  désormais sur la ville, avec la marque et « Aucun angle mort. » en deux grands
  blocs. La boucle du fond reste derrière toute la page sur téléphone aussi, et
  une case « Image fixe » l’arrête sur l’image en cours. Sur ordinateur, le
  slogan de l’en-tête tient sur une ligne, derrière un filet.

### Fixed
- **Une fois le globe ouvert, la page d’accueil devenait inatteignable.** Le
  navigateur retenait « déjà venu » (`gev:vitrine-seen:v1`) et `surplomb.app`
  renvoyait au globe pour toujours, quelle que soit l’adresse tapée : la barre
  d’adresse disait `/` et montrait autre chose. Ce drapeau est retiré. `/` est
  la page d’accueil **à chaque fois, pour tout le monde** ; `/globe` reste
  l’adresse du globe, pour le favori, l’application installée ou la saisie
  directe. La porte ne lit plus rien du stockage — c’est une fonction de
  l’adresse seule — et la clé laissée par l’ancienne version est effacée au
  démarrage suivant.

### Added
- **La page d’accueil et le globe partagent une seule adresse.** Il y en a deux
  maintenant : `surplomb.app` pour la page d’accueil, `surplomb.app/globe` pour
  le globe. On peut taper, mettre en favori ou envoyer l’adresse du globe sans
  passer par la brochure, et la page d’accueil reste un vrai point d’arrivée.
  « Ouvrir le globe » fait basculer l’adresse **sur place** : l’image reste
  gelée, le moteur démarre dessous, rien ne se recharge et le lecteur ne voit
  aucune transition (`history.replaceState` réécrit un chemin, jamais un hôte —
  c’est pourquoi ce sont deux chemins d’une même origine et non un
  sous-domaine). Une application installée depuis le navigateur s’ouvre
  désormais sur le globe. Les liens de partage déjà envoyés (`surplomb.app/#…`)
  continuent de marcher tels quels.
- **Sur un écran Retina, le fond de la page d’accueil était pixelisé.** La
  boucle faisait 1 600 px à 1,4 Mbit/s et s’affichait agrandie près de deux
  fois. Elle est ré-enregistrée à la définition Retina (2880×1800 sur
  ordinateur, 960×2078 sur téléphone), tuiles photoréalistes plus fines, image
  par image, et chaque écran reçoit le fichier qui le couvre sans agrandissement
  et qu’il décode sans à-coup : AV1 d’abord, HEVC pour Safari sur M1/M2, H.264
  en dernier recours (`src/vitrine/renditions.js`). Un écran 1080p ne
  télécharge que la version 1920 (8 Mo) ; un Retina reçoit la 2880 (15 Mo).
  Posters en AVIF.
- **Un premier visiteur arrivait sur le cockpit sans un mot d’explication.**
  La racine sans `#` montre désormais une page d’accueil : « La France au
  rayon X. », une ligne d’exemples qui change toutes les trois secondes (et le
  montre : glissement, filet de progression, « 2 / 7 »), six vues à ouvrir, la
  voix, un champ « une adresse, une ville, ou ma position » et un seul bouton,
  « Ouvrir le globe ». Derrière la page tourne une boucle enregistrée depuis le
  globe (photoréel, voitures en mode détection, caméra qui pivote de 8°) :
  lire la page ne télécharge aucun moteur et n’ouvre aucune session Cesium ion.
  Sur ordinateur, « Ouvrir le globe » fige la boucle, démarre le globe dessous
  sur la même prise de vue, et l’image s’efface quand il a dessiné la même
  scène ; sur téléphone, le cockpit démarre normalement. Un lien de partage
  (`#…`), `?q=`, `?waitlist=1`, `?welcome=` et tout navigateur qui a déjà
  ouvert le globe vont droit au cockpit ; `?vitrine=1|0` force l’une ou
  l’autre porte. Le formulaire marche sans JavaScript (`/?q=Lyon`), et `q`
  quitte l’adresse dès sa lecture. Qui entre par la page d’accueil ne voit pas
  la carte de bienvenue. Sur ordinateur, le bouton replié se range dans la
  bande d’en-tête après 360 px au lieu de flotter sur le contenu. Scripts :
  `npm run landing:capture`, `npm run landing:assets`, `npm run qa:landing`.
- **L’éditeur du site butait sur « Essai terminé » comme n’importe quel
  visiteur.** Un pass propriétaire le sort de l’essai : `node
  scripts/owner-pass.mjs`, lancé là où vit `GEV_OWNER_PASS_SECRET`, imprime un
  lien valable dix minutes et une seule fois ; son bouton pose un cookie signé
  de 400 jours, valable pour le site et son nom en `www.`. Ce navigateur n’est
  plus jamais compté ni refusé, ne voit plus la couronne, et ses sessions
  vocales n’ont plus de limite de demandes ; les plafonds globaux par minute
  restent. L’adresse IP ne pouvait pas servir : le tailnet et le tunnel
  arrivent tous deux au conteneur sous la même adresse. Changer le secret
  révoque tous les pass. **Éteint par défaut** : sans la variable, la route
  répond 404.
- **Les trois cartes de bienvenue n’avaient jamais été montrées à de vrais
  visiteurs : rien ne disait laquelle aide à commencer.** Sur l’instance
  hébergée, chaque navigateur tire au sort la carte A, B ou C, à parts égales,
  et garde son tirage treize mois au plus. Il envoie au plus deux rapports par
  visite : quelle carte, ce qui en a été fait et quand (adresse trouvée ou non,
  tuile, fermeture et sa cause), puis si le visiteur a ensuite allumé une
  couche, lancé une recherche ou ouvert la liste d’attente, et la durée de la
  visite. Jamais le texte tapé (seulement sa longueur, par tranches), ni une
  position, ni les couches allumées, ni l’adresse IP, ni le navigateur : le
  serveur recopie chaque rapport champ par champ, jette le reste, et garde un
  fichier par jour pendant quatre-vingt-dix jours.

  **Le visiteur peut refuser.** Le bouton « Ne pas être mesuré » de
  `/confidentialite`, ou le signal Global Privacy Control du navigateur : la
  carte A s’affiche, rien ne part, et le tirage est effacé. La page de
  confidentialité ne décrit le test que lorsqu’il tourne.

  **Éteint par défaut.** Tout tient à `GEV_FIRST_RUN_AB=A,B,C` : sans cette
  variable, un clone montre A et ne mesure personne, et la retirer arrête le
  test dans chaque navigateur dès sa visite suivante. `node
  scripts/first-run-ab-report.mjs <dossier>` imprime les totaux par variante,
  leurs intervalles de confiance, la comparaison à A et l’échantillon qui
  manque, et dit si la règle d’arrêt permet déjà de conclure : une seule
  lecture, à 200 impressions par variante ou après 21 jours. La page ne lit
  toujours `/api/trial` qu’une fois : la couronne du micro et la carte
  partagent la même réponse.
- **La version hébergée a un essai et une liste d'attente, et rien ne les
  comptait.** Chaque navigateur a cinq essais du confort payant (un résumé HUD
  = un essai ; les lieux proches et la recherche Google s'arrêtent avec lui),
  comptés dans un cookie signé plutôt que par adresse IP, qu'un bureau ou un
  opérateur mobile partage entre des centaines de visiteurs. Au-delà, la carte
  « Essai terminé » s'ouvre sur le globe — jamais une redirection, qui perdrait
  la vue et le lien de partage — avec le formulaire Buttondown dedans et une
  question sur l'usage. Pas de prix sur la carte : il viendra sur la page de
  paiement.
  `?waitlist=1` ouvre la carte sans détour. Tout est éteint tant que
  `GEV_TRIAL_LIMIT` n'est pas posé : un clone sur ses propres clés n'a aucune
  liste d'attente.
- **La voix n'avait pas d'essai : le micro ouvrait la carte liste d'attente
  sans qu'on ait jamais entendu l'agent.** Un navigateur peut maintenant lui
  faire trois demandes vocales, une seule fois : l'essai de la voix compte pour
  un des cinq essais et ne se renouvelle pas. Après la troisième réponse, le
  micro se coupe, la réponse finit de se lire, la session se ferme et la carte
  dit « La voix est une fonction premium ». Le micro porte une couronne dorée
  là où la voix est vendue, et son aide dit ce que l'essai contient. La
  permission du micro est demandée avant d'ouvrir la session : un refus ne
  coûte plus l'essai.
- **Le site était ouvert sans mentions légales ni page sur les données
  personnelles.** `/mentions-legales` nomme l'éditeur, le directeur de la
  publication et les hébergeurs ; `/confidentialite` dit ce que la carte montre,
  ce qu'elle ne montre pas, et ce que le site sait du visiteur, flux par flux.
  Les deux liens ferment la ligne de crédits du globe, sur une ligne à eux.

  **L'identité n'est pas dans le dépôt.** Elle vient des variables
  `GEV_LEGAL_*` de l'instance, lues à chaque requête : un fork ne republie pas
  l'éditeur d'un autre, et une adresse postale n'entre pas dans un historique
  public. Sans elles, les pages affichent « non renseigné » et `/healthz`
  répond `"legal": false`.

  **Deux comportements du serveur ont changé pour que la page dise vrai.** Le
  journal de débogage de la voix n'écrit plus rien sur une instance hébergée
  (`GEV_REALTIME_DEBUG_LOG=1` pour le rallumer) : il acceptait de n'importe
  qui, sans plafond de débit, 8 Mo par requête, la transcription des réponses
  de l'assistant. Et le résumé de la vue demande à OpenAI de ne garder aucun
  état (`store: false`), au lieu de 30 jours par défaut. Enfin, `/api/*` porte
  `X-Robots-Tag: noindex` : les ventes DVF ne doivent pas être indexées.

  **La carte des permis n'affiche plus le nom d'un particulier.** Paris et
  Nantes Métropole publient chaque demandeur, particuliers compris ; seul le
  nom d'une entreprise ou d'une administration passe désormais, comme dans
  Sitadel. Un nom sans forme juridique ni mot d'organisation est masqué : le
  doute masque. Les éditions de permis en cache disque sont invalidées.

  **Sur un téléphone, le pied du panneau dépassait de l'écran.** La hauteur
  repliée était mesurée avant que Cesium ne remplisse les crédits : 116 px pour
  147 px de contenu, « Data attribution » coupé en deux. Elle suit maintenant la
  taille du pied.

### Fixed
- **Quand le navigateur refusait les polices, les boutons ronds affichaient
  « my_locatpublic ».** Firefox Focus, réglage « Bloquer les polices web »,
  sur iPhone : la police des icônes n'arrivait pas, et chaque icône écrivait
  son nom en toutes lettres, qui débordait de son bouton. La page le détecte
  maintenant et met un symbole du système à la place de chaque icône (⌖, 🌐,
  ✕, ‹…) ; si la police arrive en retard, les vraies icônes reviennent.
  `npm run qa:webfonts` le vérifie avec toutes les polices bloquées.
- **Sur téléphone, le globe s'ouvrait incliné à -30°, et un pincement zoomait à
  peine.** Le haut d'un écran portrait n'était que de l'horizon, avec les noms
  de rue écrasés, et rien ne permettait de redresser la vue : le tangage à deux
  doigts est délié exprès. Un téléphone arrive maintenant à la verticale, nord
  en haut, comme une application de cartes : au démarrage (au-dessus de la tour
  Eiffel et non plus un kilomètre au nord-ouest), sur « Autour de moi » (600 m
  au lieu de 1 200 m, la hauteur du démarrage), sur un lieu, une recherche, un
  feu ou un navire cliqué. Un lien partagé garde l'angle de son auteur. Le
  pincement est trois fois plus rapide : écarter les doigts de 150 à 300 px
  rapproche la caméra 1,84 fois au lieu de 1,23 (mesuré,
  `npm run qa:phone-top-down`), et un lancer du doigt glisse 0,27 s au lieu de
  0,13 s. Ordinateur et tablette ne changent pas.
- **Le HUD vidait l'essai avant que le visiteur touche au micro.** Il demande
  un résumé à chaque nouvelle vue, et chaque résumé coûte un essai : environ
  75 s d'exploration épuisaient les cinq, et le micro ouvrait « Essai terminé »
  sur une voix jamais essayée. Tant que l'essai de la voix n'a pas commencé, le
  HUD ne peut plus prendre le dernier essai : le serveur le refuse
  (`quota: "reserved"`), le HUD revient à sa ligne locale, et aucune carte ne
  s'ouvre. Les recherches de lieux Google restent permises pendant l'essai
  vocal, qui prend souvent ce dernier essai et a besoin des noms de lieux. Et
  une fois la carte vue, le HUD ne la rouvre plus par-dessus.
- **Le trajet tracé par la voix s'étiquetait en anglais : « 1.2 km · 12 min
  walk ».** Il affiche maintenant « 1,2 km · 12 min à pied » (à vélo, en
  voiture), et « à vol d'oiseau, sans itinéraire » quand le calcul d'itinéraire
  a échoué.

### Changed
- **La carte de premier lancement était le lanceur de l’amont, mot pour mot :
  en anglais, avec trois tuiles sur quatre hors de France.** LIVE CONTACTS,
  SPACE MISSIONS et ENVIRONMENTAL envoyaient le visiteur sur le globe entier,
  et la carte revenait à chaque session tant que la case « Don't show this
  again » restait décochée. Elle demande désormais une adresse (variante A, par
  défaut) : Entrée vole vers le lieu, et les ventes DVF, les permis et les DPE
  s’allument à l’arrivée. Deux autres variantes s’ouvrent à la main :
  `?welcome=b` (« Par où commencer ? », trois questions qui allument des
  couches sans bouger la caméra) et `?welcome=c` (pas de carte, une bulle sur
  le champ de recherche). La carte n’apparaît qu’une fois le vol d’arrivée
  posé, et une seule fois par navigateur : toute fermeture vaut pour les
  visites suivantes, et la case a disparu. `?welcome=1` la rejoue,
  `?welcome=0` la masque toujours.
- **`gev.enerlens.com` n'existe plus : `surplomb.app` est la seule adresse
  publique.** Les deux noms servaient le même conteneur, et l'ancien restait
  bridé par la règle Cloudflare de la zone `enerlens.com` (30 requêtes `/api`
  par 10 s, sans filtre d'hôte). L'enregistrement DNS, la ligne du tunnel et
  l'entrée de `GEV_PUBLIC_HOST` sont retirés. Les valeurs par défaut qui le
  visaient encore passent à `surplomb.app` : la sonde de la règle
  (`edge-ratelimit-probe.sh`), le référent de sonde de `set-google-key.sh` et
  les exemples des scripts et de la documentation. La règle, elle, reste : elle
  protège aussi l'API Enerlens. `docs/DEPLOY.md` décrit maintenant comment
  retirer un nom.
- **L'arrivée sur le globe 3D ressemblait à un rechargement de la page, et le
  tiroir des fonds annonçait « SATELLITE » pendant qu'on regardait le maillage
  de Google.** Trois défauts d'une même cause — l'adoption du photoréaliste
  parle au contrôleur directement, et rien en dehors d'un clic ne suivait.

  **La pastille et le lien de partage suivent maintenant le globe.** Le tiroir
  écoute `gev:map-stack-changed`, qu'il diffusait déjà pour les couches de
  données sans jamais s'y abonner lui-même ; et le hash cessait de mentir :
  un lien copié depuis le maillage disait `map=ign-ortho`, donc il ouvrait sur
  le satellite chez son destinataire — et chez son auteur au rechargement
  suivant, le hash périmé l'emportant sur la couche de démarrage.

  **L'achat part au premier geste, plus au premier repos de caméra.** Attendre
  l'immobilité voulait dire « une fois qu'il a lâché » : le lecteur traînait la
  vue, lâchait, et le fond qu'il regardait était alors jeté. La main est le même
  verdict deux à quatre secondes plus tôt, pendant que le mouvement couvre
  l'arrivée du maillage. Le repos reste la seconde porte, pour la main qui se
  pose depuis l'orbite — personne n'achète une ville pour regarder un continent.

  **Et la bascule ne laisse plus de trou.** Le maillage se charge *derrière* le
  fond que le lecteur a sous les yeux (`preloadWhenHidden`, sans quoi un tileset
  masqué ne demande rien), et les deux surfaces s'échangent en une image. Mesuré
  en navigateur : 18 tuiles en vol en permanence sous un tileset invisible,
  drainé à 2,7 s, plafonné à 2,5 s pour ne jamais retenir quelqu'un sur un fond
  qu'il a demandé à quitter.

  **La seconde visite ne construit qu'une seule carte.** Le verdict survit à
  l'onglet, donc un lecteur qui a déjà pris le maillage ouvre dessus au lieu de
  bâtir un fond pour le remplacer. Ça ne coûte pas une tuile racine de plus dans
  le cas normal — il l'aurait rachetée à son premier geste — mais un revenant
  qui ouvre et repart sans rien toucher la dépense désormais. Les premières
  visites et la flotte de harnais ne changent pas. Preuve :
  `npm run qa:photoreal-handover` (16 vérifications, 2 tuiles racines).
- **Treize familles d'équipements se distinguaient par la seule couleur, et
  quatre paires sur les quatre-vingt-onze étaient indiscernables.** Mesuré : la
  palette portait quatre paires sous ΔE 20 — `pharmacie`/`banque` à **15,9**,
  `restaurant`/`commerce` à 18,0, `boulangerie`/`sport` à 18,8,
  `courses`/`sport` à 19,0 — et ses quatorze teintes tenaient toutes entre
  L\* 32,8 et L\* 63,9. C'est la bande qui ne se détache ni d'une forêt, ni d'un
  champ, ni d'une toiture d'ardoise, c'est-à-dire de la France vue de 30 km.
  Un point de 5 px dans cette bande n'est pas peu lisible : il est introuvable.

  **Chaque famille porte maintenant sa silhouette**, découpée dans une pastille
  teintée — onze pictogrammes Maki (CC0) et un Material Symbols, aucun dessiné
  à la main, tous choisis sur une planche de contact rendue à 30 / 24 / 19 / 15
  / 12 px sur une vraie capture de l'application, multiplication Cesium
  simulée. Trois d'entre eux battent un candidat Material sur cette planche, et
  la raison est toujours la même : une silhouette garde ses contre-formes ou
  elle cesse d'être une silhouette. Trois pièces de bois restent trois masses à
  12 px là où l'éventail d'un croissant se referme.

  La palette a été refaite sur la même contrainte, en maximisant sa PIRE paire
  au lieu de sa moyenne : **ΔE minimal 39,3**, soit 2,5× l'ancien pire cas, et
  toutes les clartés à L\* 55,7 ou au-dessus. Le restaurant — 186 288 points,
  42 % de la couche — est la seule famille délibérément désaturée : à cette
  part, une couleur vive n'est pas une identité, c'est un lavis.

- **La légende est devenue la commande.** Chaque ligne de la clé est
  l'interrupteur de sa famille : on clique le pictogramme qu'on cherche, et la
  carte ne montre plus que celui-là. Treize pastilles auraient pris cinq lignes
  sur un panneau de 300 px pour redire ce que la clé disait déjà ; une puce
  « Tout » suffit à tout rallumer, et n'apparaît que quand elle sert.

  La sélection part dans la QUESTION et non sur la réponse, et ce n'est pas de
  la propreté. Mesuré sur le grand Paris : la boîte contient 46 422 points, la
  route `/sites` en rend 12 000 en commençant par les familles les plus rares,
  et **aucune** des 4 076 boulangeries ne survit à ce plafond. Demandées par
  `familles=boulangerie`, les 4 076 arrivent. Un filtre appliqué après le
  plafond aurait répondu « il n'y a pas de boulangerie à Paris ». Même règle un
  étage plus bas : le maillage alloue son budget par famille, donc une famille
  seule reçoit tout le budget de la vue.

  Le lien de partage porte la sélection, un caractère par famille.

- **L'hôpital a quitté « Équipements du quotidien » pour « Santé & secours ».**
  2 211 établissements FINESS, lus par `npm run medecins:registry` avec le même
  lecteur que le paquet des équipements. Un hôpital n'est pas une course du
  quotidien : qui en cherche un pose une question de santé, et les 64 232
  adresses de praticiens, l'indicateur d'accès de la DREES et les
  défibrillateurs sont déjà sur cette ligne-là.

  Le croisement qui a tranché, fait avant le déplacement : **50,3 % des
  hôpitaux ont une adresse de praticien libéral à moins de 50 m, à une distance
  MÉDIANE de 0 m** — la même coordonnée, parce qu'un consultant déclare
  l'hôpital où il consulte. Dessinés naïvement, c'étaient 1 113 pastilles
  posées exactement sur 1 113 autres. Le paquet compte donc les praticiens sur
  place à la fabrication, et une seule marque est dessinée : celle de
  l'établissement, avec le compte sur sa fiche.

  La croix change de main au passage. Une croix nue est le signe international
  d'un hôpital ; « Spécialité médicale » la portait et prend la trousse de
  Material, parce que deux croix sur une même ligne de panneau ne se séparent
  plus que par la teinte — exactement la panne que les pastilles suppriment.

  **La pharmacie reste où elle est** : on va à la pharmacie comme à la
  boulangerie. Le même croisement le dit — 27,1 % des officines ont un cabinet
  à moins de 50 m, contre 50,3 % des hôpitaux, soit l'écart entre une boutique
  de rue et un service d'un campus médical.

- **Le médecin généraliste de la BPE, lui, ne bouge pas — et le prix de son
  retrait est désormais chiffré.** La famille se retire déjà quand « Santé &
  secours » dessine des positions. Mesuré : **74,6 % des 30 213 points BPE ont
  une adresse conventionnée à moins de 50 m, 91,5 % à moins de 200 m**, à une
  distance médiane de 10 m quand ils s'apparient. Les deux registres décrivent
  bien une seule population ; les 8,5 % que la CNAM ne porte pas sont le prix
  annoncé de la règle « un registre par famille », pas un oubli.

### Changed
- **Le panneau Data Layers demandait 39 arbitrages avant de montrer la France,
  et le fork était le dernier des huit groupes.** Second tour de fusions :
  **39 lignes → 34**, huit groupes → six, et rien n'est supprimé.

  Trois sujets étaient dessinés par deux lignes. **« Urbanisme »** porte
  désormais la question dans ses deux temps — ce qui PEUT se construire (le
  zonage du GPU) et ce qui a ÉTÉ autorisé (Sitadel, au point et sur la
  parcelle) : lire un permis sans le zonage, c'est lire une réponse dont la
  question a été arrachée. **Les bouées** rejoignent « Navires et ports », dont
  les fiches lisaient déjà leur houle par `layerJoins.js`. **Le mégafeu de
  Gironde** devient le passé de « Feux actifs » — « what burns now / what
  burnt », comme le README l'écrivait déjà — en puce `optIn`, parce que 2,6 Mo
  de détections figées sur un département ne se paient pas depuis la Californie.

  **DÉFENSE et MARITIME ne tenaient plus qu'une ligne visible chacune** depuis
  les fusions précédentes : un en-tête majuscule, un triangle et un état plié
  pour dire ce que la ligne disait déjà. Les deux groupes sont fondus dans
  **CIEL & MER**, six lignes.

  **BÂTI & TERRITOIRE passe en deuxième position.** Il fermait le panneau comme
  « donnée de référence » — vrai de la DONNÉE, faux du LECTEUR : trois écrans
  de défilement, c'est là où un visiteur conclut que l'app n'a rien pour sa rue.
  Ce qui ouvre reste le direct ; ce qui suit immédiatement est la France.

- **Une ligne éteinte ne disait ni ce qu'elle contient, ni si elle dessinerait
  quelque chose.** Les puces n'existent que ligne allumée, donc une fusion était
  invisible jusqu'à ce que quelqu'un allume la ligne hôte par hasard. Elles ne
  sont pas devenues grises pour autant — un panneau qui peint 25 boutons ternes
  sur 33 lignes est un panneau que personne ne lit : **les noms des puces sont
  écrits en TEXTE** sur la ligne de méta qui existait déjà, trois puis « +N ».

  Et douze couches s'éteignent au-dessus d'une altitude ou d'une largeur de
  boîte — les dix qui partagent `createAddressScanLayer`, plus le cadastre
  (1 500 m) et le bâti 3D (0,08°). Chacune le dit très bien UNE FOIS ALLUMÉE
  (« Zoome sous 12 km ») ; aucune ne pouvait le dire avant, faute de module
  chargé. La ligne porte maintenant **« vue rapprochée »** pendant qu'elle est
  noire. Sans chiffre, délibérément : douze seuils différents sur douze lignes
  ne sont pas actionnables, et le seuil exact appartient à la couche, qui le
  donne au moment où il mord. Qui porte la facette est **croisé avec les
  modules** dans `layerTaxonomy.test.mjs`, jamais déclaré à la main tout seul.

- **Les cabinets de la couche Médecins étaient posés à un quart de kilomètre
  sous la rue qu'ils décrivent, et on n'en voyait que la moitié.** Deux pannes
  sur le même point, et chacune ressemble à autre chose.

  La première est une HAUTEUR. Chaque marqueur était ancré sur l'ellipsoïde ;
  au-dessus de la place Bellecour le sol dessiné est à 220–309 m ellipsoïdaux
  (168 m de Lyon plus 50 m de géoïde). Comme la couche peint sans test de
  profondeur, un marqueur enterré est peint quand même : sa position à l'écran
  devient une fonction de la pose de la caméra. Mesuré sur 193 marqueurs,
  caméra à 900 m inclinée à −40° : **171 px d'écart médian, 276 px au pire**,
  et le marqueur GLISSAIT sur les toits à chaque déplacement. Les marqueurs
  sont désormais assis sur le sol — cellule DEM partagée, sondage de la surface
  rendue en attendant — et **replacés** quand un meilleur sol arrive : un
  panoramique aller-retour de 300 m les laisse à **0,00 px** de leur pixel.

  La seconde est un PARASOL. Le test de profondeur était actif : une pastille
  porte UNE profondeur pour tout son carré, donc le sol plus bas à l'écran —
  plus PRÈS de la caméra — mangeait sa moitié inférieure. C'est le « à moitié à
  l'intérieur des bâtiments » du rapport. `disableDepthTestDistance` passe à
  l'infini, la valeur maison partout ailleurs dans ce dépôt.

- **Et un point coloré ne disait pas de quel médecin il s'agissait.** Six
  familles, six teintes, aucune étiquette : au-dessus de Lyon la couche peint
  544 marques, au-dessus de Paris 5 907, et un lecteur devait retenir six
  couples couleur-mot puis trouver le sien par élimination contre une légende à
  l'autre bout de l'écran.

  Chaque famille porte maintenant sa silhouette, découpée dans la pastille
  teintée : un **stéthoscope** pour la médecine générale, une **croix** pour le
  fourre-tout des 24 spécialités médicales, un **adulte et un enfant** pour
  femme et enfant, une **tête** pour la santé mentale, un **scalpel** pour la
  chirurgie, un **trèfle** pour l'imagerie et la biologie — dont 90,8 % des
  40 009 lignes sont radiologie, médecine nucléaire ou radiothérapie. Rien n'est
  dessiné à la main : Maki et Temaki (CC0) d'abord, Material Symbols pour les
  trois sujets qu'aucun jeu cartographique ne publie. La ligne de légende porte
  la même marque, masquée et teintée par `manager.js` — une famille, une ligne,
  deux canaux, jamais une seconde liste par forme.

  La pastille descend une rampe de distance : pleine taille sous 900 m (17 à
  30 px selon le nombre de médecins à l'adresse), 50 % à 30 km, et à 60 km elle
  revient au point de 6,5 px que la couche dessinait avant.

- **À Lyon, la couche Défibrillateurs recouvrait la ville de fiches dont une
  ligne sur six disait quelque chose.** Le jeu GeoDAE rend 1 176 appareils dans
  une vue de centre-ville. L'hôte d'annotations en matérialise au plus 160 par
  source : une fiche par appareil n'a donc jamais été possible, et ce qui
  arrivait à l'écran était **~25 fiches de sept lignes — un échantillon de 2 %
  du jeu, à pleine hauteur, par-dessus la carte qu'il décrivait**. Derrière,
  1 176 tiges de rappel de 65 px hachuraient Lyon en rose.

  Mesuré sur les 888 DAE de la commune : `Commune : Lyon` sur 888 lignes,
  `État : En fonctionnement` sur 883, `Accès : Intérieur` sur 885 — et deux
  lignes qui affichaient le littéral Postgres brut, `{lundi,mardi,mercredi,
  jeudi,vendredi}` et `{"non renseigné"}`.

  Désormais : **le nom seul flotte**, le détail complet arrive au clic (la fiche
  de contexte, qui a toujours porté la ligne entière et pas seulement les champs
  déclarés). La bascule est automatique et se lit — au-delà de 160 objets
  chargés, une fiche par objet est arithmétiquement impossible, donc la couche
  n'en promet plus une. La tige est plafonnée à 18 m dans ce régime : la marque
  reste dégagée du maillage photoréaliste, le mur de hachures disparaît.

  La fiche du clic est réécrite avec : les littéraux `{…}` sont décodés
  (`lun–ven`, `24h/24`), une ligne qui ne dirait que « non renseigné » n'est pas
  écrite, `Commune` part (c'est la vue), et `État` **n'apparaît que lorsqu'il
  n'est pas « En fonctionnement »** — les 5 cas sur 888 sont les seuls que
  personne ne doit manquer. Le cas courant passe de six lignes à deux.

- **Et la couleur de cette couche ne séparait rien.** Elle peignait
  `Intérieur` / `Extérieur` : 885 contre 3 dans Lyon. Elle peint maintenant ce
  qu'un lecteur vient réellement demander — *puis-je m'en servir maintenant* :
  **accessible 24 h/24** (41), **accès libre** (584), **accès restreint** (304),
  chacun avec son effectif dans la légende. Trois puces sur la ligne filtrent
  sur ces mêmes groupes ; elles **masquent des marques et ne déchargent rien** —
  l'effectif de la couche et la légende continuent de compter le jeu entier.

  Rien de tout cela n'est du code propre aux défibrillateurs : un manifeste
  déclare désormais `feature.ambient`, `feature.blank`, `format` / `omitWhen`
  sur une ligne de détail, des groupes de couleur **par règles ordonnées sur
  plusieurs colonnes**, et `feature.filters`. Voir `docs/DATASETS.md`.

- **Les pastilles des autorisations d'urbanisme flottaient au milieu de nulle
  part, et elles glissaient sur les toits dès qu'on faisait pivoter la carte.**
  Mesuré au-dessus de Paris, caméra à 500 m : **les 4 753 pastilles de la couche
  étaient à 1,0 m d'altitude ellipsoïdale**, c'est-à-dire 76 à 97 m sous le sol
  que la carte dessinait à cet endroit — et elles n'avaient pas bougé d'un
  centimètre quinze secondes plus tard.

  Une pastille enterrée est peinte quand même : cette couche désactive le test
  de profondeur pour qu'un marqueur ne soit pas avalé par le trottoir sur lequel
  il se tient. Sa position à l'écran devient alors une fonction de la POSE DE LA
  CAMÉRA. C'est ce que le lecteur voyait : des points rattachés à aucune
  parcelle, qui se déplacent quand la carte tourne.

  La couche lisait le modèle de terrain, qui répond sur le réseau. Elle posait
  ses pastilles avant la réponse, prenait `0` pour l'absence de réponse — soit
  l'ellipsoïde, 44 à 55 m sous la France métropolitaine — et ne réécrivait
  jamais ces positions. Elle avait pourtant une relance à trois secondes : elle
  ne reconstruisait que les volumes extrudés.

  Les quatre marques d'une autorisation — la pastille, le volume, la fiche et
  l'étiquette de repérage — lisent maintenant le même sol : le modèle de terrain
  quand il a répondu, une sonde du maillage réellement dessiné en attendant,
  jamais `0`. Et une passe à délai doublant replace ce qui est déjà à l'écran
  quand un meilleur sol arrive. Au-dessus de Lyon après correctif : **0 pastille
  sur 1 779 à l'ellipsoïde**, 197 à 438 m, le relief lyonnais.

  Le harnais qui le prouve refuse le proxy d'altitude, parce qu'un harnais qui
  le laisse répondre passe sur le code cassé — vérifié, mêmes chiffres au
  dixième sur les deux versions. Sans lui : 9 pastilles sur 9 à 1,0 m, 71,9 m
  d'écart médian au sol et jusqu'à 166 px de glissement ; avec le correctif,
  1,3 m et 21 px (`npm run qa:sitadel-floor`).

  **Et un sol mesuré n'est pas forcément un sol.** Toujours au-dessus de
  Nantes, le maillage se déclarant chargé : **81 sondes sur une grille d'1,3 km
  ont toutes répondu entre −424,9 m et −360,2 m**, en une rampe régulière à
  5 % — une tuile à l'échelle de la planète qui répond pour une ville. Ces
  valeurs passent la bande de plausibilité mondiale (−500 m, le rivage de la
  mer Morte), donc elles étaient retenues, et le rayon d'emprunt en prêtait une
  à toute la commune : 9 pastilles sur 9 à 200–430 m **sous** l'ellipsoïde,
  soit pire que le bug corrigé ci-dessus. Une couche qui ne répond que pour des
  communes françaises sait que son sol tient entre **−100 m et 5 000 m** (le
  rivage antillais sous un géoïde à −42 m, le mont Blanc sous un géoïde à
  +52 m). Hors de cette bande, la lecture est refusée, enregistrée comme telle,
  et **redemandée à chaque passe** au lieu d'être gravée : une surface qui a
  menti n'a pas le droit de le faire une fois pour toutes.
- **L'icône d'une installation classée mesurait 16 pixels, et la commune
  n'était qu'un trait.** Signalé sur la couche Risques (Géorisques) au-dessus
  de Bassussarry, à 5 859 m : « elle est beaucoup trop petite, quasiment
  invisible ». Mesure : **15,9 px à l'écran**, alors que la constante de la
  couche annonçait 24. Personne n'avait jamais mesuré la marque à l'altitude
  où on la lit, parce que la rampe cache le chiffre — Cesium interpole un
  `NearFarScalar` sur la distance **au carré** puis élève `t` à la puissance
  0,2, si bien que la valeur *lointaine* gouverne presque toute la plage. Sur
  l'ancienne rampe (400/1,0 → 9 000/0,6), `t^0,2` vaut déjà 0,38 à 900 m et
  0,84 à 5 859 m.

  La réparation est donc surtout à l'autre bout : la rampe va maintenant
  jusqu'au plafond de dormance de la couche et s'arrête à 0,8 au lieu de 0,6
  (400/1,0 → 12 000/0,8), et les trois tailles montent de 30/24/18 à
  **40/34/28**. Mesuré à 5 859 m : **34,0 px** pour un site Seveso, **28,9**
  pour une installation classée, **23,8** pour un site déclassé, contre 15,9
  avant. Repère : une installation militaire, dessinée par la couche voisine
  au-dessus du même maillage, fait 25 px à cette distance. Le prix est le
  chevauchement dans un quartier industriel dense vu du plafond — un lecteur
  qui a besoin d'une marque descend, ce que personne ne peut faire avec une
  marque qu'il ne trouve pas. « Lisible » n'est pas « trouvable » : les 10 px
  mesurés par le pack d'icônes portaient sur une marque déjà trouvée.

- **Et la commune est maintenant en surbrillance, comme les régions du mix
  électrique.** Le trait seul perdait son sujet dès que le regard le quittait :
  une ligne cyan qui traverse une colline est une ligne, et les onze verdicts
  affichés à côté portent sur le sol *à l'intérieur*. L'intérieur est donc
  teinté — un lavis du même cyan à 0,18 d'alpha, à plat, classé au sol comme le
  trait, découpé sur l'anneau de la commune. Composité sur la vue signalée
  elle-même : le pas à la limite communale se lit déjà à 0,16 et les verts de
  l'orthophoto blanchissent à partir de 0,24.

  **Une seule couleur, jamais graduée.** Géorisques ne publie aucun score
  composite et compter les aléas en inventerait un : douze « faible » ne valent
  pas un « important ». La légende dit ce que la teinte est et ce qu'elle n'est
  pas — « un périmètre administratif, pas l'étendue d'un risque, qu'aucun de
  ces aléas ne publie » — et la couche déclare enfin `surfaceFill`, ce qui monte
  la note partagée sur le drapé du lavis sur le maillage photoréaliste.

  **Un remplissage classé au sol est cliquable** — la couche Délinquance
  sélectionne une commune exactement comme ça — donc un lavis de cette taille
  aurait avalé le clic-sol de toutes les couches voisines à l'intérieur de la
  commune : demander « que dit le PLU ici ? » n'aurait plus rien répondu sur des
  kilomètres. Le lavis est déclaré **décoration** (nouveau
  `pickRegistry.registerPickDecoration`) : il ne porte ni nom, ni fiche, ni
  propriété, `isWorldPick` répond « la carte », et les clics passent au travers.
- **Une ligne, deux registres, et un seul interrupteur pour les deux.** La
  couche « Urbanisme (PLU & servitudes) » dessine deux réponses sur le même sol :
  un aplat de zonage qui couvre chaque mètre carré du bloc, et des emprises de
  servitude tiretées qui le traversent — une seule enveloppe `pm1` mesurée fait
  759 polygones sur des kilomètres. Au-dessus d'un centre-bourg les deux
  s'empilent, et pour regarder sous l'une il fallait éteindre la réponse
  entière.

  Chaque moitié prend sa **puce** sur la ligne : *Zonage PLU* et *Servitudes*,
  indépendantes — « le zonage seul », « les servitudes seules » et « les deux »
  sont trois questions qu'un lecteur se pose vraiment. Elles ne coûtent **aucune
  requête** : une seule interrogation rapporte les deux moitiés (1,4 Mo au pire
  cas mesuré), donc masquer l'une redessine depuis la réponse déjà en mémoire,
  sans créneau de rate-limit. Les puces commandent le **dessin** et rien
  d'autre : le repère de scan et toutes les fiches de sol gardent la réponse
  complète du registre, et la fiche du repère dit ce qui est masqué — sinon
  « 5 servitudes : … » au-dessus d'une photo vide se lit comme une couche
  cassée. Éteindre les deux est permis et laisse le repère : une ligne allumée
  ne dessine jamais rien.

- **Et la légende de cette couche n'a jamais rien affiché.** Arrivée le
  3 septembre, elle déclarait `rowControls(payload)` dans le commit même où la
  coquille partagée passait à `rowControls(runtime, summary, payload)` — les
  deux moitiés d'un rebase — donc le décompte des familles tournait sur l'objet
  des paramètres et chaque scan publiait une légende **vide**. Huit familles de
  zonage peintes au sol, huit teintes, et rien nulle part pour les décoder. La
  clé revient, et elle suit les puces : une pastille pour une forme que personne
  ne voit est le même défaut qu'une clé pour un scan en sommeil.

- **La seule panne que le lecteur pouvait réparer lui-même s'affichait deux
  secondes.** Quand une mise en ligne remplace le build sous un onglet resté
  ouvert, la première couche allumée demande un fichier que le serveur ne sert
  plus, et le navigateur retient cet échec pour toute la vie de l'onglet :
  recliquer ne peut pas marcher, recharger marche toujours. Le message le
  disait — « Bornes de recharge : code non chargé — recharge la page », 55
  caractères — et l'effaçait au bout de **2 000 ms**. Deux sessions ont été
  perdues dessus le 14/09, chacune en recliquant la même ligne.

  La consigne s'exécute maintenant toute seule. La bannière reste affichée,
  décompte **6 secondes** et recharge la page — avec la couche demandée
  rallumée, écrite dans l'adresse avant le départ, pour que le rechargement
  termine le clic au lieu de ramener le lecteur à l'état qu'il essayait de
  quitter. Un bouton **ANNULER** arrête le compte à rebours ; la bannière
  devient alors **RECHARGER** et tient **30 secondes**.

  Quatre situations retirent la recharge automatique, et laissent le bouton :
  un onglet qui a déjà rechargé dans les **10 dernières minutes** (sans quoi un
  fichier réellement absent ferait boucler l'onglet indéfiniment), un onglet en
  arrière-plan, un tour de voix en cours, et un navigateur qui refuse d'écrire
  son stockage de session — sans cette marque, il n'y a pas de garde-fou, donc
  pas d'automatisme. `npm run qa:stale-build` rejoue la panne en coupant le
  fichier d'une couche : 14 vérifications, dont le décompte visible, la couche
  rallumée après recharge, et l'onglet qui ne reboucle pas.

- **La couche Cours d'eau traçait des rivières vert foncé sur une France
  verte.** `#009245` est le vert que Vigicrues publie lui-même, et sur le maillage
  photoréaliste comme sur l'ortho IGN il tombe exactement dans la couleur de la
  végétation. Un trait de 3 px qu'il faut chercher ne vaut pas mieux que pas de
  trait, et aucune opacité ne sépare un vert sombre d'un coteau vert sombre.

  Les trois couleurs qui **avertissent** — jaune, orange, rouge — ne bougent pas
  d'un octet : ce sont elles qui portent le sens, et un test les épingle. Le
  niveau 1 est un autre objet. Il dit *« pas de vigilance particulière
  requise »*, c'est l'**absence** de signal, et hors épisode c'est la totalité du
  réseau (337 tronçons sur 337 dans l'instantané de référence). Ce que la carte
  dessine alors, c'est le réseau hydrographique surveillé de France — pas une
  alerte. Il est donc tracé **en cyan**, dans la famille de bleus du point de
  station Hub'Eau qui vit sur la même ligne du panneau.

  Le niveau reste dit en toutes lettres partout où un lecteur le rencontre : la
  légende affiche **SANS VIGILANCE** avec la phrase du service en infobulle, et
  `level` / `levelLabel` portent toujours `1` / `VERT` aux propriétés d'entité
  et au moteur d'analyse. Un tronçon que le flux élève quitte cette branche
  immédiatement et reprend la couleur de l'État.

- **La fiche d'une station de mesure dessinait une barre de progression pleine
  au-dessus d'un chiffre qui disait 48 %.** L'hydrogramme 24 h est tracé depuis
  ZÉRO : une rivière qui ne fait rien — la situation cinq jours sur six pour
  l'essentiel du réseau — rend 48 barres pleines. Deux dessins qui se
  contredisent valent moins qu'un seul qui dit quelque chose.

  Une fiche ne porte plus qu'**une** barre, et c'est la comparaison qui a une
  référence : le débit du jour contre la moyenne du même mois sur les
  trente dernières années publiées. 40 cellules, encrées à hauteur du pourcentage, le reste laissé
  en `░` — la part qui n'est pas là aujourd'hui. Au-dessus de la moyenne la barre
  se remplit et porte un `▸` plutôt que de changer d'échelle : 100 % doit rester
  le bord droit, sinon deux stations ne se comparent plus à l'œil. La ligne
  d'amplitude (« de 5,1 m³/s à 5,5 m³/s sur 24 h ») reste — c'est là qu'était
  vraiment l'information des 24 heures. Une station de hauteur d'eau, ou un débit
  sans série mensuelle exploitable, garde l'hydrogramme : c'est alors la seule
  barre disponible.

- **Et la fiche n'affiche plus « ⚠ influence locale ».**
  `influence_locale_station` est la note du producteur sur ce qui perturbe sa
  propre courbe de tarage — un seuil, une écluse, une marée. À l'écran, c'était
  un pictogramme d'avertissement et un mot sans référent, sur une station qui
  mesure normalement. Retiré de la fiche **et de la requête** : rien d'autre ne
  le consommait.

- **Neuf marqueurs sur dix de la couche Stations météo n'avaient rien à
  répondre, et l'un d'eux servait un relevé vieux de cinq jours.** Le réseau
  temps réel de Météo-France compte **2 144 stations** ; **190 publient leurs
  relevés en accès libre**. Les 1 954 autres mesurent en ce moment même et leurs
  valeurs sont derrière une clé API. La couche les dessinait toutes : un lecteur
  qui cliquait un point avait 91 % de chances de tomber sur une explication au
  lieu d'une mesure.

  La couche ne dessine plus que les **190**. Le fichier expédié garde les 2 144
  — 660 Ko contre 72 Ko, payés une seule fois, à l'allumage de la couche — parce
  que la porte est un booléen : `SHOW_ONLY_PUBLISHING`. Un déploiement qui
  obtient une clé Météo-France le bascule et retrouve le réseau entier sans
  reconstruire une seule donnée. `getStats()` annonce les **1 954 retenues** à
  chaque appel : cacher des stations est un choix d'affichage, prétendre que le
  réseau en compte 190 serait un mensonge sur la France.

  Les trois puces de filtre partent avec : sur les 190 stations dessinées,
  VENT en gardait 189, PRESSION 187 et RELEVÉS les 190. Une commande qui
  supprime un marqueur est une décoration.

- **Et le relevé « de la dernière heure » venait d'un miroir gelé depuis le 9
  septembre.** Le bucket S3 de Météo-France sert l'archive SYNOP sous deux
  préfixes, même produit et même nom de fichier. Mesuré le 14/09 :
  `data/OBS/SYNOP/synop_2026.csv.gz` écrit le matin même à 07:00Z,
  `data/synchro_ftp/OBS/SYNOP/synop_2026.csv.gz` intouché depuis cinq jours — et
  répondant 200 pendant tout ce temps. Le proxy lisait le second. Il lit
  maintenant le premier, et le script de construction aussi.

  La même mesure corrige ce que le produit racontait de lui-même : 382 344
  lignes pour 190 stations sur 251 jours, soit **8 relevés par station et par
  jour** — des observations tri-horaires consolidées une fois par jour vers
  07:00 UTC. Donc **le relevé le plus frais lisible sans clé a entre 11 et 35
  heures**, la fiche affiche l'heure de l'observation et jamais le mot
  « maintenant », et le cache du proxy passe d'une heure à six : rafraîchir
  23 Mo toutes les heures pour un fichier quotidien n'achetait rien.

  Ce que la clé achèterait — les 1 954 stations manquantes *et* l'heure qui
  vient de passer — est chiffré dans `docs/meteofrance-api-access.md`, réservé
  à la version hébergée : le dépôt open source démarre et dessine sans une
  seule clé.

- **Allumer les caméras publiques prenait une demi-minute pour refuser
  d'afficher plus de 14 vignettes, et l'essentiel de cette attente ne servait
  personne.** Mesuré sur Austin, catalogue de 815 caméras, serveur chaud, fond
  de carte `osm` : **8,1 s** avant que la couche rende la main, **33,5 s** de
  raffinement de géométrie derrière, **54 requêtes** vers le calculateur
  d'altitude, et une vignette peinte par seconde. La couche était complète vers
  **40 s**.

  Le raffinement visitait **les 815 caméras**, à 4 toutes les 120 ms. Il était
  borné par sa propre cadence, pas par son travail : 30,6 caméras par seconde
  contre un plafond théorique de 33,3. Et pour environ 800 d'entre elles, tout
  ce qu'il produisait était une correction d'altitude de quelques mètres sur une
  icône située sur un autre continent — les cônes de couverture n'existent que
  pour les 14 voisines de la caméra active, et l'anneau de vignettes plafonne à
  40. Il ne parcourt plus que **les caméras à l'écran**, plafonnées à 96, et
  `moveEnd` complète l'ensemble quand l'opérateur se déplace. Résultat :
  **4,7 s**.

  Deux garde-fous existaient uniquement parce que ce raffinement durait
  longtemps : l'anneau de vignettes se bridait à 16 cartes, et la rafale de
  premier remplissage (4 en parallèle) attendait la fin. Les deux tombent, et
  l'anneau affiche désormais son budget entier — **18 vignettes au lieu de 14**,
  toutes peintes en **8,7 s au lieu de ~40 s**.

  Le préchauffage des altitudes de sol se demandait caméra par caméra, au fil de
  la file. La garde de vol unique ne transmettait alors que les cellules
  accumulées pendant un aller-retour, si bien que le découpage en lots de 200
  points n'avait jamais rien à découper : mesuré à 30 ms d'aller-retour,
  815 points demandés un par un coûtent **408 requêtes**, la même liste demandée
  en une fois en coûte **5**. L'ensemble part maintenant en un appel :
  **54 → 11 requêtes** sur un vrai chargement.

  Côté serveur, `/api/cctv/sources` bloquait sur 7,6 Mo de catalogues amont
  (Caltrans en pèse 6 à lui seul) **à chaque démarrage** — 12,6 s mesurées. Le
  catalogue est désormais gardé sur disque et servi même périmé, le
  rafraîchissement tournant derrière : **0,06 s** après un redémarrage. Seul le
  tout premier démarrage paie encore l'amont.

  Enfin, une vignette de 192×108 px téléchargeait et décodait l'image amont
  entière (~190 Ko, ~1280×720) avant de la réduire. Elle est maintenant décodée
  à la taille demandée, et un démontage annule le téléchargement au lieu de
  laisser les octets arriver.

- **Les étiquettes DPE glissaient quand on bougeait la carte, et on ne voyait
  pas de quel bien elles parlaient.** Les deux venaient de la même cause, et ce
  n'était pas l'ancrage au sol.

  Un scan par défaut du 13e arrondissement sert **200 diagnostics portant 14
  coordonnées** — 13 adresses, 5 identifiants de bâtiment. Une seule coordonnée
  en portait **42**. Seule la vignette du dessus était visible et cliquable ;
  les 41 autres étaient un coût de dessin et une **loterie** au moment d'ouvrir
  la fiche, entre quarante-deux logements. Et le point dessiné était un
  géocodage BAN : un point sur la rue, pas un immeuble.

  C'est aussi ce qui faisait glisser les marques. L'assise sur le relief dessiné
  dispose de 24 sondes par passe sur six passes : **200 marques n'y tiennent
  pas**, des dizaines restaient à la hauteur de repli du centre de scan, et une
  marque à la mauvaise altitude sous une caméra qui n'est pas à la verticale se
  déplace à l'écran quand la caméra tourne. Mesuré dans l'application, 1400 ×
  900, nadir à 420 m, avant puis après :

  | | vignettes | erreur d'altitude | écart à l'écran | glissement sur un pan de 250 m |
  |---|---|---|---|---|
  | avant | 200 | 25,2 m | 25,5 px | **72,6 px** |
  | après | 10 | 0,0 m | 0,0 px | **0,0 px** |

  Les diagnostics sont désormais **regroupés par bâtiment** quand le registre en
  nomme un (`id_rnb`), par adresse BAN sinon. Une adresse dont toutes les lignes
  identifiées nomment le **même** bâtiment prête cet identifiant à celles qui
  n'en portent aucun — 111 lignes sur 200 en portent un, 135 après report. Une
  adresse qui en nomme **deux** n'en prête aucun : c'est le cas d'un bâtiment de
  cour derrière un bâtiment de rue, et le trancher au hasard serait un tirage au
  sort déguisé en enregistrement.

  Chaque groupe dessine trois choses au lieu de quarante-deux vignettes :
  **l'emprise du bâtiment**, lavée de sa propre lettre et cerclée — sur le fond
  photoréaliste la teinte monte le long des façades, donc la réponse à « où est
  le bien » est un immeuble entier allumé dans sa couleur, **sans avoir à
  allumer Bâti 3D** ; **la parcelle cadastrale**, en trait tireté achromatique
  et jamais en aplat (le canal de couleur appartient aux sept lettres, et un DPE
  ne dit rien du terrain) ; et **une vignette**, posée à l'intérieur de son
  propre contour.

  Un clic n'importe où sur le bâtiment, sur son contour ou sur sa parcelle ouvre
  **la même fiche** et relève la même vignette. Cette fiche répond pour
  l'immeuble : `36 DPE, de B à G, majorité C · 1 passoire (F ou G) · 578 €/an
  estimés (médiane du site) · emprise 800 m² au sol · parcelle 75113000CG0056 —
  899 m² cadastrés · bâtiment nommé par le diagnostic (id RNB) · 59 m du centre
  du scan`. La dernière ligne de provenance est **toujours** écrite, et elle
  distingue quatre situations : le registre nomme le bâtiment, le RNB l'a
  retrouvé **sous** le point BAN, le RNB a donné le **plus proche** (avec sa
  distance, annoncée comme une déduction), ou aucun bâtiment n'a pu être placé.
  La ligne de la couche compte ce qui est entouré : `10 adresses · 10 avec
  emprise bâtie`.

  Les emprises viennent du **RNB** et les parcelles d'**Api Carto**, résolues par
  le proxy `/api/dpe` et partagées avec le cache que la couche Cadastre
  remplissait déjà. Ni l'un ni l'autre ne peut retenir les diagnostics : si une
  des deux sources est muette, la vignette et la fiche restent, et la ligne dit
  combien d'adresses n'ont pas d'emprise.

  Retombée pour les autres couches : une sonde d'altitude est désormais payée
  **par coordonnée** et non par marque, donc des marques empilées ne peuvent plus
  épuiser le budget d'assise à elles seules.

- **La légende des îlots de fraîcheur tenait 18 lignes, et toute la couche
  glissait sur les toits dès qu'on bougeait la carte.** Deux défauts sans
  rapport l'un avec l'autre, sauf qu'ils se voient sur le même écran.

  **Les points n'étaient pas sur le sol.** Chaque objet était posé à la hauteur
  0 de l'ellipsoïde plus un mètre — sous Paris, 70 à 80 m sous la rue qu'il
  décrit. Le test de profondeur étant désactivé sur cette couche, un point
  enterré est peint quand même, et sa position à l'écran devient une fonction
  de la pose de la caméra : on déplace la carte, et les arbres, les fontaines et
  les refuges glissent sur les toits avant de sauter en place. Mesuré au-dessus
  des Tuileries, caméra inclinée à −35° à 900 m : les 14 pastilles dessinées
  passent de 1,0 m ellipsoïdal à **72,3–81,7 m**, zéro sur l'ellipsoïde, et le
  glissement sur un panoramique aller-retour de 300 m tombe à **0,0 px**.

  **Et la clé demandait 18 lignes pour quatre registres peints en même temps.**
  Sur une vue de Paris, les arbres seuls prennent jusqu'à 12 500 des ~14 300
  points — 95 % de l'encre et trois des lignes, pour le registre qui dit le
  moins par objet — et les 23 parcs qui déclarent une ouverture canicule, le
  constat pour lequel cette couche existe, étaient dessous. La canopée passe de
  six bandes plus un gris à **deux**, coupées à un quart du sol : six échelons
  d'une seule teinte tracés à alpha 0,34 sur une ville photoréaliste ne sont pas
  séparables les uns des autres. Les refuges passent de cinq mécanismes à
  **trois**, pliés sur la question posée — on entre (225), on se met dessous
  (156), il y a de l'eau (154). Et chaque registre gagne un bouton
  (`PARCS · REFUGES · FONTAINES · ARBRES`) : la clé n'imprime que ce qui
  dessine, soit **8 lignes** par défaut et 11 avec les arbres.

  **Les arbres sont éteints par défaut**, et le bouton coupe la requête et pas
  seulement la peinture : c'est le seul registre acheté par vue (1,7 Mo décodés
  sur la boîte centrale mesurée). Rien n'est perdu : les 66 espaces à exactement
  zéro de canopée sont nommés dans l'infobulle de la bande basse, le seul espace
  sans indice publié est reporté dans la note du bloc, et le `type` publié de
  chaque refuge reste verbatim sur sa fiche.

- **La couche des prix s'appelait « Immobilier (DVF) », ses deux puces de type
  ne filtraient rien, et son symbole € disparaissait dans les toits.** Trois
  défauts d'un même écran, relevés rue des Basques à Bayonne le 14/09/2026.

  **Le nom.** « Immobilier (DVF) » renseignait qui savait déjà ce qu'est le DVF
  et personne d'autre. La ligne s'appelle **« Prix de l'immobilier »**, et
  l'acronyme est resté là où va une source : sur la ligne juste en dessous, et
  dans la méthode de la clé. Les deux puces de la ligne sont devenues des
  verbes — **« Estimer un bien »**, **« Mes comparables »**.

  **Les puces mentaient.** « Appart. » et « Maison » appartenaient à
  l'ESTIMATION voisine : elles choisissaient le sujet d'un calcul et ne
  touchaient aucun point de la carte. Avec « Maison » allumée sur un
  centre-ville qui n'en compte aucune, le lecteur lisait **257 appartements
  comme des maisons** — le registre en compte zéro dans les 300 m. Le type est
  désormais un **vrai filtre** porté par la ligne (`Toutes · Appart. ·
  Maisons`), il retire les points de la carte, des volumes et du décompte, et
  le même clic règle l'estimation d'à côté : une intention, un contrôle, deux
  couches. Mesuré : **397 ventes → 1** sur « Maisons », et le médian de
  référence ne bouge pas d'un euro (règle C1). Le filtre ne coûte aucune
  requête — il porte sur les lignes déjà servies — et il voyage dans le lien de
  partage. Chaque fiche nomme enfin **ce que la vente a acheté**
  (`Appartement + Dépendance`, `Local industriel…`), ce qu'aucune ne faisait.

  **La clé faisait trois écrans.** Dix entrées, un paragraphe sous chacune :
  **828 px de contenu** avec l'estimation allumée, dans un rail qui n'en
  montrait que 216. La clé ne garde que ce qui est peint — les cinq classes et
  le gris « sans prix au m² », en **une barre de distribution** plutôt qu'en six
  lignes empilées — et les bornes sont en €/m², la seule unité comparable à une
  annonce. Ce qui n'était pas une classe a rejoint les deux emplacements qui
  existent pour ça : le dénominateur et la règle gelée au-dessus, l'écrêtage et
  les mutations sans coordonnée en une phrase en dessous, le reste en infobulle
  et sur la fiche. **Rien n'est supprimé, tout est compté. 828 px → 475 px.**

  **Le symbole € se fondait dans les toits.** Un € en trait blanc à 19 px pose
  environ **7 % de sa boîte en encre** ; 7 % d'ambre sur un champ de tuiles en
  photoréaliste, c'est rien. Le marqueur est devenu une **pastille pleine** :
  le disque prend la couleur de la classe — le canal gagne ~40× de surface — et
  le € est frappé dedans en sombre, avec un cerne qui le détache de n'importe
  quel toit.

  **Et le sol de la vente est teinté.** `id_parcelle` est publié sur chaque
  mutation et c'est la clé du cadastre ouvert d'Etalab : **400 jointures sur
  400** dans les 300 m à Bayonne. La parcelle vendue est donc lavée au sol,
  plaquée sur ce que le globe dessine vraiment (terrain ou tuiles 3D), à la
  couleur de sa mutation la plus récente. Un € qui flotte ne désigne aucun
  bâtiment ; une parcelle teintée, si.

  Garde-fou : `npm run qa:dvf-row` — 15 vérifications sur l'application vivante,
  du décompte des marqueurs à la hauteur de la clé.
- **La clé des bornes de recharge tenait 13 lignes et 301 mots, et le lecteur
  n'en voyait que la moitié.** Mesuré dans Chrome sur une vue de ville :
  **717 px de contenu dans une fenêtre de 355 px**, donc coupé, et sa dernière
  phrase jamais à l'écran. Le bloc portait, pour six classes de couleur : la
  règle de lecture du faisceau en quatre échelons **cotés en pixels** (« 64 px de haut »), deux en-têtes de
  canal d'un paragraphe chacun (la racine carrée, la correction de tangage et
  sa limite à 70°, la deutéranopie, les bornes de classe gelées), la provenance
  du registre avec sa date de dépôt, et une phrase finale sur les 127
  identifiants de station publiés à une même coordonnée.

  Tout cela est vrai, et rien de tout cela n'est ce que le lecteur est venu
  chercher : **il cherche où se brancher.** La clé ne répond donc plus qu'à une
  question — que veut dire la couleur — en **7 lignes, 46 mots et 215 px, dans
  une fenêtre de 262 px** : plus rien n'est coupé. Un en-tête « Vitesse de
  charge », les classes présentes dans la vue avec leur compte, et
  la classe refusée en anneau creux. S'y ajoute une seule ligne, et seulement
  quand elle est vraie : ce que le filtre de puissance masque, et pourquoi un
  site retenu compte quand même ses bornes lentes.

  **Rien n'est perdu, tout est à un clic.** La date de dépôt est sur la fiche du
  site, désormais **par site et en français** (`🗓 déclaré 15/11/2025 →
  30/07/2026`) — plus solide que le dernier dépôt de la vue, puisqu'un dixième
  de ce registre n'a pas bougé depuis 2023. L'éditeur est nommé dans la surface
  d'attribution. La règle du faisceau et son plafond sont sur cette même fiche,
  **à côté du nombre exact de points de charge qu'ils décodent**. La taille
  d'une cellule du maillage, en degrés et en kilomètres, est la première ligne
  de sa propre fiche.

  Et la classe des puissances illisibles s'appelle **« Puissance inconnue »** au
  lieu de « Puissance non exploitable » : le second décrivait ce que la valeur
  avait fait à notre analyseur, le premier dit au lecteur ce qu'il peut savoir
  de la station. La fiche nomme toujours la cause, et la marque garde sa forme
  propre.

- **La couche Risques disait tout et ne montrait rien.** Au-dessus du
  Trocadéro, à 555 m, elle dessinait **un** triangle au trait pour un
  établissement classé — « très peu visible, voire clairement invisible » — et
  **rien du tout** pour les huit aléas que le même scan avait déjà résolus.
  Inondation, argiles, sismicité, radon, canalisations, sols pollués étaient
  récupérés, projetés, résumés dans `getStats()`, et lus par aucune surface du
  globe : la seule à les afficher était `fiche.html`, qui n'a pas de lien
  depuis la carte. Qui allumait la couche voyait un écran vide sans moyen
  d'apprendre qu'il ne l'était pas.

  **La commune est maintenant tracée.** Un liseré, pas un aplat, et c'est un
  choix sur ce que la source dit : `resultats_rapport_risque` répond « Risque
  Existant » sur une commune et sur une adresse, sans aucune géométrie. Une
  commune remplie se lit « l'eau monte jusqu'ici », une limite se lit « la
  compétence est ici » — et c'est ce qu'un verdict communal est. Le contour
  vient de `geo.api.gouv.fr`, un appel par scan, **sur le code INSEE résolu par
  la BAN** : un scan parisien trace le 13ᵉ arrondissement, pas le 75056 que le
  rapport renvoie. Pas de rampe de sévérité non plus : Géorisques ne publie
  aucun indice composite, et compter les aléas n'en est pas un — douze
  « faible » ne valent pas un « important ».

  **Les verdicts sont dans la clé de la carte**, lisibles sans ouvrir un
  panneau qui s'affiche replié, avec une **case vide au lieu d'une pastille de
  couleur** — le créneau « constaté, non cartographié » du manager, qui existe
  exactement pour un fait que la carte n'a pas pu dessiner. Un aléa dont les
  deux verdicts divergent garde sa ligne et les imprime tous les deux : sur le
  13ᵉ, l'ICPE est « Risque Concerne » pour la commune et « Risque non Concerne »
  pour l'adresse, les argiles « Risque Existant - important » contre « Risque
  non Connu ».

  **La marque est une plaque pleine.** Le triangle au trait mettait son encre
  sur un filet de **1,09 pixel de large** à 15 px de rendu ; la plaque
  concentre la même encre en une masse continue cerclée de noir, avec le point
  d'exclamation évidé dedans — le traitement des sites militaires, pas celui
  des marqueurs d'adresse.
- **Quatre exploitants dans la même rue dessinaient la même tache.** La couche
  des véhicules partagés portait l'exploitant sur la COULEUR et la forme sur une
  silhouette Material teintée. Mesuré aux tailles réelles de la rampe : à 17 px
  le `pedal_bike` de Google referme ses propres contre-formes et met **86 px² de
  couleur sur 88 en un seul bloc contigu**. Le canal forme avait déjà disparu —
  restait « la même tache dans une autre teinte », pour Lime, Dott, Voi et Pony
  côte à côte.

  La marque est maintenant une **pastille** : un disque à la couleur de
  l'exploitant, cerclé de noir, avec la silhouette du véhicule **évidée dedans**.
  L'artwork passe de Material (un jeu d'INTERFACE dessiné pour 24 px dans un
  menu) à **Maki** (CC0, dessiné dans une boîte de 15 unités pour une étiquette
  posée sur de l'imagerie) : `bicycle`, `scooter`, `car`, plus `charging-station`
  comme badge électrique du VAE. La trottinette garde `electric_scooter` de
  Material — aucun jeu cartographique sous licence permissive n'en publie une,
  vérifié sur tout Maki et les 557 icônes de Temaki.

- **Et sous 1 218 m, chaque pastille porte l'initiale de son exploitant.** 84
  exploitants se partagent une palette de 17 teintes : la couleur seule ne peut
  pas fermer le canal « qui ». Le monogramme est le second canal, non coloré —
  la capitale d'Inter évidée dans un badge. Il s'allume exactement tant que la
  pastille est dessinée à sa taille pleine, et s'éteint au-delà plutôt que de
  laisser une lettre illisible. La clé le montre : chaque ligne d'exploitant
  porte désormais sa teinte ET sa lettre.

  **Les logos des exploitants ont été essayés d'abord, et mesurés.** Ils échouent
  sur trois comptes indépendants : aucun flux ne les publie (0 système sur les
  146 systèmes français joignables ne remplit `brand_assets`) ; les récupérer par
  le web donne la mauvaise marque en silence (Lime, Voi et Vélib' répondent 403,
  et le domaine de Cityscoot — faillite en 2024, toujours au catalogue — sert
  désormais les favicons d'un site sans rapport) ; et un logotype mot ne survit
  pas à la taille carte. Rendus à l'échelle, seules les marques qui sont DÉJÀ une

### Fixed
- **Un permis de 45 logements dessinait un bloc opaque de 404 000 m³ au-dessus
  d'un village.** La puce « Sur parcelle » des Autorisations d'urbanisme
  extrudait LA PARCELLE d'un mètre par logement autorisé. Un prisme est base ×
  hauteur : la masse lue à l'écran valait donc le compte de logements
  **multiplié par la taille du terrain**, que le registre ne mesure pas. Mesuré
  sur les parcelles réellement extrudées : base médiane 403 m² et maximum
  40 400 m² à Paris, 395 m² et 153 173 m² à Nantes — **388 fois la médiane** —,
  637 m² et 24 955 m² à Ustaritz. Deux permis d'un logement dessinaient des
  masses dans un rapport de 388, et la plus grosse marque de Nantes pesait
  25 426 754 m³ pour un seul dossier. Le cas signalé : `06454721B0037`, 45
  logements sur trois parcelles jointives (8 984 m²), un bloc de 404 000 m³
  au-dessus d'Ustaritz et de ses maisons de 8 m, pour un dossier dont la
  surface de plancher créée est de 3 308 m². La hauteur était en outre dessinée
  **une fois par parcelle**, donc un dossier à trois parcelles réclamait ses
  logements trois fois : 932 logements de prisme pour 499 autorisés à Ustaritz
  (×1,87), ×1,73 à Nantes, ×1,30 à Paris. Le canal hauteur passe sur une
  **colonne de 12 m de côté, une par dossier**, plantée sur l'ancre du permis —
  là où se tient déjà sa pastille, donc un sol pour les deux marques. La
  parcelle redevient ce qu'elle était : un aplat classé au sol, sa teinte est
  son état, sa bordure et sa fiche ne bougent pas. Le volume est de nouveau
  proportionnel au seul compte (volume total dessiné divisé par 20 à 28 selon
  la commune, plus grosse marque 28 800 m³), et la sélection cyan retourne au
  sol au lieu de devoir grimper sur le toit d'un bloc opaque.
- **Chaque fiche de parcelle en France créditait Bordeaux Métropole.** La
  phrase « emprise publiée par Bordeaux Métropole » était écrite en dur, du
  temps où le portail bordelais était la seule source d'un contour dans cette
  couche. La résolution cadastrale a ensuite donné une emprise à tout le pays —
  un dossier Sitadel nomme jusqu'à trois parcelles, et Etalab publie le
  cadastre — sans que le crédit ne bouge : une parcelle d'Ustaritz dessinée
  depuis le cadastre créditait une métropole à 200 km. La provenance est
  désormais lue sur les dossiers posés sur l'emprise : le portail est nommé là
  où il a livré la géométrie, « emprise cadastrale — la parcelle nommée par le
  dossier » là où cette couche l'a jointe, les deux quand un même contour sert
  les deux registres. La fiche du dossier, elle, se tait sur le cadastre : elle
  nomme déjà la parcelle au-dessus et la déduction en-dessous.
- **Un registre d'aléas muet ressemblait à une adresse sans risque.** Mesuré en
  direct le 2026-09-14 : `resultats_rapport_risque` a refusé toute connexion
  pendant une session entière pendant que `installations_classees` et `radon`
  répondaient normalement. La couche traçait une commune, 31 établissements, et
  du silence là où va le verdict inondation — impossible à distinguer d'une
  adresse que le registre aurait déclarée propre. La clé nomme désormais la
  panne, et les établissements restent affichés : une source indisponible
  dégrade un acte, pas la mission.
- **Un site sur trois était peint « Seveso » sans l'être.** `statutSeveso` n'est
  pas un booléen : c'est une étiquette, et l'une de ses valeurs est la chaîne
  `"Non Seveso"`, qui est *truthy*. Mesuré sur 380 établissements et quatre
  scans (Feyzin, Port-Jérôme, Lacq, Paris 13ᵉ) : 181 lus comme Seveso, dont
  **141 — 78 % — ne le sont pas**, dessinés dans la couleur la plus forte de la
  couche, à sa plus grande taille, à côté d'une fiche affichant « Seveso : Non
  Seveso ». Autour du Trocadéro seul, 24 sur 100.
- **La clé survivait au dessin qu'elle décrivait.** Une couche d'adresse qui
  franchit son plafond de 12 km vide la scène en une image, et son prochain
  rafraîchissement de panneau est à un intervalle de mise à jour — cinq minutes
  pour Géorisques. Mesuré : 13 entrées de légende encore à l'écran au-dessus
  d'une scène à zéro entité. Symétriquement, rien ne repeignait le panneau
  quand un scan ABOUTIT, donc une clé pouvait rester vide, ou décrire le pâté
  de maisons qu'on venait de quitter. Les six couches d'adresse annoncent
  désormais leurs changements de dessin.
- **La rampe de puissance était ordonnée, conforme aux deux tests de la règle,
  et trop sombre pour qu'on s'y repère.** Les pastilles livrées le matin même
  couraient de L\* 30,6 à 83,0, avec des écarts de 10 à 18, un ordre qui
  survivait en niveaux de gris et en deutéranopie simulée. Un lecteur les a
  regardées sur Bordeaux et a dit que la couleur était trop sombre pour un bon
  repérage. Il avait raison, et le chiffre qui le prouve n'est pas dans la
  rampe : les deux barreaux du bas — `lente` et `normale` — font **46 % des
  sites d'une ville française**. Une pastille sombre dans un jonc sombre sur
  une orthophoto est une tache sombre, quelle que soit sa teinte.

  **UNE RAMPE ORDONNÉE EN CLARTÉ A UN PROBLÈME DE PLANCHER, et les deux tests
  de la règle ne le voient pas** — ils mesurent l'ORDRE, jamais la VISIBILITÉ.
  Une échelle qui varie en valeur a, par construction, un bas sombre. La rampe
  dépense donc maintenant tout son ordre dans la **moitié claire** : L\* 54,1 →
  63,3 → 72,3 → 81,7 → 90,9. Entre le plus sombre qui se lise encore sur un
  fond sombre et le plus clair avant le blanc il reste 37 points, soit des
  écarts de 9,2 au lieu de 13 — plus serré, et suffisant.

  Le gain se mesure des deux côtés : **plancher remonté de 23,5 L\***, et
  séparation compositée sur quatre fonds témoins — eau, forêt, urbain clair,
  toit de tuiles — passée de **ΔE 21,4 à 35,5**, pour un seuil de perception de
  2,3. L'ordre survit toujours en gris (54 < 63 < 72 < 82 < 91) et en
  deutéranopie (40 → 46 → 52 → 68 → 93).

  Le gris de refus mesure L\* 54,8 : il est désormais au BAS de la rampe et non
  plus au milieu, donc la classe « puissance non exploitable » est aussi
  trouvable que n'importe quelle bande mesurée, et ce qui la distingue est sa
  FORME — la plaque creuse — et non sa teinte.
- **Le réseau électrique refusait de s'afficher sur la vue que le globe ouvre —
  et effaçait sa propre légende en le faisant.** Trois reproches, trois vraies
  pannes.

  **« Il faut un certain zoom, une CERTAINE INCLINAISON pour qu'il daigne se
  montrer. »** La boîte demandée au proxy était l'étendue de
  `computeViewRectangle`, et sur une caméra inclinée ce rectangle va jusqu'à
  L'HORIZON. Mesuré dans le navigateur, au-dessus de Bayonne, à 19,5 km : **0,278°
  de longitude à la verticale, 1,076° à 35° de tangage** — même altitude, boîte
  presque quatre fois plus large. Le plafond de 0,8° tombait pile entre les deux,
  donc la couche se chargeait à la verticale et se refusait à l'oblique, qui est
  l'attitude par défaut de ce globe. La boîte est maintenant centrée sur le point
  que la caméra REGARDE (`focusedViewBox`, le correctif que le cadastre et le GPU
  avaient déjà payé sur un rapport identique), dimensionnée sur l'altitude, et le
  portillon est l'altitude — 120 km. La caméra du rapport charge 326 km de tracé
  et 11 postes là où elle affichait « zoom in ».

  **« Le tracé se fait via un tout petit trait, c'est quasi invisible. »** Exact :
  1,6 à 3,2 px, une couleur posée nue sur une orthophoto, sans fond. Les bandes
  passent à 3–5,5 px et **chaque tracé est dessiné deux fois** — un fourreau
  quasi-noir plus large dessous, la couleur de tension par-dessus. C'est la seule
  réponse que la cartographie a pour un trait coloré sur une photo, et ce n'est
  pas une teinte plus criarde. (`PolylineOutline` ferait les deux en une passe et
  est inutilisable ici : le fragment shader des polylignes au sol de Cesium ne
  déclare jamais le `v_width` que ce matériau lit, donc la primitive ne se lie
  pas.)

  **« J'ai pas l'impression qu'il y ait une légende. »** Il y en avait une, et la
  couche la supprimait : une caméra passée au-dessus du plafond appelait
  `clearRendered()`, qui met `_payload` à `null`, et la clé des tensions est
  construite depuis `_payload.tiers`. Monter ne cessait donc pas d'ajouter — ça
  EFFAÇAIT. Une caméra qui bouge ne périme aucune géométrie cartographiée : ce
  qui est chargé reste dessiné, et clé, jusqu'à sortir du champ.

- **318 bornes étaient dessinées sur Bordeaux, et personne ne les trouvait — y
  compris celui qui les avait dessinées.** Un lecteur a regardé la ville depuis
  12 653 m, à la verticale, sur l'imagerie photoréaliste, et a dit que les
  points de charge se voyaient à peine. La preuve qu'il en a donnée est le
  constat lui-même : personne d'autre ne les a retrouvés dans sa capture non
  plus. Comptées dans cette vue exacte : **318 marques, chacune un disque de
  7 px** avec un filet d'un pixel, sur une ville de toits rouges, de rues
  grises et d'un fleuve brun.

  **LE FAISCEAU NE POUVAIT PAS COUVRIR POUR LA PASTILLE, et la raison est
  géométrique.** Le faisceau porte l'effectif, et c'est un vrai canal — mais
  c'est une verticale MONDE, donc ce qui arrive à l'écran vaut
  `L · cos(tangage)`. Mesuré dans cette même vue : le plus court faisceau à
  l'écran faisait **1,1 px**. Les faisceaux survivent sur les bords du cadre, où
  la verticale locale s'écarte de l'axe de visée, et meurent au milieu, là où
  l'œil se pose. Un canal de quantité qui disparaît à l'attitude de lecture la
  plus courante ne peut pas être en plus le canal de lisibilité.

  **LE DISQUE DEVIENT UNE PLAQUE AVEC UN ÉCLAIR POINÇONNÉ DEDANS.** C'est le
  traitement auquel ce dépôt est déjà arrivé deux fois contre ses propres
  mesures — une silhouette nue est introuvable sous 18 px sur une orthophoto,
  là où une pastille reste une pastille à 10 — et la distinction qui tranche est
  celle que `plantFiliereIcons.js` écrit : *un véhicule est un objet mobile
  qu'on suit, une centrale est un LIEU sur une photographie de lieux, qui se
  bat pour les mêmes pixels que les toits et les champs. Les marques de lieux
  portent une pastille.* Une borne est un lieu. `ev_station` — le sujet
  littéral — a été écarté : c'est un corps de pompe avec un petit éclair
  dedans, et poinçonné dans un disque à la taille où cette couche dessine,
  l'éclair se referme et ce qui survit est l'image d'une station-service.

  **ET SA TAILLE TIENT UN BUDGET D'ENCRE, EN AIRE.** Une plaque de 26 px est
  juste pour un bourg et fausse pour une ville. La première courbe décroissait
  linéairement avec le NOMBRE de marques, et c'était la mauvaise variable : le
  coût d'une plaque est son aire, donc une règle linéaire en effectif déborde
  au milieu de la plage, là où vivent la plupart des vues — mesuré sur
  Bordeaux, **602 marques couvraient 28,1 % du cadre**. La taille suit
  maintenant `√(budget / marques)`, bornée entre 16 et 26 px : la couverture
  est **plate à 15,6 %** du plafond jusqu'au plancher, et le cadre est mesuré
  plutôt que supposé, donc une petite fenêtre reçoit de plus petites plaques au
  lieu d'un tapis. Sous le plancher — 792 marques — la réponse est le **filtre
  de puissance**, pas une plaque illisible.

  Dans la vue exacte de la capture : **380 plaques de 23 px**, 15,6 % du cadre,
  contre 318 disques de 7 px et 1,2 %. Quatre rasters servent toute la flotte,
  la couleur de bande voyageant sur `billboard.color` — 4 000 marques coûtent
  quatre entrées d'atlas, pas 4 000.

### Added
- **Les 183 arbres remarquables de Paris avaient une ligne à eux, pour des
  données que la couche Îlots de fraîcheur dessinait déjà.** Le manifeste
  branché est retiré — même registre `les-arbres`, même colonne `remarquable`,
  même palier de légende. Ce qu'il avait et que la couche n'avait pas, c'est la
  PORTÉE : le registre des arbres est fermé au-dessus de **1 500 m** parce que
  219 432 points ne s'achètent pas par vue, si bien que depuis toute vue tenant
  Paris entier les arbres remarquables étaient invisibles ici et visibles
  là-bas.

  La portée passe donc dans une **cinquième puce, REMARQUABLES** : 183 lignes
  tiennent dans un seul document, la limite d'altitude ne les concerne pas, et
  ce sont les seuls arbres qu'un lecteur peut chercher depuis le ciel. Prouvé à
  **4 000 m** dans `qa:fraicheur-fr`, où le registre ordinaire reste dormant.

- **Un manifeste peut désormais être une PUCE plutôt qu'une ligne.** Un bloc
  `fusion: { into, chip }` dans `datasets/*.json` pose le jeu branché sur la
  ligne d'une couche du cœur. Cette moitié-là ne pouvait pas vivre dans
  `layerFusions.js`, validé à l'import contre l'ensemble scellé des couches du
  cœur : elle se fait dans `registerDataset()`, au seul moment où les deux
  côtés sont connus, et elle est RÉVERSIBLE — débrancher rend à la ligne hôte
  exactement ce qu'elle avait. Un hôte inconnu, ou un hôte qui est lui-même une
  puce, est refusé AVANT l'enregistrement : la couche n'aurait de commande nulle
  part.

  Premier usage : **les 186 434 défibrillateurs de la base GeoDAE**, qui seuls
  répondaient « où est le plus proche », question qu'on ne pose pas à un globe.
  La ligne « Médecins » devient **« Santé & secours »** et porte les deux — où
  sont les soins, et ce qu'un passant peut décrocher sans les attendre. Les
  pharmacies et les hôpitaux restent où ils sont, deux des quatorze familles
  d'« Équipements du quotidien » : les en sortir voudrait dire reconstruire le
  pack pour y laisser un trou.

- **Treize couches refusent de se dessiner au-dessus d'un plafond, et elles le
  disaient dans une sous-ligne d'un panneau qui peut être replié à 0×0.** Le
  lecteur regardait la France depuis 1 000 km avec « Réseau électrique »
  allumé : rien à l'écran, et la raison — « visible sous 120 km » — écrite en
  petit, à gauche, hors du regard. À cette altitude **douze des treize couches
  sont hors de leur plafond en même temps**.

  Une carte unique s'affiche désormais **à 42 % de la hauteur de la fenêtre** —
  au-dessus du centre, pour ne pas couvrir ce dont elle parle — et nomme les
  couches qui attendent : trois lignes au plus, puis « +N autres ». Les mots
  sont **ceux de la couche elle-même**, jamais une seconde phrase qui pourrait
  diverger de la ligne du panneau.

  Et là où la couche sait résoudre sa propre vue, la carte porte
  **« Zoomer ici »** : un clic, un vol de 1,6 s, la couche charge en arrivant.
  Trois couches savent le faire (Réseau électrique, Bâti 3D, Parcelles
  cadastrales) — `ensureViewGate()`, écrit en septembre, testé, documenté, et
  **que plus rien n'appelait** : l'appel automatique du gestionnaire a disparu
  du code quelque part entre la #35 et aujourd'hui. C'est ce qui rendait
  `npm run qa:view-gate` rouge par défaut. La carte est son premier appelant
  réel. Le rétablir au moment d'allumer une couche reste une décision à part :
  allumer une couche n'est pas, en soi, l'autorisation de déplacer la caméra de
  quelqu'un.

  Trois détails qui ne se voient pas : la carte **ne prend aucun clic** (seuls
  ses boutons en prennent — elle est posée au milieu d'un globe qu'on fait
  tourner à la souris) ; elle est **relue 600 ms et 1 600 ms après l'arrêt de la
  caméra**, parce qu'à l'instant du `moveEnd` la couche n'a pas encore conclu ;
  et la fermer vaut **pour la situation**, pas pour la session.

  Et elle **part sur la pression du bouton, en 140 ms** — pas à la fin du vol.
  Elle attendait que la COUCHE cesse d'être hors cadre : 1,6 s de caméra, puis
  les relectures programmées derrière, pendant lesquelles le bouton restait
  planté à l'écran. Presser « Zoomer ici » est la réponse à la question que la
  carte pose ; elle s'en va avec. Elle ne revient que si le vol n'a pas atteint
  le plafond — bouton réarmé.

  Au passage, **tous les messages de zoom passent au français et au même
  verbe** : onze couches sur treize disaient autre chose — trois en anglais
  (« descend below 120 km »), les autres « descends », « descendez » ou
  « rapprochez-vous » pour le même geste. C'est **zoome** partout.

- **Une vue sans aérien le DIT, au lieu de simplement ne rien dessiner.** Le
  lecteur a regardé le Trocadéro depuis 856 m et a demandé : « on est d'accord
  que les pylônes ne s'affichent pas ? » Il avait raison — zéro pylône dessiné —
  et la couche avait raison aussi : mesuré sur cette caméra exacte, **126,2 km de
  réseau cartographié dans cette vue, dont 126,2 km enterrés, soit 100 %**. Paris
  intra-muros n'a pas de ligne aérienne, et un câble n'a pas de pylônes ; les
  tirets oranges et verts SONT le câble.

  Ce qui manquait, c'est la phrase. **Une absence avec sa raison est une
  information ; une absence toute seule est un rapport de bug**, et celle-ci a
  coûté un aller-retour. La note sous la clé le dit maintenant.

  **Et 33 tronçons de cette boîte étaient tagués `power=line` en faisant 3 à
  45 m** — 499 m à eux tous : les liaisons *à l'intérieur* des postes. Sans
  garde-fou, un pylône aurait fini dessiné au milieu d'un poste électrique. Le
  seuil est à 150 m, bien sous une portée réelle entre deux pylônes (300 à 500 m
  sur une 400 kV française, donc aucune vraie ligne n'est exclue) et loin
  au-dessus de tout ce qu'un poste contient.

- **Des pylônes sur les lignes aériennes, posés là où quelqu'un en a relevé
  un.** Jusqu'ici l'aérien et l'enterré ne se distinguaient que par un trait
  plein contre un trait pointillé, et les `power=tower` n'étaient dessinés qu'en
  dessous de 0,25° de vue, en pastilles grises de 4 px — une taille à laquelle
  un pylône n'est pas une structure, c'est un grain.

  La marque est **`power_tower` de Temaki** (CC0, le glyphe de l'éditeur iD
  d'OpenStreetMap), teintée de la couleur de tension de la ligne qu'elle porte,
  **une tous les X mètres avec X résolu par la caméra** — elle s'espace quand on
  monte et redescend jusqu'à chaque nœud cartographié quand on descend.

  **Et aucune position n'est inventée.** Découper une ligne de 12 km en six
  morceaux de 2 km poserait cinq pylônes dans des champs. Ce n'est pas
  nécessaire, parce que la liste des nœuds d'un `power=line` EST sa liste de
  pylônes : mesuré le 2026-09-14 contre le proxy en direct, **574 nœuds sur 574
  tagués `power=tower` autour de Bayonne et 750 sur 775 autour de Saclay** sont
  des sommets d'une ligne aérienne que cette couche dessine — et les 25 manquants
  de Saclay appartiennent chacun à une voie qu'elle exclut volontairement, dont
  une `disused:power=line` dont l'acier est toujours debout. Le rythme est donc
  tenu en SAUTANT des sommets, jamais en en interpolant un. La fiche dit laquelle
  des deux choses on a cliqué : un pylône avec sa référence et sa hauteur relevée,
  ou un sommet de la voie cartographiée.


## [Unreleased] — 2026-09-10

### Changed
- **Deux rues perpendiculaires traversaient le même carrefour en même temps, et
  le boulevard Saint-Michel roulait à 66 km/h sous un panneau 30.** Les points
  du trafic sont une simulation — les tuiles TomTom portent un ratio de
  congestion par tronçon, jamais un véhicule — mais la simulation ignorait deux
  choses que n'importe qui voit depuis une vue aérienne : les feux et les
  limitations.

  **IL N'Y AVAIT AUCUN CARREFOUR DANS LE MODÈLE.** Chaque point suivait une way
  OSM d'un bout à l'autre, et le seul feu rouge était un dé lancé à 0,8 % par
  franchissement, sans aucune corrélation entre deux rues. Une horloge unique de
  **70 s** les met d'accord : les rues d'azimut 0–90° passent pendant
  35 s, celles de 90–180° pendant les 35 suivantes. Deux rues perpendiculaires
  tombent toujours dans des phases opposées — c'est une propriété de
  l'arithmétique, pas un réglage, et un test l'énumère sur tout le cercle.

  **ET LE CARREFOUR EST LE VRAI CARREFOUR.** Un nœud que deux ways se partagent,
  trouvé dans la géométrie déjà chargée — aucune requête Overpass en plus. La
  première version s'arrêtait deux segments avant la FIN DE LA WAY, ce qui n'est
  pas le même endroit : les points se figeaient au milieu de la rue pendant que
  ceux déjà engagés traversaient le croisement. Mesuré sur la vue de la capture :
  1 008 nœuds de carrefour, dont **66 au beau milieu d'une way**, que la règle
  « fin de way » ne pouvait pas voir. Un point qui n'a plus de place dans la file
  s'arrête sur place plutôt que de passer au rouge.

  ```
  file   .:-+* .:---=== :--=          ← la file se remplit puis se vide
  vert  00000011111111100000          ← l'axe qui passe
  ```

  Mesuré aux 4 vrais croisements de la vue : quand un axe est au rouge, **jusqu'à
  75 % de ses points sont à l'arrêt et 0,0 % de ceux de l'axe vert**.

  **LA LIMITE LÉGALE EST UN PLAFOND, PAS UNE CONSIGNE.** `maxspeed` d'OSM
  n'était lu nulle part ; la vitesse sortait de la seule classe de voirie. Elle
  est maintenant `min(classe, limite affichée)` — le sens compte : substituer
  la limite aurait rendu les autoroutes **44 % plus rapides** (130 au lieu des
  90 qu'on y roule vraiment) en payant un gain de réalisme par une régression.
  Sur la vue qui a signalé le défaut (place Edmond-Rostand, 242 ways, 100 %
  tagguées) : 48 ways bridées, les 30 `primary` passent de **50 à 30 km/h**, les
  15 `secondary` de 40 à 30, et le point le plus rapide de l'écran tombe de
  **66 à 39 km/h**.

  Une autoroute ne fait jamais la queue (elle n'a pas de carrefour), un
  rond-point non plus (il existe pour s'en passer), et un point recyclé prend
  aussitôt sa place dans la file du bloc où il entre — sans quoi les rues d'un
  seul segment, dont l'unique franchissement EST le recyclage, ne s'arrêtaient
  jamais. Un axe attend, la carte ne gèle pas : moins de 16 % des points de
  l'écran sont à l'arrêt au pic.

  **ET LE CADRE EST LÀ SANS QU'ON LE DEMANDE.** Allumer Trafic routier allume
  la couche Détection : un point nu ne dit rien, le cadre en fait un contact
  lisible — identifiant, crochets, et en mode live une bordure teintée par la
  congestion, dont le canvas passe au-dessus de la chaîne post-FX. C'est le
  mécanisme de Contacts, inchangé : l'activation prend un instantané, la
  désactivation le rejoue. Éteindre le trafic rend donc exactement l'état de
  détection d'avant, y compris OFF. Un seul propriétaire et un seul
  instantané — deux, et chacun restaurerait l'état pré-existant de l'autre.

  Nouveau harnais `npm run qa:traffic-signals`, qui n'assert sur aucun pixel :
  aucune entité Cesium ne se peint en headless, donc la preuve lit le modèle —
  y compris à l'échelle où un lecteur regarde vraiment, un croisement à la fois.

- **Une aire du Pays Basque disait « 1 avail » puis « 1 e-bike » : cinq lignes
  et deux langues pour un seul vélo.** La fiche des véhicules partagés était le
  dernier écran de la couche resté en anglais abrégé — `avail`, `docks`, `cap`,
  `Bay` — sous une ligne de licence française qui ne parlait pas du lieu mais du
  jeu de données. Elle est en français, et elle dit ce qu'elle sait :

  ```
  Aire Pony                                       ← « Pony Bay »
  🚲 1 VAE disponible                             ← « 🚲 1 avail » + « ↳ 1 e-bike »
  🅿️ Pony Pays Basque
  ```

  **LA VENTILATION NE SE RÉPÈTE PLUS.** Une catégorie qui porte tout le compte
  se nomme sur la première ligne ; la seconde disparaît. Sur une vraie station
  elle reste et devient lisible : `🚲 7 vélos disponibles sur 11 places · 4
  bornes libres` puis `dont 5 mécaniques et 2 VAE`. Une aire peinte a des
  *places* libres, une station à bornes des *bornes*.

  **LE PICTOGRAMME SUIT L'INVENTAIRE PUBLIÉ.** Un vélo au-dessus d'une station
  d'autopartage était l'image du mauvais véhicule ; une station Citiz porte
  maintenant `🚗`. Et le faux ami du GBFS est épinglé par un test : `scooter`
  est la trottinette, `moped` est le scooter — une traduction littérale aurait
  interverti les deux silhouettes.

  **DEUX LIGNES PARTENT, UNE ARRIVE.** La licence du flux n'est pas un fait sur
  la borne d'en face. « Garé et disponible — un véhicule loué n'est jamais
  publié » est vrai de chaque glyphe à l'écran : c'est la légende qui le dit,
  une fois, au lieu de la fiche à chaque clic. En échange, un flux qui ne
  publie pas son stock l'annonce — `Inventaire non publié` — au lieu de
  ressembler à une station vide, que la couleur distingue pourtant déjà.

  La ligne d'état, les libellés de catégorie et le nom de la couche suivent :
  **Véhicules partagés (FR)**, `2 opérateurs · vélos seuls · 447 aires vides
  masquées`, Vélo · VAE · Trottinette · Scooter · Voiture.
- **La légende cachait 29 % d'elle-même, et la moitié qu'elle montrait parlait
  d'une ville à 700 km.** Sur une vue de Biarritz, le panneau `LEGEND` mesurait
  434 px de contenu dans une fenêtre de 308 px : le bloc **Longue traîne FR** —
  la seule couche qui avait des points à l'écran — était entièrement sous la
  ligne de flottaison, jamais lu. Ce qui occupait la place au-dessus décrivait
  561 sites du **Pouls vélo**, tous à Paris ou à Lyon.

  **CHAQUE LIGNE REDISAIT SON ÉTIQUETTE.** `< 20 %` était suivi de « Part du
  maximum hebdomadaire du site — < 20 % ». Six classes occupaient douze lignes
  pour ne rien ajouter. La phrase est vraie de toutes les classes : elle est
  dite **une fois**, au-dessus. Même correction côté exploitants, où « une
  teinte partout en France » se répétait à l'identique sur chaque opérateur en
  vue — six fois sur un viewport parisien.

  **UNE CLÉ DIT MAINTENANT OÙ ELLE S'APPLIQUE.** `Longue traîne FR · 87 ici`,
  `Semaine type · Lyon et Paris, hors de cette vue`. Et le bloc qui a des
  points à l'écran passe **devant** celui qui n'en a pas. Le silence n'est pas
  une rétrogradation : une couche qui ne mesure pas son étendue garde sa place.

  **LES CLASSES ORDONNÉES DEVIENNENT UNE BARRE.** Six lignes empilées ne
  montraient jamais la forme de la distribution, qui est pourtant tout l'
  argument de la couche. Un seul rail segmenté la donne d'un coup d'œil, et les
  comptes exacts restent écrits à côté de leur pastille. Deux mesures ont dicté
  le dessin : la marche la plus sombre de la rampe est à **1,83:1** contre le
  verre du cockpit — d'où le filet clair sur chaque segment et un plancher de
  largeur, sans quoi « ≥ 80 % » serait un cheveu d'une couleur déjà presque
  invisible ; et deux marches voisines ne sont qu'à **ΔE 14,6** en vision
  normale — d'où les 2 px de fond entre segments.

  **LE MÊME ENSEMBLE, COMPTÉ DEUX FOIS.** La couche partagée peint deux canaux
  — la forme dit *quoi*, la couleur dit *qui* — et la clé n'en nommait aucun :
  76 stations + 8 VAE puis 77 Pony + 7 Citiz, soit 84 objets qu'un lecteur
  pouvait additionner à 168. Les canaux portent leur nom (`forme = quoi`,
  `couleur = qui`), leurs entrées se posent côte à côte, et une phrase dit ce
  qu'aucun intertitre ne peut dire : c'est un seul ensemble, lu deux fois.

  **CE QUE ÇA DONNE.** Biarritz : **233 px, rien de coupé** (contre 434 dont 126
  invisibles). Paris, le cas le plus chargé — six exploitants, trois formes, six
  bandes — : **292 px, rien de coupé**. Aucune licence n'apparaît dans ce
  panneau, ni avant ni après.
- **Les trois quarts de la clé des séismes étaient hors de vue de la carte
  qu'elle légendait — et un point de séisme ne s'ouvrait pas.** Mesuré dans
  Chrome à 1440×900 sur le flux vivant du 2026-09-10 (29 événements, cette
  couche seule) : **827 px de contenu dans une fenêtre de 216**, soit 31 lignes
  et 375 mots dont l'essentiel ne se lisait qu'en faisant défiler.

  **UNE RÈGLE GRADUÉE N'EST PAS UNE CLÉ.** Quatre disques d'une seule encre ne
  différant que par leur diamètre, et quatre barres d'une seule encre ne
  différant que par leur hauteur, c'est la marque réimprimée huit fois — le
  même constat que la clé des bouées (#141) et l'échelle des cinq bandes du
  trafic routier (#166). Ce qu'aucune forme ne dit, c'est où l'échelle
  **s'arrête** : chaque canal tient désormais en une ligne qui publie son
  domaine gelé, « Point — magnitude, M2,5 à M9,5 » et « Tige — profondeur du
  foyer, 0 à 700 km ». La rampe de COULEUR garde toutes ses classes et leurs
  effectifs : c'est le seul canal qu'aucune forme ne décode (CARTOGRAPHIE D1).
  **215 px, 11 lignes, 93 mots** — sur ce flux, la clé tient sans défiler.

  **LES MISES EN GARDE PARTENT SUR LA FICHE DE L'ÉVÉNEMENT.** Cliquer un point
  de séisme — ou son étiquette flottante `M4.1`, qui était jusqu'ici une
  légende non cliquable cinq fois plus large que le disque qu'elle nomme —
  ouvre une petite fenêtre portant la magnitude, le lieu, **l'instant en UTC**
  et l'âge (E1), la profondeur du foyer et l'identifiant USGS. Chaque mise en
  garde y est collée au nombre qu'elle qualifie, et nulle part ailleurs : « la
  magnitude, pas l'énergie — +1 sur l'échelle vaut ×31,6 » à côté du diamètre,
  « la tige porte cette longueur VERS LE HAUT » à côté de la profondeur. Une
  phrase lue à côté de son chiffre porte ; la même phrase dans un bloc
  permanent est du mobilier.

  Le clic laisse un **anneau cyan distinct** plutôt que de repeindre la marque :
  son diamètre est la magnitude, son remplissage l'âge, et son contour l'âge
  aussi quand la profondeur manque — il ne restait aucun canal à emprunter.
  Échap, un clic sur le monde, un relevé qui fait sortir l'événement de la
  fenêtre de 24 h et l'extinction de la couche referment tous la fiche.

  Deux divulgations quittent la clé pour l'aparté A5 qui leur revient : la tige
  plancher d'1 km (seule rupture du 1:1) et le plafond des étiquettes, avec
  leurs effectifs. Reste en clé la seule forme qu'un lecteur décode **faux**
  sans aide : le point creux d'une profondeur non publiée, qu'on lirait sinon
  comme une petite secousse.

### Fixed
- **Parler pendant qu'une couche charge la tuait : la voix rendait `irve-fr`
  éteinte et vide, la main la remplissait de 139 bornes 45 ms plus tard.**
  L'opérateur demandait une source, la voix répondait qu'il y avait une erreur
  avec elle, et le même toggle fait à la main marchait du premier coup. La
  source n'y était pour rien. `input_audio_buffer.speech_started` — le simple
  fait de se remettre à parler — annule tous les outils en vol, et
  `set_layer_visibility` refilait ce signal au gestionnaire de couches, qui le
  relit à quatre phases de cycle de vie et répond à une annulation par
  `module.disable()`.

  **LE PREMIER ALLUMAGE D'UNE COUCHE DURE DES SECONDES.** Mesuré au-dessus de
  Bordeaux : 5,5 s pour `irve-fr` dans une vraie session Realtime, 3,0 à 4,5 s
  en headless. Un tour de parole en fait 6. N'importe quel mot prononcé dans
  cette fenêtre tuait le chargement — y compris finir sa phrase après que le
  modèle a déclenché l'outil. Et l'ironie du diagnostic : la tentative vocale
  ratée payait quand même le `init()`, donc le toggle manuel qui suivait
  répondait en 45 ms et semblait innocenter tout le reste.

  **DEUX FORMES DE PANNE, UNE SEULE CAUSE.** `irve-fr` et `medecins-fr`
  revenaient ÉTEINTES avec `{ok:false, cancelled:true, phase:'init'}` et le
  modèle annonçait un échec de la source ; `traffic` revenait ALLUMÉE et
  définitivement à 0 enregistrement pendant que l'outil rapportait `ok:true` —
  une couche cochée sur une carte vide. Après correction, même annulation au
  même instant : 139, 535 et 3 023 enregistrements.

  **LE SIGNAL DE L'APPELANT NE DÉCIDAIT RIEN.** Le gestionnaire supersède déjà
  une requête concurrente par son propre protocole d'époques
  (`activeVisibilityIntent.controller.abort(SUPERSEDED_VISIBILITY_INTENT)`) :
  le signal ne choisissait pas quel état gagne, seulement si la transaction
  perdante laissait une couche à moitié construite derrière elle. `isCurrent`
  continue de filtrer ce qui est DIT, donc un tour supersédé s'annonce comme
  tel — sans casser la carte pour le faire.

  **LA RADIO GARDE LE SIGNAL.** Son allumage démarre du SON, et parler
  par-dessus une station est une demande de l'arrêter — `setRadioEnabled` le
  transmet déjà délibérément pour cette raison. Les deux moitiés sont épinglées
  par un test unique, `barge-in never tears down a data layer load, and radio
  still stops for it`.
- **Une vue de la France entière offrait 51 étiquettes, 28 disaient le même
  mot, et les petites centrales disparaissaient dessous.** Sur la couche
  **Centrales EDF** filtrée sur `Hydraulique › Tous`, à 991 km d'altitude, les
  51 sites dessinés demandaient tous leur nom et l'hôte les acceptait tous
  (plafond 60) ; 28 de ces libellés se terminaient par « retenue de lac » sous
  une puce HYDRAULIQUE déjà allumée, et le nom d'une centrale se posait sur la
  marque de sa voisine — l'Aigle et Grandval avaient disparu sous le texte qui
  nommait les plus grosses.

  **UN NOM N'EST PAS DÛ À CHAQUE SITE À CHAQUE ALTITUDE.** Un libellé porte
  désormais un plafond d'altitude tiré du rang du site par puissance installée
  DANS LA SÉLECTION QUE LE LECTEUR REGARDE : les dix premiers se lisent depuis
  l'orbite, les suivants reviennent en descendant, sous ~460 km puis sous
  ~230 km. Le rang se lit dans la cohorte filtrée et pas dans la flotte : ayant
  demandé l'hydraulique, on doit obtenir les plus grands barrages, pas un écran
  où chaque nom appartient au nucléaire parce que le plus petit réacteur pèse
  plus lourd que la plus grande retenue. Une étiquette fondue ne coûte rien :
  l'hôte la rend avant de la mesurer, donc elle ne retient plus le créneau qui
  écrasait la marque d'à côté, et cela sans un seul écouteur de caméra.

  **LE LIBELLÉ CESSE DE RÉPÉTER LE FILTRE.** Filière choisie, il dit
  `BORT · 235 MW`. Le régime reste sur la fiche et compté sur la bande de
  sous-catégories, qui en est déjà la légende et le seul endroit où le lecteur
  peut agir dessus. Sous TOUTES la phrase revient, parce que là elle est la
  seule chose qui sépare un réacteur d'un régime d'eau. Ce que ça coûte est
  nommé : le compte de réacteurs quitte le globe tant que NUCLÉAIRE est allumé,
  et reste sur la fiche.

  **SOUS 20 px, LA PASTILLE GARDE SON ENCRE.** La découpe est la première chose
  que la minification détruit : sous ce seuil la silhouette cesse d'être une
  forme et devient une tache au milieu de la pastille, qui mange justement
  l'aire colorée nommant la filière. Mesuré sur la flotte vivante le
  2026-09-10, **53 sites sur 79** dessinent sous 20 px — 46 hydrauliques,
  7 thermiques, et aucun nucléaire : les 18 réacteurs gardent tous leur tour de
  refroidissement. Le choix se fait sur la taille propre de la marque, donc il
  ne coûte aucune passe par image, et la clé continue de décoder la couleur.
- **Le plus gros canal de la carte des bornes disait la même chose 960 fois, et
  le nombre de prises tenait dans 0,44 pixel.** Sur une vue du Pays basque, la
  couche **Bornes IRVE** dressait 960 faisceaux verticaux **tous longs de
  55,8 px** : leur longueur était le NOMBRE DE MARQUEURS à l'écran, pas une
  mesure. Le chiffre qu'un lecteur de cette couche veut — combien de points de
  charge — était sur le diamètre du disque, où un parking de 2 prises faisait
  3,99 px et un de 6 prises 4,43 px.

  **LA HAUTEUR DEVIENT LE NOMBRE DE POINTS DE CHARGE.** L'information ne naît
  pas, elle **déménage** : 0,44 px de diamètre deviennent 13,5 px de hauteur
  sur le même couple. Racine carrée sur un domaine gelé de 24 prises — mesuré
  sur les 40 028 sites du registre, médiane 4, p95 16, maximum 606 : une règle
  linéaire écraserait **57 %** du fichier sur son plancher, ou en écrêterait
  **6,7 %**, alors que la racine n'a besoin d'aucun plancher et couvre
  **98,1 %** des sites. Le disque repasse à une taille constante par régime :
  c'est une position, rien d'autre.

  **ET LA RÈGLE EST CORRIGÉE DU TANGAGE, sinon la légende ment dès qu'on
  incline.** Un faisceau est vertical dans le monde ; ce qu'on mesure à l'écran
  vaut `L · cos(tangage)` — 87 % à −30°, la vue d'ouverture, 50 % à −60°, et
  **zéro au nadir**, où une verticale se projette en un point. Corrigé, borné à
  −70°, et la clé cesse de promettre une règle au-delà.

- **La rampe de puissance descendait de 20 niveaux de gris entre la charge la
  plus rapide et la plus lente.** Mesurée en clarté CIE L\* sur les encres
  livrées : 51,0 → 68,8 → 79,4 → **76,9 → 58,9**. L'échelle montait, faisait
  demi-tour et retombait, si bien qu'en niveaux de gris la charge haute
  puissance lisait **plus sombre** que la charge lente. Deux des cinq encres
  étaient en outre déjà prises, à l'identique, par deux autres couches —
  `#4c6ef5` est le « Travaux achevés » de Sitadel, `#7c8899` l'« autre » des
  écoles.

  La rampe est remplacée par une échelle **monotone en clarté** : 30,6 → 48,7 →
  61,9 → 72,9 → 83,0, dix points d'écart au minimum. Les deux tests de la règle
  passent au lieu d'être affirmés : en niveaux de gris l'ordre survit, et en
  deutéranopie simulée aussi (28,7 → 40,6 → 46,5 → 58,2 → 80,8). Compositées à
  l'alpha du faisceau sur trois fonds témoins — eau, forêt, urbain clair — deux
  classes voisines restent séparées d'au moins **ΔE 19,3**, pour un seuil de
  perception d'environ 2,3.

  **« Puissance non exploitable » quitte la rampe.** Elle était en ardoise à
  L\* 56,3, soit **2,6 clartés** de la haute puissance à 58,9 : la classe qui
  veut dire « nous n'avons pas su lire » était, en gris, la même marque que la
  charge la plus rapide de France. Elle est maintenant un **anneau creux** dans
  le graphite que le dépôt réserve aux refus — un motif, pas une teinte, et un
  motif survit aux passes NVG et FLIR.

- **La clé publiait six classes, en affichait trois, et n'avait pas d'horloge.**
  Mesuré sur la même vue en 1440×900 : la troisième classe était coupée en plein
  mot, et chacune des six portait la **même phrase de 19 mots** — « Counted as
  SITES over the sampled maillage… » — répétée à l'identique, **en anglais**,
  dans un panneau français. Rien ne disait quand un opérateur avait déposé, sur
  un fichier dont un dixième n'a pas bougé depuis 2023.

  La phrase répétée sort des six classes et devient **une** note sous le bloc ;
  la provenance et l'horloge deviennent la ligne du bloc. Six lignes courtes
  tiennent. L'horloge est celle des **opérateurs** (`date_maj`) et jamais celle
  du proxy — et elle refuse les dépôts datés dans l'avenir : mesuré le
  2026-09-10, **56 lignes sur 227 007** sont estampillées 2026-12-30, si bien
  que le maximum brut daterait toute la clé nationale de trois mois en avance.
  Le vrai dernier dépôt est le **31/08/2026**, et les 56 lignes écartées sont
  comptées à côté.

  **Et le libellé dit son unité.** Le même mot « sites » comptait des cellules
  de carroyage au large et des points de charge en ville. Chaque régime nomme
  désormais ce qu'il a compté, dans la ligne comme dans la clé.


- **Le Pays Basque affichait 561 punaises dont 447 disaient « rien ici », et
  toutes portaient le même mot.** Sur la vue de Biarritz, la couche **Vélos et
  véhicules partagés** étiquetait chaque point `basque_country_parking`, et la
  fiche d'une punaise annonçait `basque_country_parking_71849_zidUNB5KA8I —
  0 avail`, alors que Pony a bien des vélos dans cette agglomération.

  **UN NOM QUI RÉPÈTE SA CLÉ N'EST PAS UN NOM.** Dix systèmes Pony publient le
  `station_id` dans le champ `name` — **4 959 lignes** sur le catalogue vivant,
  mesuré le 2026-09-10 (Angers 1 451, Perpignan 1 040, Pays Basque 539). GEV
  l'imprimait tel quel. L'écho est maintenant refusé au seul point de lecture
  du texte GBFS, et le point retombe sur ce qui est encore connu : son
  exploitant. « Pony Bay » remplace un identifiant que personne ne peut lire.
  Les vrais toponymes du même flux survivent — « Gare de Bayonne » et « Route
  des Cimes » restent affichés.

  **UNE BAIE PEINTE VIDE N'EST PAS UN DOCK VIDE.** Une station virtuelle est un
  polygone dessiné sur une carte : ni borne, ni matériel, rien où marcher. Vide,
  elle dit ce que le reste de la carte dit déjà. Un dock PHYSIQUE vide dit
  l'inverse — une borne Vélib' sans vélo est une information sur laquelle on
  agit — et il reste dessiné. Mesuré le 2026-09-10 : **7 077 baies virtuelles
  vides contre 476 docks physiques vides**. Seul un zéro PUBLIÉ compte : une
  station absente de `station_status`, ou un flux d'état en panne, garde son
  point, parce que « on ne sait pas » ne doit pas se peindre en « c'est vide ».

  **L'ÂGE DU RELEVÉ REVIENT SUR 56 SYSTÈMES.** GBFS 3.0 a changé le type de
  `last_reported` — entier POSIX → chaîne RFC3339 — et la moitié du catalogue
  français a suivi. Un lecteur qui n'acceptait qu'un nombre laissait tomber le
  champ sur **11 110 véhicules de 56 systèmes sur 106**, et une carte sans âge
  se lit « à l'instant », soit l'inverse de ce que ces flux disent.

  **CE QUE ÇA DONNE À L'ÉCRAN.** Sur la vue de la capture (Biarritz, 6 300 m) :
  **95 objets au lieu de 561**, tous tenant au moins un véhicule, et le
  sous-titre de la couche dit ce qu'il a caché — « 2 operators · 392 empty bays
  hidden ». Aucune étiquette n'est plus un identifiant de flux.

- **Une fiche se referme en cliquant la carte — sur trois couches de plus, et
  la carte redevient cliquable sur sept autres.** Le correctif posé sur les
  arrêts IDFM (#162) était le même bug à quatre endroits, et le balayage l'a
  trouvé plus large que prévu.

  **CE QUI EST MESURÉ.** « Le lecteur a cliqué la carte » s'écrivait `!picked` :
  `scene.pick` ne répond rien pour le globe nu, qui n'est pas une primitive.
  La surface photoréaliste a mis fin à ça en silence. Sondé le 2026-09-10
  au-dessus de Paris à 700 m, 470 tuiles chargées : **six sondes réparties sur
  l'écran, six retours non falsy**, chacun un objet dont la primitive est le
  `Cesium3DTileset` et dont le `id` — comme le `primitive.id` — est `undefined`.

  **LE PRÉDICAT DURABLE EST L'APPARTENANCE, PAS LA PRÉSENCE.** Une tuile ne
  porte aucun identifiant, donc personne ne peut la revendiquer ni la
  sélectionner : `pickRegistry.isWorldPick()` répond « c'est la carte » pour le
  clic vide, pour le terrain et pour le photoréaliste de la même manière, là où
  `!picked` était une affirmation sur la surface qui se trouvait allumée.
  `localGeojson.js` avait déjà tiré cette conclusion dans un commentaire à côté
  de son propre gestionnaire ; elle est maintenant dans le module partagé, pour
  que le prochain gestionnaire en hérite au lieu de la redécouvrir.

  **CE QUE ÇA DÉBLOQUE.** Le **Pouls vélo** et le **Carroyage INSEE** ferment
  enfin leur fiche. Et surtout la fabrique partagée `addressScanLayer.js`, dont
  les DEUX issues tournées vers la carte étaient mortes pour ses sept couches :
  la fiche ne se refermait pas, et surtout `ground` ne partait plus — donc sur
  **urbanisme-gpu**, **bruit-fr** et **isochrone-rings**, cliquer la parcelle ne
  faisait plus rien du tout. C'est pourtant le geste que ces couches
  existent pour servir : le sol n'y est pas un fond, c'est le sujet.

  Le clic sur le marqueur d'une couche voisine reste `ignore` dans la fabrique,
  inchangé : cette décision-là parle de ne pas parler par-dessus la fiche d'un
  voisin, et le photoréalisme n'a rien à en dire.

  **`delinquance-fr` n'était PAS touchée**, contrairement à ce qu'un premier
  balayage annonçait : son gestionnaire finit sur un `clearSelection()`
  inconditionnel, donc le clic sur une tuile y tombait déjà juste. Son
  court-circuit `if (!picked)` était mort, et il est retiré — c'est exactement
  la forme que les quatre autres ont copiée.

  **Un harnais navigateur nouveau, `npm run qa:card-dismissal`**, prend le pick
  sur le TILESET QUI TOURNE et le donne à la règle de chaque couche. Les tests
  unitaires épinglent la même règle contre une forme écrite à la main, ce qui
  est la croyance de l'auteur du test sur ce que Cesium renvoie ; celui-ci
  échoue si Cesium se met un jour à étiqueter ses tuiles. 13 vérifications.

### Added
- **Un plancher de puissance sur la couche Bornes IRVE — `TOUT · > 22 kW ·
  > 50 kW · > 150 kW`.** 960 marques qui disent toutes « il y a de la recharge
  ici » ne répondent pas à la question qu'un conducteur se pose. Les crans sont
  les **bornes de l'échelle de bandes elle-même** et non des nombres ronds :
  « ≥ 22 kW » serait indécidable, un point à 11 kW étant `normale`, dont le
  plafond EST 22. Mesuré sur le registre national : 50,7 % des sites passent
  « > 22 kW », 24,1 % « > 50 kW », 10,9 % « > 150 kW ».

  Un site dont la puissance publiée est hors gabarit (3,3 % du registre) est
  **masqué et compté**, jamais affiché comme franchissant le seuil : rien ne dit
  qu'il le franchit, rien ne dit qu'il ne le franchit pas. Le régime exact
  bascule un drapeau et ne reconstruit jamais sa collection ; le maillage
  repique, parce que le plancher change quel site représente une cellule —
  mesuré à 1 à 12 ms sur 40 028 tuples.

### Changed
- **Le maillage des bornes se recomposait à chaque déplacement de caméra.** Ses
  cellules étaient une fraction de la vue : un panoramique d'un kilomètre
  déplaçait chaque frontière d'un kilomètre, un autre site gagnait chaque
  cellule, et la carte se redessinait pendant que le pays ne bougeait pas.
  Mesuré sur une vue France panée de 0,05° — environ 5 km, un glissement
  ordinaire : **179 marques sur 1 100 survivaient**.

  Les cellules sont maintenant des carrés du **graticule**, à pas gelé par
  palier de zoom (0,25° / 0,0625° / 0,015625°, un quadtree, donc un changement
  de palier subdivise au lieu de rebattre). Sur le même panoramique :
  **1 050 marques sur 1 057**, et les sept qui bougent sont celles qui sont
  entrées ou sorties du cadre. Chaque marque porte désormais le **total complet
  de sa cellule** — tous les sites additionnés, plus un échantillon — et sa
  fiche donne les deux chiffres séparément : ce que contient la cellule, et ce
  que contient le site réel sur lequel la marque est posée. La clé déclare la
  taille de la cellule en kilomètres à la latitude où elle est dessinée, parce
  qu'une maille en degrés n'est pas équi-aire : 20,6 km de large à Perpignan
  contre 17,5 km à Lille.

- **Un arrêt IDFM ne porte plus qu'une seule marque, et on la voit.** La couche
  fusionnée dessinait le pictogramme du mode ET la pastille de fréquence sur le
  même point. Le lecteur qui l'a vue a dit la chose évidente : c'est un seul
  sujet dessiné deux fois, et les deux chiffres sont joints de toute façon. Il
  avait raison — l'argument pour l'empilement portait sur des pixels, pas sur
  ce qui est dit.

  **LE PICTOGRAMME EST DEVENU UN BADGE, et il a grandi.** 14–24 px de trait
  blanc teinté `#c9d4e0` deviennent 21–27 px de disque plein avec le
  pictogramme dedans. Le mode le plus nombreux du référentiel est le bus, et
  au-dessus d'un Paris photoréaliste `#c9d4e0` est du trait gris pâle sur des
  toits gris pâle : « gris sur gris », mot pour mot, dans le rapport. Une
  marque pleine apporte son propre fond au lieu d'espérer une teinte plus
  chanceuse. Le même constat a été mesuré le même jour sur les sites
  militaires, plus bas dans cette entrée : sur trois fonds réels, une
  silhouette nue devient introuvable sous 18 px là où une pastille tient à 10.

  Une différence, et c'est celle qui décide de la fabrication : la pastille
  militaire reste teintable par Cesium parce que sa silhouette est un TROU, et
  ce qui se voit à travers est un noir fixe. Ici la moitié de l'échelle est plus
  sombre que ce noir. L'encre du pictogramme est donc choisie sur la LUMINANCE
  du remplissage et cuite dans le SVG, parce qu'une teinte Cesium multiplie et
  ne peut donc jamais éclaircir ni retourner une encre. Deux bords, un sombre
  et un clair, pour qu'il y en ait toujours un qui tranche sur l'imagerie.

  **LE BADGE PORTE LA FRÉQUENCE DANS SON REMPLISSAGE**, donc rien n'est perdu
  en retirant la pastille : le mode est la FORME, le débit est la COULEUR. La
  pastille ne s'efface que là où un badge dessine déjà cet arrêt — dans une vue
  dense la page de 100 arrêts du référentiel en laisse la plupart à l'écran, et
  les 1 200 profils restent tous chiffrés, comptés et en légende.

  **LA LÉGENDE SUIT LES REMPLISSAGES.** Au-dessus de la porte de fréquence, ou
  dans une boîte que le proxy a refusée, aucun débit n'a été lu : les badges
  nomment leur mode et la légende liste les MODES à l'écran avec leurs
  effectifs. Jusqu'ici elle y affichait les six échelons de l'échelle à zéro et
  la ligne du silence à zéro — une légende qui ne décrivait rien de ce qui était
  dessiné. En vue chiffrée elle gagne une ligne : les arrêts du référentiel
  sans aucune ligne dans le fichier d'offre, dans le gris `#8a93a6` que tout le
  dépôt réserve à « non mesuré », qui n'est pas la couleur du passage nul —
  laquelle est une mesure.

- **Un clic sur un arrêt est une question, et il y est répondu.** La fiche
  affichait « Offre horaire non lue à cette altitude — rapprochez-vous pour la
  fréquence » au-dessus de la porte, et un « Aucun profil horaire publié pour
  cet arrêt » plat dans une boîte que le proxy avait refusée — ce qui n'était
  pas seulement inutile, c'était FAUX, puisque rien n'avait été demandé. Les
  deux renvoyaient le plafond de la CARTE à quelqu'un qui avait déjà réduit sa
  question à un point.

  Un clic nomme une coordonnée, et la boîte légale la plus petite autour d'une
  coordonnée est une cellule de la grille de 0,005° du proxy — cinq appels
  amont, mis en cache sur disque. C'est abordable au clic et c'est exactement ce
  qui ne l'est pas par vue de 1 200 arrêts : la porte borne désormais le DESSIN
  et jamais la réponse. Tous les profils que la boîte a payés sont gardés, donc
  le clic suivant dans la même rue est gratuit. La seule absence que la fiche
  peut encore signaler est mesurée : un arrêt sans aucune ligne dans le fichier
  d'offre (3 053 sur 37 956, 8,0 %). Une panne amont dit panne, jamais zéro.

  **La carte ne bouge pas pour autant** : un badge portant un débit au milieu
  de cent badges portant leur mode se lirait comme une différence de service.

- **La fiche d'un arrêt se referme en cliquant la carte.** Le gestionnaire
  fermait sur `!picked` — sur l'absence totale de quoi que ce soit sous le
  curseur. Au-dessus d'un globe photoréaliste il y a TOUJOURS quelque chose
  sous le curseur : le clic atterrit sur la tuile 3D du toit ou de la
  chaussée, donc la condition était fausse partout dans Paris et la fenêtre
  était impossible à chasser. N'importe quel clic qui n'est pas sur un de nos
  arrêts la ferme maintenant, y compris sur le marqueur d'une autre couche —
  la fiche répond « cet arrêt », et le lecteur vient de désigner autre chose.

- **La fiche ne finit plus sur ses licences.** « Île-de-France Mobilités —
  réseau ODbL 1.0 · fréquence Licence Ouverte v2.0 » était sa dernière ligne.
  L'obligation est réelle et elle est tenue là où c'est fait pour : le crédit
  d'attribution de `dataCredits.js`, affiché tant que la couche est allumée, et
  la ligne `source` de la couche. Une fiche qu'on ouvre pour savoir ce qui
  dessert sa rue n'est pas une surface d'attribution.

- **La clé du trafic routier passe à deux étages, et cesse de se contredire :
  23 lignes et 559 mots deviennent 20 et 207.** Une seule ligne du panneau —
  « Trafic routier », dont le bouton porte quatre couches — imprimait TROIS
  blocs titrés au même corps, dans la même couleur, tous terminés par le même
  mot, pour 1 256 px de contenu dans une fenêtre de 216. Rien ne disait que les
  trois étaient une ligne, ni qu'ils répondaient à trois questions
  différentes. Mesuré en Île-de-France à 1440×900.

  **Les phrases mentaient, et elles mentaient par construction.** Chaque ligne
  de rythme imprimait deux comptes pour la même chose : celui de la ligne,
  calculé, et celui de la phrase, tapé à la main. `Pointe du soir 358` portait
  « 652 arcs — la classe la plus nombreuse » avec `Continu 614` deux lignes
  plus haut. Le pack de comptages est glissant, donc les sept tallies dérivaient
  chaque lundi. Elles sont remplacées par la COUPURE, dérivée des seuils gelés
  et écrite en inégalité : `06–09 h et 16–19 h ≥ 1,2 × le creux 10–15 h`. Un
  test refuse désormais tout chiffre qui ne soit pas l'un de ces seuils.

  **Une couleur ne dit plus deux choses.** `traffic` et `road-status-fr`
  peignaient la congestion avec les mêmes trois hexadécimaux et deux
  vocabulaires : `● Circulation fluide` au-dessus de `● Fluide`, même vert,
  co-observé à Rouen. Les deux lisent maintenant leurs mots dans une échelle
  partagée — Fluide · Ralenti · Bloqué · Impraticable — et chacune publie sa
  propre coupure, parce que les deux discrétisations ne sont pas la même.

  **Chaque bloc déclare son horloge.** Quatre couches, quatre horloges : TomTom
  à 60 s, les DIR à 60–360 s, Bison Futé toutes les 5 min, et une SEMAINE TYPE
  ARCHIVÉE que rien ne distinguait du direct. Une phrase par bloc, à la place
  des phrases par ligne — dont cinq, sur l'état du réseau, étaient en anglais.

  **L'échelle des cinq bandes de comptage devient une ligne**, comme la règle
  graduée des bouées avant elle : l'ordre se lit sur les traits, et le compte
  exact est sur la fiche.

  La sous-division s'applique à toute ligne fusionnée dont deux membres publient
  une clé — neuf des quinze. Une ligne à un seul membre garde exactement son
  rendu d'avant : un chrome qui ne lève aucune ambiguïté coûte des pixels pour
  rien.

- **Un événement routier n'est plus une couleur, c'est un dessin.** Huit
  teintes de catégorie se battaient avec tout ce qui se dessine sur la même
  chaussée : `obstacle` violet à ΔE 7,3 du rythme pendulaire, `intempérie` cyan
  à 9,2 de la pointe du matin, `déviation` vert à 12,6 du `Fluide` de
  l'échelle, et `accident` à ΔE 0,0 de la `Route fermée` de TomTom — le même
  hexadécimal, co-observé dans une clé à un instant. La catégorie est une
  variable NOMINALE : elle part sur la forme, comme le veut la sémiologie, et
  rend tout le canal teinte à la congestion, seule variable ordonnée du sujet.
  Neuf pictogrammes Material Symbols, vendorés verbatim, une encre unique, et
  la pastille de la clé EST la marque de la carte.

  **La gravité quitte la marque, et c'est une mesure.** Le diamètre composait
  trois variables — gravité, indicateur sécurité, état programmé — en vingt
  combinaisons entassées entre 5,6 et 15,4 px, dont quatorze paires voisines à
  moins de 0,75 px et quatre à 0,12 px : une fermeture majeure PROGRAMMÉE et
  une restriction moyenne EN COURS tombaient au même diamètre, et la clé n'en
  disait pas un mot. Sur le flux national du 2026-09-10, 312 des 386 situations
  sont `medium` — qui est aussi la valeur de repli quand personne ne déclare
  rien. La gravité est sur la fiche, en toutes lettres ; elle continue de
  moduler l'épaisseur d'un SEGMENT, où trois largeurs se lisent.

### Added
- **Chaque filière de centrale porte sa silhouette, et le lecteur choisit
  celle qu'il regarde — puis, seulement alors, la catégorie qu'il veut
  dedans.** La couche Centrales EDF dessinait 79 sites en disques que seule la
  TEINTE distinguait, et sur une vue de France entière la majorité d'entre eux
  n'avaient que ça : le libellé qui nomme un site en toutes lettres est plafonné
  à 60 marques sur 79 et tombe à la collision, donc la clé était de l'autre côté
  de l'écran et il fallait y porter une couleur à l'œil.

  **Trois formes, empruntées et pas dessinées, DÉCOUPÉES DANS UNE PASTILLE.**
  Une tour de refroidissement frappée du trèfle pour le nucléaire (Temaki,
  CC0 — c'est l'icône que les rendus OpenStreetMap emploient pour
  `plant:source=nuclear`), une goutte pour l'hydraulique et une flamme pour le
  thermique à flamme (Material Symbols, Apache-2.0). Le trèfle est un symbole
  CARTOGRAPHIQUE ici et pas un avis de danger : une tour nue, c'est aussi ce
  qu'a une centrale à charbon, et les deux sont sur le même écran à cent
  kilomètres l'une de l'autre.

  La pastille n'est pas un habillage : c'est le constat que la #160 a mesuré
  sur trois recadrages d'une vraie capture de Gironde — forêt, urbain, eau. Une
  silhouette nue posée sur une orthophoto est introuvable sous 18 px, et une
  pastille reste une pastille à 10. Le plancher de cette couche est à 13 px, sa
  plus petite centrale (Grandval, 74 MW) dessine à 15,6, et plus de la moitié
  de la flotte hydraulique tient sous 18 : une goutte d'encre sur la photo
  d'une vallée est une goutte d'eau sur une photo d'eau. La marque est donc un
  disque teinté cerclé de noir, la forme y est DÉCOUPÉE au `<mask>` SVG, et le
  trèfle — qui s'enroule à l'envers de la tour — revient dans la couleur du
  disque à l'intérieur de la tour sombre. Même géométrie de disque et même
  cerne que les Sites militaires : deux jeux de marques de LIEU qui
  différeraient d'un pixel de bord se liraient comme deux moteurs de rendu.

  **Le barrage a été écarté, et pour une raison d'exactitude.** L'en-tête de
  la couche consacre un paragraphe à refuser de confondre un barrage avec
  l'usine qu'il alimente — 37 de ses 51 centrales hydrauliques ont un sommet de
  barrage cartographié à moins de 3 km — et le dépôt dessine ces ouvrages dans
  leur propre couche. Une marque qui montrerait un barrage affirmerait ce que
  ce paragraphe nie. Une goutte dit l'eau, ce qui est tout ce que le nom de la
  filière revendique.

  **L'aire porte toujours les mégawatts.** Le côté de la marque suit la racine
  carrée de la puissance installée, comme le rayon du disque avant lui. Le
  plancher est passé de 7 à 13 px et le plafond de 26 à 34, parce qu'une
  silhouette de 7 px est une bavure : la loi devient `13 + 0,3·√MW`, et la
  saturation reste juste sous Gravelines — les deux plus gros sites de France
  (Gravelines 5 460 MW, Paluel 5 320 MW) dessinent au plafond, exactement comme
  en disques. Effet de bord mesuré et consigné dans `docs/REPRESENTATION.md` :
  le facteur 2,1 en aire entre cette couche et « Petite hydro » à 900 MW
  disparaît — 22,0 px contre 22 — mais c'est une coïncidence entre deux
  planchers, pas une échelle partagée, et le constat ① de cette page tient.

  **La clé porte les deux canaux sur une seule ligne.** La pastille du panneau
  est MASQUÉE par le raster que dessine le globe, donc elle EST la marque à la
  taille de la clé — au cerne près, retiré là parce qu'un masque CSS ne lit que
  l'alpha et qu'un cerne opaque écraserait les trois filières en un même point.
  La filière est nommée une fois, avec sa couleur et sa forme, plutôt que sur
  deux listes. C'est l'arrangement des Sites militaires,
  et la règle « la couleur oui, la forme non » (PR #138) interdit la seconde
  liste, pas cette ligne-là.

  **Le filtre a DEUX niveaux, et le second attend.** La bande de la ligne porte
  `TOUTES` et les trois filières. Les sous-catégories d'une filière — les
  paliers sous le nucléaire, les régimes d'eau sous l'hydraulique, les
  combustibles sous le thermique — n'apparaissent qu'une fois cette filière
  choisie. Les treize types publiés sous les trois filières, tous affichés à
  la fois, c'est seize boutons sur une ligne haute de quatre lignes avant que
  le lecteur ait posé la moindre question, avec « MARÉMOTRICE » (un site) à
  côté de « NUCLÉAIRE » (dix-huit).

  **Radio aux deux niveaux, et un second clic éteint.** La question à laquelle
  ce contrôle répond est « montre-moi le nucléaire » : un clic sur une radio,
  trois sur un jeu d'interrupteurs. Chaque bouton s'éteint au second clic, donc
  il y a toujours une sortie sans avoir à trouver la remise à zéro — et
  `TOUTES` reste sur la bande, allumée, pour que l'état non filtré se lise au
  lieu de se déduire de quatre boutons éteints.

  **Les sous-catégories sont DÉRIVÉES des sites dessinés**, jamais d'une liste
  écrite à la main : un bouton ne peut pas proposer une catégorie vide, une
  valeur qu'EDF publierait demain obtient son bouton sans changement de code,
  et un code que ce build n'a jamais vu s'affiche tel qu'EDF l'a écrit plutôt
  que d'être deviné. Une filière qui n'en publie qu'une seule n'en propose
  aucune : un bouton qui ne peut que resélectionner ce qui est déjà à l'écran
  coûterait quand même une ligne de panneau. Et un filtre qui pointerait sur
  une catégorie qu'une republication a supprimée se relâche d'un cran au lieu
  de laisser un globe vide sous un bouton allumé.

  **Rien n'est jeté, rien n'est refetché, rien n'est partagé.** Le registre
  entier reste derrière le filtre, donc revenir à la France entière ne coûte
  aucune requête ; `getStats()` continue de publier les totaux nationaux à côté
  de ce qui est dessiné, et nomme ce qu'il cache. Le filtre n'entre PAS dans un
  lien de partage : `edf-power-plants` reste `enabled-only` pour la raison que
  `layerState.js` consigne sous `meteo-stations-fr` — le filtre d'un auteur
  cacherait 77 % de la flotte française à son destinataire sans que celui-ci
  puisse le savoir. La vue d'un auteur n'est pas un fait sur la France.

  Couvert par 49 tests unitaires sur la couche et 14 sur le pack d'icônes ;
  `npm run qa:edf-plants` prouve dans un vrai Cesium que le filtre atteint le
  globe (les marques ET les libellés partent, la clé suit, la bande change de
  forme, et aucune requête n'est rejouée). Attribution mise à jour dans
  `licenses/temaki/NOTICE` et `licenses/material-symbols/NOTICE`.
- **Les sites militaires se voient enfin, et ils se voient de loin.** Sur une
  capture de la Gironde à 55 km, la couche dessinait quarante pastilles de
  **9 px** de la même valeur que les champs derrière elles : présentes dans le
  DOM, absentes de l'image. Deux causes, corrigées ensemble.

  **La marque.** Chaque classe portait une silhouette nue posée sur la photo —
  le traitement des véhicules, qui sont des objets qu'on suit. Un site est un
  LIEU sur une photographie de lieux, et il se dispute les mêmes pixels que les
  toits et les routes. La marque est donc devenue ce que les quatre packs
  locaux dessinent déjà pour un site au sol : une **pastille** teintée, cerclée
  de noir, avec la silhouette de la classe **découpée dedans**. Mesuré sur trois
  fonds réels — forêt, urbain, eau — la silhouette nue devient introuvable sous
  18 px ; une pastille reste une pastille à 10.

  **Les silhouettes elles-mêmes sont des icônes cartographiques libres**, pas
  des glyphes d'interface : le chasseur `fighter_jet` de Temaki pour une base
  aérienne, l'ancre `harbor` de Maki pour une base navale — CC0 toutes les
  deux, vendorisées dans `mapIcons.js`, une seule copie de chaque tracé dans le
  dépôt. Elles remplacent un avion de ligne et un ferry empruntés au pack des
  transports, qui disaient « aviation » et « bateau » là où le tag OSM dit
  « base aérienne » et « arsenal ».

  **La taille.** 28 px au nominal, 24 pour le fourre-tout, et surtout un plancher
  de rampe à 0,62 atteint à 140 km au lieu de 0,5 atteint à 60 : la même vue de
  la Gironde dessine 19 à 24 px, la plus large que la couche charge encore 17.

  **Et la portée.** La couche demandait sa vue à Overpass, plafonnée à 10°. Ce
  plafond n'a jamais été une politique de zoom : mesuré le 2026-09-10, une boîte
  de 1,5° répond en 4 s, 5° en 41 s, 7,5° en 50 s même sans géométrie, 10° en
  84 s — et une sonde navigateur a mesuré la couche **en échec** à 7,7°. La
  France entière est donc embarquée : **4 086 sites, 474 ko, 63 ko en brotli**,
  chargés au premier allumage de la couche et jamais autrement. Au-delà du
  plafond, la carte se dessine depuis ce pack, sans une seule requête ; en
  dessous, la requête vive reprend la main et **gagne toujours** sur le pack,
  avec ses emprises. « Zoomez pour charger » ne répond plus à quelqu'un qui
  recule au-dessus de son propre pays.

  **Ce que la clé dit maintenant** (A5) : combien de marques sur combien dans la
  vue, quel critère a décidé des sacrifiées — les classes nommées passent avant
  le fourre-tout, un site nommé avant un site sans nom — et que les marques
  venues du pack sont un relevé daté, sans emprise.

- **Deux puces coupent la couche Véhicules partagés en deux : les vélos, et
  tout le reste.** Une vue de ville tient des vélos, des VAE, des trottinettes,
  des scooters et des voitures partagées dans les mêmes rues, dessinés par la
  même couche. La silhouette disait déjà lequel est lequel ; il n'y avait rien
  pour AGIR dessus, et le lecteur venu pour l'un lisait les quatre autres comme
  du bruit.

  **C'est une PARTITION, pas deux ensembles qui se recouvrent.** Les six formes
  que GBFS nomme — `bike`, `ebike`, `scooter`, `moped`, `car`, `other` —
  tombent chacune d'un seul côté, et un test le vérifie forme par forme.
  Appuyer sur l'une puis sur l'autre montre donc toute la flotte, sans rien
  qui reste invisible sous les deux. C'est la propriété qui rend la paire
  fiable, et c'est pour ça qu'`other` — une forme que la spec refuse de nommer
  — est rangée avec le reste plutôt que nulle part.

  **Un VAE est un vélo.** `vehicleKindFromType()` sépare `bicycle` par
  propulsion : `bike` et `ebike` sont la même silhouette sur deux sources
  d'énergie. Une puce appelée « Vélos » qui aurait caché tous les Vélib'
  électriques aurait menti sur son propre nom ; l'infobulle dit que les deux
  sont dedans.

  **Une station est classée par ce qu'elle tient, et l'inventaire illisible est
  déclaré.** Un flux GBFS 2.x publie une répartition mécanique/électrique que
  le lecteur normalise, donc il répond directement. Un flux 3.0 publie
  `vehicle_types_available`, dont les clés sont les identifiants de types
  PROPRES au système — des chaînes opaques que cette couche ne sait pas
  résoudre. Ces stations-là, comme celles qui ne publient aucune répartition,
  retombent sur le défaut de la spec elle-même : un système sans types de
  véhicules « est réputé exploiter des vélos non motorisés ». 117 des 135
  systèmes français distincts dessinent des stations (index du 2026-08-27),
  donc la règle porte, et l'infobulle des vélos l'annonce plutôt que de la
  laisser deviner.

  **Pas de troisième puce pour dire « tout ».** La puce allumée EST le retour,
  et elle le publie comme une valeur (`kinds: 'all'`) et non comme « appuyez
  deux fois » : un paramètre qui s'inverserait à chaque application se serait
  éteint tout seul le jour où quelque chose le rejoue — le tampon du stub
  paresseux, une intention de paramètres réappliquée à l'allumage — et rien de
  tout ça n'aurait ressemblé à un bug vu de l'extérieur. La bande est
  d'ailleurs partagée avec les puces de fusion « Longue traîne FR » et
  « Semaine type » : une quatrième aurait dépensé un quart d'un ruban de
  commandes à dire non.

  **Le filtre passe AVANT le plafond de 6 000 objets, et il compte ce qu'il
  cache.** Dépenser le budget de rendu sur des véhicules qu'on vient de
  demander à cacher aurait fait dire à la puce « dessine moins de vélos » au
  lieu de « ne dessine que les vélos ». Chaque infobulle porte les deux
  moitiés — mesuré en direct au-dessus de Paris le 2026-09-10, sur une réponse
  plafonnée à 6 000 objets : **5 091 d'un côté, 909 de l'autre**, et la ligne
  de la couche passe de `6 operators · capped` à `6 operators · bikes only ·
  capped`. La réponse du proxy est gardée entière, donc changer de filtre ne
  coûte aucune requête, et une puce dont la moitié est vide est refusée au lieu
  de vider le globe. Enfin, quand un filtre cache tout ce qui est en vue, la
  ligne le dit (`no bikes in this view — the rest is filtered out`) : « no
  vehicles reporting here » aurait accusé le flux de ce que le lecteur venait
  de faire.

- **Les cinq marchés voisins sont délimités, et jamais remplis.** Jusqu'ici
  l'Espagne n'existait nulle part sur le globe : une flèche sortait du cadre et
  le lecteur fournissait le pays de mémoire. Les contours de la Grande-Bretagne,
  de l'Espagne péninsulaire, de l'Italie, de la Suisse et du couple
  Allemagne + Belgique sont désormais tracés — Natural Earth 1:50m, domaine
  public, 674 points pour les cinq.

  **Un trait, jamais un aplat**, et c'est la même règle que partout ailleurs
  dans cette couche : un polygone rempli, ici, c'est à quoi ressemble une
  MESURE, et rien n'a été mesuré à l'intérieur de l'Espagne. Trois marques,
  trois affirmations : prisme rempli = mesuré, et voilà combien ; emprise à
  plat hachurée = connu, non publié (la Corse) ; contour vide = c'est la
  contrepartie, et c'est tout ce qu'on en sait. Le contour prend la couleur du
  flux, et il reste dessiné en ardoise quand le flux tombe à zéro — un arc est
  une direction et une direction de rien n'est rien, tandis que « qui est en
  face » reste vrai à zéro.

  Deux limites de périmètre voyagent avec le fichier : le contour espagnol est
  le **marché péninsulaire**, donc sans les Baléares ni les Canaries, et le
  britannique est la **zone d'ajustement GB**, donc sans l'Irlande du Nord.
  L'Allemagne et la Belgique partagent un contour parce qu'elles partagent un
  champ.

### Changed
- **Le mix électrique cesse de dessiner 96 départements pour 12 mesures.**
  La couche mesure douze régions ; elle en dessinait quatre-vingt-seize. Le
  premier lecteur venu l'a lu exactement comme ça se dessinait — « chaque
  département a une hauteur qui est représentative du niveau de puissance qu'il
  exporte […] on n'arrive pas à distinguer un département par rapport à un
  autre » — c'est-à-dire une lecture de mesures DÉPARTEMENTALES sur une carte
  où aucun département n'est mesuré, suivie du constat qu'ils se ressemblent
  tous. Ils se ressemblaient parce qu'ils sont identiques : huit prismes à la
  même altitude pour une seule mesure francilienne.

  Les départements sont désormais **fusionnés topologiquement** en un contour
  par région avant tout tracé. Treize marques au lieu de quatre-vingt-seize —
  douze prismes et la Corse — et les coutures ont disparu avec les frontières
  intérieures : mesuré sur le fichier livré, 96 polygones, 118 anneaux et
  14 335 sommets deviennent 31 anneaux de 5 742 sommets, parce que 4 253
  segments partagés s'annulent, dont 139 pour la seule Île-de-France. La fusion
  n'est ni une bibliothèque ni une approximation : le fichier des départements
  est une subdivision planaire propre où chaque segment interne apparaît
  exactement deux fois, ce qu'un test vérifie sur les treize régions. Aucun
  département n'atteint plus la scène ni la moindre étiquette.

  **Le prisme ne tient plus toute la région, et la carte le dit.** Douze
  régions fusionnées pavent la France sans jeu : extrudées, elles se recollent
  en une seule mesa dès qu'on regarde de biais. Chaque prisme est donc posé sur
  l'emprise de sa région **réduite à 90 %** — une homothétie, pas un tampon
  intérieur, qui se recouperait dans le Cotentin et les vallées alpines — ce
  qui ouvre un canyon de 12 à 34 km entre voisines (recul moyen mesuré : 6,3 km
  pour l'Île-de-France, 17,2 km pour la Nouvelle-Aquitaine). La contrepartie est
  payée et non escamotée : le **périmètre exact** de chaque région est tracé au
  sol, sous son prisme, de la même couleur, et la légende énonce les deux. Les
  îles trop petites pour porter un volume (Ré, Oléron, Belle-Île, Noirmoutier,
  Yeu, Porquerolles) gardent ce trait et perdent le prisme : une colonne de
  78 km sur 23 km² mesure sa région et a l'air de mesurer l'île.

- **Les cinq flèches d'échange partent de la frontière, plus du centre du
  pays.** Toutes partaient du même point au milieu du Berry, ce qui dessinait
  un pays qui commerce depuis son centre de gravité. Chaque arc quitte
  maintenant le point de la frontière française **le plus proche du point de
  référence de son marché**, calculé sur la même géométrie fusionnée, la Corse
  étant exclue de la recherche pour que l'arc italien parte des Alpes et non de
  Bonifacio : Angleterre 1,58 E / 50,87 N, Espagne 1,44 O / 43,05 N, Italie
  7,71 E / 44,07 N, Suisse 7,42 E / 47,45 N, Allemagne + Belgique 6,47 E /
  49,46 N. Que ces cinq points tombent près d'interconnexions réelles est une
  **conséquence, pas une affirmation** : `ech_comm_*` est un solde commercial
  entre deux zones de marché et ne porte aucun tracé.

- **Et la flèche devient un volume : elle était « quasi illisible ».** Les arcs
  frontaliers étaient un trait effilé de 3 à 10 PIXELS D'ÉCRAN. Pour 366 MW
  venus d'Espagne, cela faisait 3,85 px, à côté d'un prisme de 78 km. Une
  largeur d'écran se bat d'ailleurs contre le reste de la couche, qui mesure en
  mètres : en zoomant, chaque prisme grandissait et le flux restait un cheveu.

  Le fût est désormais un **tube de rayon terrestre**, 9 à 22 km, calé sur
  |MW| et saturé aux mêmes 3 000 MW. Mesuré à l'altitude des captures
  (1 300 km, ≈1,21 km par pixel) : 366 MW font 21 km de large, soit **17 px**
  au lieu de 3,85 ; un flux saturé fait 44 km, **36 px** ; et sa pointe 84 km,
  **69 px**. Corps translucide et arête vive, comme les prismes — c'est la
  forme demandée. La section est un polygone régulier et non un ruban : Cesium
  balaie la section sur un repère de Frenet, donc une bande plate se couche à
  l'horizontale et disparaît dès que la caméra passe à l'oblique.

  **Le sens se lit à la pointe** : un cône presque opaque de 1,9 fois le rayon
  du fût, là où le fût ne l'est pas — l'extrémité la plus vive est celle où le
  courant arrive. Le fût s'arrête une longueur de pointe avant, sinon le cône
  est avalé par le volume qu'il termine, et l'ensemble est soulevé de
  1,25 rayon au-dessus du sol : un cintre sinusoïdal vaut zéro aux deux bouts
  et enterrait la moitié basse du tube exactement là où le lecteur regarde.

  **Et la longueur a cessé d'être une variable.** Accrochée au point de
  référence du marché, elle valait 94 km vers la Suisse contre 411 vers
  l'Italie : un rapport de 4 pour 1 que l'œil lit, que la donnée n'a jamais
  écrit, et qui noyait l'épaisseur qui, elle, dit tout. Le point lointain est
  maintenant un CAP et non une destination — le glyphe court sur
  `clamp(corde, 170 km, 340 km)` vers son marché, et chacun des cinq finit
  toujours À L'INTÉRIEUR du marché qu'il nomme, vérifié contre les contours
  livrés. Le cintre, lui, ne mesure rien, et la légende le dit.

### Fixed
- **Arriver quelque part ne suffisait pas : onze couches continuaient de décrire
  la ville qu'on venait de quitter.** Le correctif du 2026-09-10 sur les
  transports en commun (#151) avait nommé ce trou sans le boucher ailleurs — il
  était dans TOUTES les couches par vue, et une seule avait été réparée. Voici
  les autres : bornes de recharge, véhicules partagés, vélos en libre-service,
  services publics, écoles, petite enfance, servitudes, antennes ANFR,
  délinquance, bouées marines et trafic routier.

  **La cause, la même partout.** Une couche par vue se rafraîchit sur
  `camera.changed`. Cet événement ne se déclenche que tant que le mouvement
  accumulé dépasse le seuil partagé de 5 %, et la décélération d'un vol adouci
  passe sous ce seuil bien AVANT l'arrivée : mesuré sur une navigation vocale
  Paris → Rouen, dernier `changed` à **t = 2,5 s**, `camera.moveEnd` à
  **t = 3,3 s**. Le seul chargement qu'un vol déclenche est donc émis pour une
  caméra ENCORE EN MOUVEMENT, et rien ne relisait la vue sur laquelle elle
  s'arrête. Ce verdict de mi-vol tenait jusqu'au sondage suivant de la couche :
  quinze secondes pour un flux vivant, **six HEURES** pour les registres. Une
  couche pouvait ainsi afficher « zoomez pour charger » à quelqu'un déjà posé
  sur une ville, ou INDISPONIBLE avec l'explication de la ville qu'on venait de
  quitter — et le seul remède était de l'éteindre puis de la rallumer.

  **Mesuré des deux côtés**, même sonde et deux serveurs voisins, caméra posée
  sans que `camera.changed` ne se déclenche une seule fois : sur l'arbre
  d'avant, `irve-fr`, `schools-fr`, `amenities-fr` et `anfr-fr` émettent
  **zéro** requête après l'arrêt de la caméra ; après, chacune va chercher la
  vue d'arrivée.

  **Les deux événements, jamais un seul.** `moveEnd` n'arrive pas toujours (vol
  annulé, viewer démonté en vol, scène qui cesse de peindre), et `changed` ne
  parle jamais de la pose finale ; ils se couvrent l'un l'autre.

  **Et un déplacement ordinaire ne coûte toujours rien.** `moveEnd` se
  déclenche à la fin de CHAQUE geste : une couche qui rechargerait à chacun
  serait la carte qui recharge sans fin. Chaque couche marque la vue qu'elle
  lit, et un repos sur cette même vue ne demande rien — vérifié couche par
  couche dans le navigateur, quatre repos sous la précision de comparaison
  n'émettent aucune requête, sur les onze.

- **Les arrêts d'Île-de-France cessaient d'être des points fixes, et leur clé se
  répétait.** Deux des quatre remarques d'un lecteur sur la couche « Transports
  en commun ». Les deux autres — la marque grise sur gris, et le clic sans
  réponse — sont réglées par la #162.

  **« Il me semblait que c'étaient des points géographiques fixes. »** Ils
  l'étaient — c'est le dessin qui ne l'était pas, et le défaut n'était pas
  local à cette couche. Les marques étaient posées sur l'**ellipsoïde, à la
  hauteur 0**, alors que le maillage photoréaliste lit **83 à 92 m** aux mêmes
  coordonnées : quatre-vingt-dix mètres sous leur propre trottoir. Le test de
  profondeur étant désactivé, elles étaient peintes quand même, et leur
  position à l'écran devenait une fonction de la **pose de la caméra**. Mesuré
  au Quartier latin, caméra au nadir à 420 m, canevas 1400 × 900 : **140 px**
  d'écart médian, **272 px** au pire, et jusqu'à **269 px de glissement** sur un
  panoramique de 250 m. Après : **0,0 px** aux trois mesures.

  **La cause est générale.** Le mécanisme de calage lisait `globe.getHeight()`,
  et l'application masque le globe dès que la pile photoréaliste est active —
  c'est-à-dire par défaut. Un globe masqué ne charge aucune tuile : la fonction
  renvoyait `undefined` partout, et tout le calage ne faisait **rien**, en
  silence, sur la pile que la plupart des lecteurs regardent.
  `src/data/renderedSurface.js` sonde désormais la surface réellement dessinée,
  et il ration la sonde — `scene.sampleHeight` coûte **6,28 ms l'appel** : une
  sonde au centre de la boîte prêtée à toutes les marques (à elle seule, 88 m
  d'erreur ramenés à ~8 m), des sondes par marque plafonnées à 24 par passe et
  verrouillées une fois pour toutes, et un réessai qui **double son délai**
  (250 ms → 8 s, ~16 s d'horizon) parce qu'une première version à intervalle
  fixe expirait *avant* la fin du streaming des tuiles. `isochroneRings`, les
  cinq couches de scan d'adresse et les disques de fréquence — qui sont des
  `PointPrimitive` — sont corrigés au passage. La bande de plausibilité, le
  plafond de caméra et le test de drainage des tuiles sont **empruntés à
  `provisionalFloor.js`** et `meshFloorSampler.js`, qui possèdent déjà cette
  question ; ce qui n'est pas partagé, c'est le GRAIN — une cellule de ~111 m
  sondée en son centre est la bonne maille pour un front de feu et la mauvaise
  pour un arrêt, où elle tombe sur un toit haussmannien aussi volontiers que
  sur le trottoir.

  **« Là, c'est du charabia. »** La clé répétait surtout ses propres étiquettes
  — `4 à 8/h — 7 à 15 min` portait dessous « Quatre à huit par heure : 7 à 15
  minutes. » Les étiquettes nomment maintenant ce sur quoi un lecteur décide :
  **« un passage toutes les 4 à 7 min »**. Les six paraphrases ont disparu ; il
  reste une phrase, sur le seul état qu'une couleur ne peut pas dire — le
  silence, dont la ligne voisine est justement « non mesuré ». Et les **549
  arrêts sans coordonnée sortent de la colonne des comptes** : posée sous des
  lignes comptant ce qui est à l'écran, avec sa pastille, elle se lisait
  exactement à l'envers. C'est le contraire — ce sont les seuls arrêts qu'on
  **ne peut pas** placer, 549 sur 36 502, soit **1,50 %**. Elle est désormais
  une note sans pastille, son nombre est dans la phrase, et il est lu au bon
  endroit : le produit régional et non la boîte à l'écran, dont le champ
  homonyme compte autre chose et répond 0 partout — ce qui rendait la note tout
  simplement inatteignable.

  **La fiche passe de onze lignes à sept**, et commence par la conséquence :
  `Un bus toutes les 2 min 30 — ce jeudi à 17 h`, puis le débit qui le prouve,
  puis le seul jour qui **diffère** à la même heure. Trois lignes sont tombées :
  un total quotidien en « courses » (qui mesure la taille de l'arrêt, pas la
  journée du lecteur) ; une rangée de sept nombres sans question posée,
  généralisée plutôt que câblée sur le week-end, parce que le plus grand écart
  de ce jeu n'est pas le samedi mais le **vendredi soir, +98,6 % sur la tranche
  01 h** ; et un décompte de tranches publiées, dont la part utile est déjà
  « premier 06 h 00, dernier 00 h 00 ». Le mode monte sur le titre, à côté du
  nom, où un lecteur cherche ce qu'il vient de cliquer.

- **Le comptage parisien cessait de s'inviter à Tokyo.** `comptages-fr` dessine
  2 946 arcs de rue parisiens et rien d'autre sur Terre — sa boîte entière fait
  **12,6 km sur 10,0**. C'était un compagnon de la rangée « Trafic routier »
  sans `optIn`, donc allumer le trafic au-dessus de Tokyo l'allumait aussi,
  téléchargeait son morceau de bundle, et versait ses **sept puces de créneau**
  (`Moyenne ouvrée` … `W-E 18 h`) dans une bande qui en comptait **quinze**.
  Sept contrôles sur quinze, sur chaque vue de la planète, pilotant une couche
  sans charge utile.

  **La réparation n'est pas de cacher le contrôle.** Une puce qui n'existe
  qu'au-dessus de Paris est une puce dont personne n'apprend l'existence :
  il faudrait déjà savoir qu'elle est là pour aller la chercher. La règle est
  donc DÉCLARER, JAMAIS CACHER. La puce s'appelle `Comptages · Paris`, elle ne
  suit plus le bouton ON de la rangée, et hors couverture elle est **grisée en
  pointillés — jamais désactivée** : un bouton désactivé ne peut pas être
  cliqué, et le clic est précisément la façon de demander à être emmené là où
  sont les données. Le pointillé plutôt qu'une teinte, parce que les préréglages
  NVG et FLIR jettent la teinte. Les sept options de créneau, elles,
  disparaissent hors couverture — une option n'est pas une déclaration.

  **`layerCoverage.js` est la table des territoires**, et ses trois états ne
  disent pas la même chose : `in`, `out`, et `dark` — dedans, mais dans un trou
  documenté. `road-status-fr` est national et **noir au-dessus de Paris** parce
  que la DIRIF ne publie ni station ni état ; ce n'est pas « hors couverture »,
  c'est « couvert et vide, et voici qui ne publie pas ». Sur la rangée trafic
  les deux se lisent donc en opposition : au-dessus de Paris exactement un des
  deux contrôles a des données, et ce n'est pas celui dont le nom dit
  « réseau ». Cinq autres couches à territoire restreint y ont une ligne.

  **Une carte de trois lignes avant le premier allumage**, et seulement si la
  caméra est hors du territoire — le lecteur déjà au-dessus de Paris qui presse
  la puce en connaissance de cause ne la rencontre jamais. Elle dit ce que le
  comptage est, ce qu'il n'est pas (« ce n'est pas de la congestion »), et
  qu'il s'arrête au périphérique ; puis elle propose le vol. « Ne plus demander
  — aller directement » nomme sa conséquence au moment du consentement.

  **Au passage, une pastille qui mentait.** `fraicheur-fr`, ce sont 25 045
  arbres parisiens et 159 fontaines, et sa pastille de portée disait `FR` — ce
  qui promet à un lecteur bordelais quelque chose que personne n'a construit.
  Elle dit `PARIS`, et elle s'éteint quand la caméra est ailleurs.

  Mesuré au-dessus de Tokyo : la bande passe de **15 à 8 puces**. Vérifié dans
  un vrai navigateur par `npm run qa:layer-coverage` — 26 contrôles, dont le
  vol, le retour des sept créneaux à l'arrivée, et la réciproque Paris/province
  sur une seule bande.

- **Un vol vers une couche, dans un onglet en arrière-plan, laissait le panneau
  en arrière.** `_refreshTogglePanel` décline pendant que le document est caché
  et défère à la passe de `visibilitychange` ; le suivi de couverture
  enregistrait pourtant sa signature sur cette passe déclinée, et l'appel
  suivant croyait n'avoir rien à faire. Un lecteur qui volait de Tokyo à Paris
  en arrière-plan retrouvait une bande encore composée pour Tokyo, sans plus
  aucun événement capable de la corriger. La méthode répond désormais si elle a
  peint.
- **Une région que le flux n'a pas publiée disparaissait sans que rien ne le
  dise.** éCO2mix publie région par région, et une région qui n'a pas émis dans
  la fenêtre n'est tout simplement pas dans la réponse. Le 2026-09-10 à 15:04Z,
  c'était la Normandie : la carte dessinait douze prismes et **deux** emprises
  hachurées, et la légende annonçait « non publié 1 ». 11 + 1 ne fait pas 13, et
  il a fallu que le lecteur le remarque à l'œil.

  Tous les compteurs de la couche partaient des LIGNES REÇUES, or une région
  absente n'a pas de ligne. Ils partent maintenant des **treize régions
  connues**, ce qui range les trois causes d'absence — la Corse, jamais
  publiée ; une valeur nulle ; une région tombée du flux — sous un seul compte,
  exactement comme elles partagent une seule marque. Et l'emprise hachurée
  porte désormais son **nom** sur le globe : « Normandie · SOLDE NON PUBLIÉ ».
  Une forme grise anonyme, c'est ce qui obligeait à identifier la région
  manquante en suivant le littoral.

- **L'URL de recette ne peut plus être en retard sur `main`.** Le 2026-09-10 à
  15 h 25, `gev.enerlens.com` servait une branche coupée à la #152 : la #153
  (bus de Normandie projetés sur leur ligne) et la #154 (silhouettes des sites
  militaires) étaient fusionnées depuis 31 et 16 minutes et **invisibles**,
  pendant que la machine annonçait un conteneur sain, reconstruit trois minutes
  plus tôt. Rien n'était cassé : l'agent avait déployé exactement ce qu'on lui
  demandait — « la PR ouverte la plus récente », une consigne qui ne dit rien du
  travail fusionné.

  **La règle est maintenant une inclusion, pas une préférence.** Ce qui est
  servi CONTIENT `main` : un aperçu, c'est `main` plus une PR, jamais `main`
  moins une fusion. `auto` mesure donc la candidate avant de la montrer — il
  demande à GitHub combien de commits de `main` lui manquent
  (`/compare/<main>...<tête>`, `behind_by`) et, si la réponse n'est pas zéro,
  montre `main`. **Pour mettre une branche sur l'URL, il faut la rebaser** ;
  c'est la seule obligation nouvelle, et la CI la réclame déjà.

  **Ne pas savoir, c'est montrer `main`.** Quota épuisé, panne d'API, PR ouverte
  depuis un fork dont la branche n'existe pas ici : dans les trois cas la
  réponse est `main`, parce que c'est la seule référence à laquelle il ne peut
  manquer aucun travail fusionné. Une épingle explicite (`echo ma-branche >
  /opt/gev/target`) reste souveraine — c'est une décision, pas un accident —
  mais une épingle périmée le DIT désormais, dans le journal et dans
  `state/selection`, au lieu de se découvrir des heures plus tard.

  **Et ça ne coûte pas un appel de plus toutes les trois minutes.** Le verdict
  est mis en cache sur le couple de shas exact qui l'a produit : une poussée =
  un appel, contre vingt par heure sur le quota anonyme de 60/h que cette IP
  partage avec ses voisins. Une seule ligne répond à « pourquoi est-ce que je
  regarde ça ? » : `cat /opt/gev/state/selection`. Neuf tests exécutent le vrai
  script contre un GitHub factice et tiennent chaque branche de la décision.

- **Les centrales électriques étaient dessinées en parasols : la moitié basse
  de chaque disque était mangée par le sol.** Une pastille Cesium porte UNE
  profondeur pour tout son carré — celle de la coordonnée du site — donc dès
  que le test de profondeur est actif, elle est comparée au terrain sous
  chacun de ses pixels. Vue autrement que droit du dessus, le sol situé sous
  le point à l'écran est PLUS PRÈS de la caméra que le point lui-même : il
  gagne le test et efface la moitié inférieure du disque, pendant que la
  moitié haute survit. Le résultat n'est pas un marqueur à moitié caché, c'est
  un SYMBOLE DIFFÉRENT — un dôme à fond plat, sur chaque site, à toute hauteur
  de caméra au-dessus du seuil de 5 000 m qui était réglé là.

  Reproduit dans l'application au-dessus de **Gravelines**, caméra à 6 km et
  35° de tangage : le disque de 5 460 MW peint une calotte qui s'arrête net à
  son ancrage. Après correctif, le profil ligne par ligne du même disque est
  symétrique — 26 px au plus large, dégradé des deux côtés. Les anneaux de la
  couche *Groupes de prod* étaient déjà entiers dans la même image, parce
  qu'ils demandaient déjà `Number.POSITIVE_INFINITY` ; c'est ce qui rendait
  l'écart visible sans le rendre lisible.

  Corrigé sur les **79 sites EDF** et sur la **petite hydro** — les centrales
  comme les anneaux de commune. Le prix de peindre par-dessus le terrain,
  c'est qu'un site de l'autre côté de la planète peindrait à travers le globe :
  chaque couche passe donc un rideau d'horizon par image, comme le fait déjà
  `rteGeneration.js`. Les deux harnais le prouvent en plaçant la caméra à
  l'antipode et en vérifiant que tout disparaît, puis revient.

  **Au passage, le compteur de pixels du harnais RTE ne lisait rien du tout.**
  Le viewer tourne en `preserveDrawingBuffer: false` : le tampon WebGL est
  vidé dès qu'une image est présentée, donc un `drawImage` du canvas depuis
  son propre `page.evaluate` renvoie **960 000 pixels noirs**. Le contrôle
  annonçait `0 → 0` pour Paluel à 1 161 MW — alors qu'une capture de la même
  image contient **235 pixels** de la couleur nucléaire — et son garde-fou
  voisin (« le fond de carte n'était pas déjà de cette couleur ») passait au
  vert POUR LA MÊME RAISON. Deux contrôles verts sur une lecture vide.
  `requestRender()`, `render()` et la lecture dans la même tâche JS, plus un
  contrôle qui vérifie d'abord qu'une image a été lue : `qa:rte-generation`
  passe de 37 ✓ / 4 ✗ à **42 ✓**.

- **Le texte des fiches de centrales était un code d'exploitant, et pour
  moitié de l'anglais.** Cliquer sur Le Blayais répondait `4 × REP 900`,
  `tranches couplées 1981-1983`, `40 MW de réserve secondaire` : trois champs
  publiés, rendus fidèlement, dont aucun ne dit quoi que ce soit à quelqu'un
  venu regarder une carte. Cliquer sur un groupe RTE répondait `69% of
  nameplate`, `3 of 4 groups reporting`, `drawing from the grid` — en anglais,
  sur des centrales françaises.

  Même traitement que les plans de bruit aérien : une table qui va du code à
  ce qu'il VEUT DIRE, consultée par la fiche, le chiffre du publieur laissé
  intact à côté. Les treize valeurs que publient les trois fichiers EDF sont
  couvertes, et la chaîne d'origine reste à un argument près
  (`plantKindText(site, { register: 'raw' })`).

      ◈ Centrale nucléaire · 4 réacteurs à eau pressurisée de 900 MW
      ⚡ 3 640 MW installés : le maximum du site, pas ce qu'il produit à cet instant
      ▸ combustible : MOX (uranium et plutonium recyclés) · uranium enrichi
      ↻ 40 MW tenus en réserve pour stabiliser le réseau en quelques minutes
      🕐 4 réacteurs raccordés au réseau entre 1981 et 1983
      ⌁ RTE : 1 680 MW — n'y compte que les 4 groupes de 100 MW et plus

  **La phrase qui manquait le plus est celle sur laquelle la couche entière
  repose** : un disque dimensionné à la puissance installée, au-dessus d'un
  site dont trois réacteurs sur six sont à l'arrêt, ressemble exactement à un
  site qui tourne à fond. La fiche le dit maintenant, à chaque fois.

  **Et `5,460 MW` se lisait « cinq et demi ».** `formatGenMw` groupait en
  `en-US` sur une interface française. Corrigé en `5 460 MW`, avec la virgule
  décimale pour les gigawatts, l'espace insécable avant `%`, et l'heure des
  mesures RTE en format français. Côté petite hydro, les points décimaux d'un
  dénivelé (`417.6 m de chute`) et des distances (`6.1 km`) partent avec, et
  `h équivalent pleine puissance` devient « % de ce qu'elle produirait sans
  jamais s'arrêter ».

  Ce que ça ne fait PAS : rien de ce que publient EDF, RTE ou ODRÉ n'est
  corrigé, arrondi autrement ou masqué. Les noms de départements et de régions
  restent tels que le registre les crie (`GIRONDE`, `AUVERGNE-RHONE-ALPES`,
  sans accents), parce que les recasser proprement demanderait de deviner des
  accents que le publieur n'a pas écrits.
- **Les véhicules partagés restent collés au sol quand on déplace la carte.**
  Même panne que les feux actifs la veille, sur une couche où elle se voyait
  bien plus souvent. Un objet était posé à la hauteur 0 — sur l'ellipsoïde
  WGS84, pas sur le sol — tant que sa cellule de MNT n'avait pas répondu sur le
  réseau. Mesuré dans l'application au-dessus de **Paris**, sur les flux réels,
  6 000 objets dessinés et 221 sondés : **tous à 2,500 m d'altitude
  ellipsoïdale**, c'est-à-dire le seul décalage de 2,5 m que la couche ajoute
  au-dessus d'un sol qu'elle croyait à zéro — donc **73 à 116 m sous la rue**.
  Après correctif, la même vue rend **75,1 à 118,6 m, et zéro objet sur
  l'ellipsoïde**, dès la première image où ils existent.

  Un point enterré n'est pas « un peu décalé » : le test de profondeur est
  désactivé pour qu'une trottinette ne soit pas avalée par le trottoir sur
  lequel elle est posée, donc il est peint quand même — et sa position à
  l'écran devient une fonction de la POSE DE LA CAMÉRA. On tire la carte à la
  souris et toute la flotte glisse sur les toits avant de se replacer. Sur une
  couche qui recharge à chaque mouvement de caméra, ça recommençait sur
  pratiquement chaque vue.

  **Et ici, ça ne se replaçait jamais.** Le préchauffage du MNT partait sans
  personne pour l'attendre, et une position est écrite une fois dans la
  primitive : rien ne repositionnait ce que le réseau finissait par résoudre.
  Mesuré : les 6 000 points de Paris sont restés à 2,500 m pendant les **vingt
  secondes** de la sonde, caméra à l'arrêt. Le harnais l'a reproduit à Nantes,
  sur son jeu figé : 32 objets, vingt-cinq relevés, pas un centimètre — et il
  garde maintenant le contrôle qui refuse ça (49,8 à 84,1 m après). La couche
  relit maintenant la surface qu'elle DESSINE avant de poser quoi que ce soit,
  puis **repasse** replacer ce qui a gagné un meilleur sol : cinq réveils qui
  doublent (~37 s en tout), rechargés dès que la caméra bouge, et jamais une
  requête de plus.

  **Le store provisoire n'est plus dans la couche des feux.** Une cellule de
  ~111 m de sol est le même sol quelle que soit la couche qui demande, donc les
  sondes payées par les feux sont lues gratuitement par les scooters garés dans
  la même rue : `fireAnchors.js` et `sharedMobilityFrance.js` partagent
  désormais `provisionalFloor.js`, avec la même politique de réveils. Ce qui
  reste propre à chaque appelant est un rayon : les feux empruntent un sol à
  25 km — un complexe tient sur un versant — les véhicules à 10 km, parce que
  la vue qui en contient un est une ville et qu'un sol emprunté doit rester
  dans la même cuvette.

### Added
- **Les sites militaires ne sont plus cinq nuances de pastille : chaque classe
  porte sa silhouette.** La couche venait de recevoir sa clé, mais la couleur
  restait le seul canal — cinq teintes sur des points identiques de 9 px, dont
  deux (`#5aa9ff` base aérienne, `#48c7d5` base navale) à un pas l'une de
  l'autre sur le même bleu. Un lecteur devait porter une nuance des yeux
  jusqu'au panneau pour nommer une marque : il faisait le travail de la clé.

  **Quatre marques, et rien de dessiné qui existait déjà.** L'avion et le
  navire sont les Material Symbols déjà vendorisés pour les modes `air` et
  `ferry` du transport, empruntés par la porte publique de leur module plutôt
  que recopiés. La cible du champ de tir et l'écusson du terrain militaire sont
  de la géométrie — des cercles, quatre lignes et deux courbes —, pas une œuvre
  à reconnaître.

  **Ce qui n'a PAS été repris, c'est le traitement.** Les couches de marqueurs
  d'adresse dessinent leurs corps au trait — 7 unités de contour dans une boîte
  de 96, à 14 ou 19 px — et à cette taille un filet se lit comme un caractère
  tapé sur la photo, pas comme une marque posée dessus. Tout ici est plein :
  une silhouette remplie, ou un anneau qui a une vraie largeur, sur un halo
  sombre large.

  **Le fourre-tout porte le signe le plus générique qui soit, et pèse moins.**
  `landuse=military` plus `barracks` et `base`, c'est neuf marques sur dix :
  son écusson dit « défense » et refuse de dire autre chose — ni véhicule, ni
  cible, ni activité. Il se dessine à 20 px quand les trois classes qui
  nomment un sujet tiennent 24 : la taille est ce qui reste pour dire « celle-ci
  en dit moins ». Une pastille nue le disait aussi, mais elle ne se distinguait
  pas d'une marque qui n'a pas fini de charger.

  **La clé montre la marque, pas une redite.** Le glyphe voyage DANS la ligne
  de couleur à laquelle il appartient — la pastille du panneau est la marque à
  la taille de la clé, construite par le même appel que le globe — donc aucune
  ligne de forme ne s'ajoute et une silhouette ne peut pas dériver entre la
  carte et sa légende. Vérifié en navigateur sur la rade de Toulon : 44 sites,
  39 écussons à 20 px, 3 navires et 2 cibles à 24, trois images distinctes,
  plus aucun point, et trois pastilles de clé masquées aux bonnes teintes.

- **La couche Sites militaires a enfin une clé : des couleurs qui ne disaient
  rien.** Le module peignait ses pastilles sur plusieurs teintes — base
  aérienne, base navale, champ de tir, terrain militaire — et n'implémentait
  `getRowControls()` nulle part, alors que 49 autres couches en publient un.
  Rien à l'écran ne décodait donc la couleur.

  **Le gris est le fourre-tout, et la légende l'annonce.** `landuse=military`,
  plus `military=barracks` et `military=base`, absorbe aussi les champs de
  manœuvre et les zones dangereuses, qui n'ont pas de classe propre. Mesuré le
  2026-09-10 sur quatre vues françaises : 39 des 44 objets de la rade de
  Toulon, 68 des 69 de l'ouest parisien. Sans cette phrase, un lecteur lit
  quatre classes de poids comparable là où il y en a une et trois raretés.

  **Aucune ligne de forme, et c'en est une décision.** Certains sites portent
  une emprise remplie, les autres une pastille nue — mesuré le 2026-09-10, 137
  objets sur 163, et la coupure suit exactement le type d'élément OSM. La ligne
  qui le disait est ressortie : la légende des aéroports avait les deux mêmes
  et les a perdues, sur la règle qu'une FORME se décode sans clé. Une seconde
  légende dans le même panneau n'y répond pas autrement.

  **Les comptes sont ceux du DESSIN, jamais du chargement.** La clé se construit
  dans `renderRecords`, à partir de la même cohorte que les entités — donc
  au-delà du plafond de 700, ou hors cadre après le filtre de vue, une ligne
  disparaît au lieu de revendiquer des sites absents de l'écran. Vérifié en
  navigateur sur la rade de Toulon : 44 sites dessinés, trois lignes — base
  navale 3, champ de tir 2, terrain militaire 39.

### Removed
- **Le candidat Google Places quitte les Sites militaires : une recherche par
  NOM n'est pas un relevé.** Le bouton `SEARCH NEARBY SITES` envoyait une
  recherche textuelle Google Places sur les mots « military installation »,
  biaisée sur le centre du cadrage, 5 résultats au plus. Google ne publie aucun
  type militaire exploitable : la branche qui aurait promu un résultat typé
  `military_base` n'avait donc jamais de quoi mordre, et **tout retombait en
  candidat violet — un lieu dont le nom ressemblait**. Un musée de la guerre,
  un magasin de surplus, un bureau de recrutement entraient par la même porte.

  Ce que cette classe coûtait, ligne par ligne : une cinquième teinte à décoder,
  une ligne de clé dont le seul travail était d'avertir qu'elle ne revendiquait
  rien, un appel Places facturé par clic, et des marques `validation:
  'unreviewed'` sans emprise qui **disparaissaient au premier mouvement de
  caméra** — puisque chaque rechargement reconstruit la liste depuis Overpass
  seul. Une couche qui dit « site militaire cartographié » n'a pas à héberger
  une supposition qui s'évapore.

  Partent avec : le bouton et son gestionnaire, `searchNearby()`, le
  classificateur, la teinte violette, sa ligne de clé, le glyphe « ? » et le
  tracé Inter qu'il empruntait. **Le proxy `/api/google/text-search` reste** —
  la résolution d'annotations s'en sert, et lui seul. La couche annonce
  désormais `OpenStreetMap` tout court : chaque marque à l'écran vient d'un tag.

### Changed
- **Le réseau IDFM et sa fréquence ne sont plus deux puces : c'est une couche,
  et un clic sur un arrêt donne enfin les deux.** Île-de-France Mobilités
  publie son offre deux fois — le référentiel des arrêts (37 956 arrêts,
  2 121 lignes avec leur livrée officielle, ODbL 1.0) et l'offre horaire
  moyenne (1 311 578 lignes de courses par arrêt et par tranche d'une heure,
  Licence Ouverte v2.0). Le dépôt en avait fait deux couches, deux puces sur la
  ligne « Transports en commun », deux fiches. Elles dessinaient LES MÊMES
  arrêts : mesuré le 2026-09-02, **34 903 des 36 502 arrêts de l'offre (95,6 %)
  se joignent sur `arrets.arrid`**. Le lecteur venu poser une seule question —
  *qu'est-ce qui dessert cette adresse, et à quelle fréquence* — devait savoir
  qu'il fallait appuyer deux fois, et le clic répondait avec la moitié que le
  hasard du picking avait attrapée.

  **Une puce, une fiche, deux publications.** `idfm-frequency` n'est plus une
  couche du tout : son module est fondu dans `idfmNetwork.js`, qui garde son
  identifiant, son jeton de partage `if` et sa ligne dans le panneau. Un clic
  sur un arrêt — sur le pictogramme de mode comme sur le disque de fréquence
  posé au même point — ouvre UNE fiche : mode, arrondissement, zone tarifaire
  et accessibilité du référentiel, puis les départs par heure de la tranche
  choisie, la courbe de la journée, premier/pointe/dernier, le total du jour,
  la même tranche sur les sept jours, et les DEUX licences. Les sept puces
  d'heure et l'échelle de couleurs déménagent avec.

  **Ce qui manque est nommé, jamais chiffré à zéro.** Un arrêt du référentiel
  absent du fichier d'offre — **3 053 des 37 956, soit 8,0 %** — le dit ; un
  arrêt regardé de trop haut dit que l'offre horaire n'est pas lue à cette
  altitude ; les **549 arrêts (1,50 %) sans coordonnée publiée** restent
  comptés dans la légende et jamais placés. Un zéro, ici, est une mesure.

- **L'aplat par département de la fréquence est retiré de la carte.** C'était
  le régime large de l'ancienne couche : au-dessus de sa porte de vue, huit
  polygones portant la moyenne de départs par heure et par arrêt. Un aplat doit
  laisser passer l'imagerie satellite en dessous, donc son alpha plafonne à
  0,60 — et à l'altitude où ces polygones étaient la seule chose à l'écran, le
  résultat se lisait comme un lavis pâle sur la moitié de la France plutôt que
  comme une lecture. Le pli survit côté serveur, à
  `GET /api/idfm-frequency/region` (356 lignes d'agrégat + 17 recensements
  d'arrêts → 14 719 octets bruts / 5 864 gzippés) ; plus rien dans le
  navigateur ne l'importe.

  Le jeton de partage `fq` est **retiré et non réattribué** : un lien déjà
  parti qui le porte est rejeté en entier, ce qui est le comportement honnête,
  et le donner à un autre sujet ferait allumer silencieusement la mauvaise
  couche. `npm run qa:idfm-network` prouve les six comportements de la fusion
  dans l'application réelle, fiche peinte comprise.

### Changed
- **« Brancher un jeu de données » rendait la liste des couches inutilisable :
  244 px de formulaire mort pour 51 px de couches, une ligne visible sur 39.**
  Mesuré le 2026-09-10 sur un viewport de MacBook Air (1440×820), là où le
  panneau DATA LAYERS ne reçoit que 367 px de couloir. La boîte se croyait
  fermée — `form.hidden = true` au démarrage, et rien dans le JS ne disait le
  contraire — mais chacune de ses sections est posée en `display: flex` par une
  règle de classe, et une règle de classe l'emporte sur le `[hidden]
  { display: none }` du navigateur. Le champ de recherche, une carte de
  brouillon VIDE et ses deux sélecteurs de colonnes sans option étaient donc
  peints en permanence, sous la liste qu'ils écrasaient. La faute n'existait
  dans aucun des deux fichiers, seulement dans la cascade entre les deux ;
  `src/data/datasetPlugPanelLayout.test.mjs` compare désormais les spécificités
  et échoue si une règle de `display` repasse devant.

  **La boîte a trois tailles, et seule la troisième coûte quelque chose à la
  liste.** Au repos, une ligne fine de 27 px : la liste garde 270 px, quatre
  lignes de couches entières au lieu d'une. Ouverte d'un clic, 78 px — le champ
  et rien d'autre, parce qu'un clic sur un bouton n'est pas la preuve qu'on
  branche quoi que ce soit. La troisième taille n'arrive qu'avec une preuve :
  une liste de candidats à l'écran, ou un brouillon en main. Là seulement la
  boîte prend 209 px et fait défiler ses 530 px de contenu, et la liste des
  couches conserve un plancher de 88 px. Sur un écran de 1920×1200 les mêmes
  règles donnent 601 px de couches au repos (huit lignes) et 243 px pendant le
  travail. Refermer rend tout, immédiatement : le brouillon et les candidats
  survivent à l'aller-retour, donc aller regarder ses couches ne coûte rien.

  **Trois conséquences plus petites, du même diagnostic.** BRANCHER et ANNULER
  sortent de la zone défilante — le brouillon est plus haut que la part de
  boîte d'un panneau de 13 pouces, et un bouton qu'il faut aller chercher est
  un bouton qu'on rate. La boîte disparaît quand on replie DATA LAYERS, ce
  qu'elle ne faisait pas. Et les jeux déjà branchés, qui ont leur propre ligne
  dans la liste sous JEUX BRANCHÉS, ne sont plus répétés au repos : leur nombre
  passe en bout de la ligne d'ouverture, les rangs avec le manifeste et la
  croix attendent à l'intérieur.
- **La reconstitution du mégafeu ne déclare plus le feu terminé : ses deux bouts
  nomment une détection.** Le curseur affichait `■ 1ᵉʳ août 12:44 UTC · fin de
  l'événement`, et la clé sous cette ligne ajoutait « le feu est éteint depuis le
  1ᵉʳ août 2026 ». Aucune des trois sources du pack ne dit ça. 12:44 est la
  `FINALDATE` d'EFFIS — le dernier instant où un algorithme a vu ce sol brûler,
  qui se trouve être aussi la dernière détection FIRMS retenue dans la fenêtre ;
  11:55 au départ est sa `FIREDATE`, six heures **avant** que le COGIC signale
  l'incendie. Copernicus EMS cartographie et ne déclare rien ; la déclaration
  officielle est un communiqué de préfecture, de la prose sans jeu de données ni
  API, avec deux mots — « fixé », puis « éteint » — qu'un feu de tourbe peut
  séparer de plusieurs semaines. Les deux bouts lisent donc `première détection`
  et `dernière détection`, les seules choses que le pack sait dater.

  **Et la clé nomme enfin la dernière image.** L'état de fin porte deux instants
  et le lecteur n'en voyait qu'un : la fenêtre se ferme sur une détection à
  12:44, soit 66 minutes après la dernière **image**, celle du 1ᵉʳ août 11:38
  (`GRA_MONIT01`, cinquième et dernier produit livré pour l'activation EMSR899).
  C'est pourquoi la ligne du périmètre annonce 11:38 pendant que le curseur
  annonce 12:44 — un écart que rien n'expliquait. Le blurb de fin le dit
  maintenant, et le libellé de l'image est lu dans le pack, pas tapé.

  Rien de dessiné ne change : ni la fenêtre, ni les cinq périmètres, ni le
  contour de clôture d'EFFIS à 37 191 ha qui reste, lui, ce que la couche a de
  plus proche d'une fin.
- **Le trafic live n'attend plus le graphe routier : TomTom se dessine
  lui-même, et le conteneur retrouve Overpass.** « Ça prend très, très
  longtemps à s'afficher, voire ça ne s'affiche pas du tout » — le coupable
  n'était pas TomTom. Mesuré le 2026-09-10 sur l'origine hébergée : une tuile
  TomTom répond en 32–174 ms, quatre en parallèle en 86 ms, et le décodage
  coûte 5–10 ms. Pendant ce temps `/api/overpass` rendait **502 après 25,4 s**.

  **La cause était une adresse.** `overpass-api.de` et `lz4.overpass-api.de`
  ne répondent à ce VPS qu'en **IPv6** : leurs deux adresses IPv4
  (162.55.144.139, 65.109.112.52) refusent la connexion en 16 ms, tandis que
  la même requête en IPv6 rend 200 avec 1 056 ways. Le pont Docker par défaut
  est IPv4 seul, donc *dans le conteneur* la paire FOSSGIS était injoignable et
  tout le trafic routier retombait sur `overpass.private.coffee`, qui répond
  429. `deploy/vps/docker-compose.yml` déclare maintenant un réseau IPv6 (ULA
  NATé vers l'adresse globale de l'hôte) : `/api/overpass` est repassé à
  **200 / 1 056 ways en 1,0 s**.

  **Et la couche ne dépend plus de ça pour montrer une mesure.** Les points
  animés roulent sur des polylignes OSM et TomTom n'en décidait que la
  COULEUR — donc sans Overpass, les tuiles arrivaient, décodaient, et n'avaient
  rien à peindre. `src/data/flowRibbons.js` dessine désormais la géométrie de
  TomTom elle-même, en un seul `GroundPolylinePrimitive` batché (l'idiome de
  `roadStatusFrance.js` : couleur ET largeur par instance). La couche a deux
  moitiés qui se dégradent séparément : le RUBAN n'a besoin que de TomTom, les
  POINTS ont encore besoin d'Overpass, et chacun peut être à l'écran sans
  l'autre. Paris, palier rue : 2 tuiles, 78 Ko, 3 942 segments, **9,4 ms** de
  construction. La puce `FLUX TOMTOM` le coupe.

  **Le zoom des tuiles suit enfin le palier de caméra.** `fetchFlowForBounds`
  était figé à z12 : sur la boîte de 0,30° du palier `metro` cela demandait
  **30 tuiles** pour une seule vue, contre une règle d'edge qui n'en autorise
  30 que par tranche de dix secondes pour TOUT `/api`. Le palier porte
  maintenant son `flowZoom` (z10 au large, 4 tuiles) et son `ribbonMinClass` :
  une tuile de flux ne s'éclaircit pas avec l'altitude, les quatre tuiles z10
  de Paris décodent 27 080 segments dont l'essentiel est sous-pixel à 20 km.

  **Deux requêtes sur quatre n'étaient qu'un doublon.** Le cache de décodage
  n'enregistrait une tuile qu'une fois RÉSOLUE, donc le préchauffage et
  l'appariement aux routes manquaient tous les deux et partaient tous les deux.
  Une table des requêtes en vol les fusionne (`tilesJoined` le compte), et les
  tuiles portent enfin un `Cache-Control: private, max-age=<reste des 120 s>`
  au lieu de `no-store` — `private` parce que le préprod est derrière une
  authentification et qu'aucun cache partagé ne doit pouvoir rejouer une tuile
  au-delà du portillon.

  **Enfin, un 429 dit de qui il vient.** N'importe quel 429 se lisait
  « TomTom daily budget reached » ; celui de l'edge — 30 requêtes/10 s, qui
  se vide en secondes et ne coûte rien — envoyait donc chercher une facture qui
  n'existe pas. Le proxy estampille le sien (`x-tomtom-limit: budget`, avec un
  `Retry-After` jusqu'à la bascule UTC), le client obéit au `Retry-After` en
  servant son dernier décodage plutôt qu'en martelant, et un 429 non étiqueté
  ne prend le parti de personne.
- **Le panneau DISPLAY s'ouvre désormais sur les réglages du propriétaire, pas
  sur ceux d'août.** Une capture de sa propre console, le 2026-09-10, contre
  quatre valeurs de premier lancement : la détection ouvre en `BALANCED` à
  `50 %` au lieu de `DENSE` à `75 %`, le fondu des étiquettes (Fade) passe de
  `7 %` à `24 %`, l'opacité hors lucarne (Outside) de `1 %` à `37 %`, et le
  fondu du masque circulaire (Feather) de `11 %` à `49 %`. HUD `tactical`, 3D
  en `Proximity`, Scope allumé, Celestial éteint et Sharpen à `49 %` étaient
  déjà ces défauts-là et n'ont pas bougé.

  **Le premier lancement cesse d'emprunter le look tactique.** `DENSE @ 75 %`
  était littéralement le même objet gelé que les styles militaires et le mode
  Contacts appliquent ; un premier lancement le lisait par coïncidence. Il a
  maintenant le sien, `FIRST_RUN_DETECTION_PRESET`, déclaré à côté de
  `MILITARY_DETECTION_PRESET` — qui n'a pas changé, donc CRT/NVG/FLIR et
  Contacts continuent de forcer le même Dense qu'avant. Au passage, `50` était
  déjà la valeur du curseur de densité dans le markup, celle de son affichage
  et celle du moteur de détection : c'est la base de premier lancement qui les
  écrasait à 75 à chaque démarrage.

  **Ce que la remontée d'Outside coûte au plancher des brackets AIR.**
  `AIRCRAFT_BRACKET_FLOOR_ANCHOR` suit le défaut qu'il calibre — c'est la règle
  écrite depuis 2026-08-24 — et le voilà à `0,37`. À cette ancre, toute la
  rampe passe sous la diagonale : le plancher ne relève plus rien, à aucun
  réglage, y compris à un `1 %` composé à la main où les brackets latéraux
  s'effacent désormais avec leurs propres étiquettes. C'est consigné dans
  `detectionPolicy.test.mjs` plutôt que caché, et redescendre le défaut
  réarme le mécanisme tel quel.

  **Un défaut a cinq surfaces, et deux replis qui n'en sont pas.** Constante
  moteur, valeur du curseur, son affichage, `GLOBAL_POST_DEFAULTS` et l'état de
  départ du générateur de liens ont bougé ensemble ; les replis de LECTURE
  `scf` (35) et `ko` (5) restent où ils sont, parce qu'ils répondent à ce que
  voyait l'auteur d'un lien qui omet le champ. Épinglé dans
  `src/reasonableDefaults.test.mjs`. Un lien de partage, ou la main de
  l'opérateur, l'emporte toujours : `dm=OFF` restaure toujours OFF.

- **Les bus de Normandie cessent de sprinter puis de se garer : ils roulent, à
  la vitesse que leur propre exploitant publie.** Le point GTFS-RT est une
  déclaration sur le PASSÉ, et sur la plupart des réseaux français une
  déclaration vieille. Mesuré le 2026-09-10 sur l'agrégat Atoumod (239
  véhicules) : le point médian affiché a **189 s** (p90 350 s), et le flux ne
  publie **aucune vitesse**. Ce qui se voyait à l'écran n'était donc pas un bus
  qui avance : c'était un bus figé pendant deux minutes, puis traîné sur 200 m
  à 1,8 km en 90 secondes, puis figé de nouveau.

  **Le même exploitant savait déjà où il était.** Son autre message, le
  `TripUpdate` qu'on télécharge déjà pour afficher le retard, place la course
  **2 à 3 arrêts plus loin** en médiane (p90 : 5 à 7) que son propre flux de
  positions. Le bus n'était pas seulement en retard d'affichage : il était en
  retard d'une information qu'on avait sous la main.

  **Alors on le fait avancer sur SA ligne, jamais au cap.** Pas de navigation à
  l'estime — un bus extrapolé sur un cap traverse la Seine, et il n'y a de
  toute façon pas de vitesse à extrapoler. Le chemin est le tracé de la ligne
  (ou la droite entre ses prochains arrêts), et la vitesse n'est pas estimée :
  elle tombe de deux heures prédites et de la distance entre les deux arrêts
  auxquels elles appartiennent, retard compris. Le point réel reste l'ancre :
  le glyphe ne recule jamais derrière le dernier endroit où l'exploitant l'a vu.

  **Deux réglages sortent d'un rejeu, pas d'un goût.** 22 minutes du vrai flux
  enregistrées, 6 314 instants où un point réel POSTÉRIEUR existait à moins de
  45 s — donc jamais dans l'entrée. L'erreur de la position dessinée passe de
  **292 m à 165 m en médiane** et de 807 m à 707 m en p90, et **72 %** des
  véhicules projetés sont plus près de la vérité qu'avant. On n'engage que
  **70 %** de l'avance prévue : à 100 % la médiane est meilleure mais la p90
  devient PIRE que de ne rien faire, parce que les prédictions dépassent — et
  un bus dessiné après un carrefour qu'il n'a pas atteint est la panne qu'on
  voit. Rien n'est touché sous **30 s** d'âge.

  **Et ça se dit.** La ligne de la couche compte les véhicules concernés
  (`14 projected`), et la fiche imprime la distance et le nombre d'arrêts
  franchis à côté de l'âge du vrai point : `⏱ fix 4m ago` puis `➟ drawn 642 m,
  2 stops on — projected along its run, not reported`. C'est la seule chose de
  cette couche qui déplace un contact loin d'une position publiée, donc la
  seule qui doive être annoncée.

- **Un bus, un glyphe : la Seine-Eure cesse d'être comptée deux fois.** Le
  détecteur de doublons compare des FLOTTES ENTIÈRES, et il est donc aveugle à
  un flux qui est un sous-ensemble strict d'un autre. Mesuré le 2026-09-10 :
  `Semo Bus` (19 véhicules) et l'agrégat `Atoumod` (239) publient les mêmes
  courses — mêmes `trip_id`, mêmes coordonnées **au mètre**, mêmes horodatages
  — sous deux préfixes d'identifiant. Autour de Val-de-Reuil et de
  Pont-de-l'Arche, chaque bus était dessiné deux fois, l'un exactement derrière
  l'autre, et le compteur de la couche affichait le double : 32 contacts pour
  16 bus.

  La fusion se fait sur la COURSE, parce qu'une course GTFS est un trajet servi
  par un véhicule à la fois. Le survivant est choisi par identifiant de flux et
  jamais par fraîcheur — un vainqueur choisi à la fraîcheur changerait d'identité
  chaque fois que les deux éditeurs se dépassent, et le glyphe perdrait son
  glissement et la sélection de qui l'avait cliqué. La POSITION, elle, vient du
  relevé le plus récent : sur 378 paires appariées, ce n'est **jamais** le flux
  local (l'agrégat mène de 60 s en médiane, jusqu'à 207 s). Le nombre de
  contacts fusionnés est publié sur le fil plutôt qu'absorbé en silence.
- **La légende des bouées marines cesse de plaider et se contente de nommer :
  douze lignes et 692 px deviennent huit et 219.** Le bloc de droite portait
  388 mots pour une seule couche. Quatre de ces lignes étaient une RÈGLE
  GRADUÉE — `8 m`, `2 m`, `0,5 m`, et le plancher sous 0,2 m — 99 mots pour
  apprendre à un lecteur à inverser un facteur ×10 000 à l'œil. Trois autres
  récitaient la défense du dispositif : `ÉCHELLE DE LECTURE`, `REDONDANCE
  DÉLIBÉRÉE`, `Domaine gelé`, `Coût : 1,4 % de l'échelle`.

  **La règle part parce que la carte imprime déjà les mètres.** Jusqu'à 96
  bouées portent leur fiche, et le peloton qui en reçoit une est trié par
  hauteur de houle — donc les plus grandes tiges à l'écran sont exactement
  celles dont le relevé exact est écrit à côté, `1.0 m · Slight`. Une échelle
  que personne n'a besoin d'inverser n'a pas besoin de graduations. Ce que la
  tige porte encore, c'est le RELIEF et l'ORDRE, et un ordre se lit sur les
  marques elles-mêmes : la tempête de Gascogne écrase la Manche d'à côté
  qu'une clé imprime « 8 m » ou non.

  **Ce qui reste, c'est une ligne par marque dessinée.** `Une tige = des
  vagues mesurées. Plus haute, plus grosses` · `Cercle creux = bouée sans
  capteur de vagues` · `Tige en tirets = mer au-delà de 14 m, hors échelle` ·
  `Couleur = état de la mer, le nom qu'en donnent les marins`, puis les
  classes OMM présentes ce jour-là avec leur compte — qui sont la lecture du
  jour (« 98 bouées en mer peu agitée, 41 agitée ») et la raison pour laquelle
  l'échelle reste neuf lignes plutôt qu'un dégradé qui ne compterait rien.
  La ligne des tirets n'apparaît que lorsqu'une bouée est vraiment hors
  échelle, et son pastille est désormais en tirets elle aussi : la clé
  dessinait un trait plein pour annoncer des pointillés.

  **Une seule ligne garde une phrase, et ce n'est pas facultatif.** La règle
  F7(a) de `CARTOGRAPHIE.md` est P0 : une hauteur déclare son registre *dans
  la légende*, en toutes lettres. La ligne de la tige lit donc « Échelle de
  lecture, pas une hauteur réelle : 1 m de houle dessine 10 km de tige » —
  quatorze mots, contre cent un.

  **Rien n'est perdu, tout a changé d'endroit.** Les seuils restent gelés (C1),
  le plancher et le plafond restent comptés — `getStats().swell` publie
  `floored`, `clipped` et l'histogramme cumulatif `atOrAbove` — et l'argument
  du dispositif reste dans l'en-tête du module, là où le lit quelqu'un qui peut
  le changer. Mesuré dans le DOM à 1440×900, sur le même relevé : la clé passe
  de 692 px de contenu dans une fenêtre de 216 px — 3,2 écrans de défilement,
  le titre « Bouées marines » sorti par le haut — à 219 px, soit un écran.
- **Les pastilles de bruit des aéroports parlent français : la conséquence
  d'abord, le seuil comme preuve, et quatre lignes au lieu de huit.** Une zone A
  à Bordeaux-Mérignac disait « Zone A · LFBD — B. MERIGNAC / 70 Lden dB(A) /
  gêne très forte — constructions à usage d'habitation interdites / arrêté du
  22/12/2004 / arrêté : http://… / avions seulement — contours généralisés au
  1:39 757 ». Six lignes de données, huit lignes à l'écran : l'URL en prenait
  deux et l'avertissement deux. Elle dit maintenant :

  > Bruit des avions · zone A — B. MERIGNAC
  > gêne très forte : logements neufs interdits
  > 70 dB(A) et plus en moyenne sur 24 h
  > arrêté préfectoral du 22/12/2004 · LFBD
  > avions seulement, ni route ni train — tracé à ~11 m près

  Le titre dit **de quoi on parle** : « Zone A » est une lettre du Code de
  l'urbanisme, et sur un polygone coloré elle n'apprend à personne qu'il s'agit
  du bruit des avions. La conséquence pour ce sol passe en tête, le seuil
  devient sa preuve, et le code OACI descend sur la ligne de l'arrêté — c'est ce
  qu'il identifie, le fichier s'appelant `PEB_<OACI>_<JJ>_<MM>_<AAAA>.pdf`.

  **Trois corrections d'exactitude sont passées avec la lisibilité.** « 70 » est
  un plancher et non une mesure : le registre publie l'anneau le plus intérieur
  avec ses deux seuils égaux (70/70 en Lden, 96/96 en psophique) parce qu'il n'y
  a rien au-delà, et la carte dit désormais « 70 dB(A) **et plus** » — conditionné
  à la lettre de zone, jamais à l'égalité des nombres, qu'une bande amputée d'un
  seuil produit aussi. « 1:39 757 » devient « ~11 m » (~1,1 km en vue
  d'ensemble), qui n'est pas une nouvelle donnée mais la seule forme du même
  chiffre qui dise à quelle distance d'une limite cesser de croire le
  remplissage. Et l'avertissement psophique monte sur la ligne du seuil
  (« ancien indice de 89 à 96 — pas des décibels ») : à Saint-Cyr, où la carte
  dépense quatre lignes sur deux zones qui se recouvrent, la phrase
  d'explication tombe en bas du budget, et deux chiffres qui ressemblent à des
  décibels doivent rester lisibles pour ce qu'ils sont sans elle.

  **Aucune carte ne porte plus l'URL de l'arrêté.** La surface est un canvas
  monté `interactive: false` : un lien n'y est pas un lien, c'est quatre-vingts
  caractères insélectionnables qui dépensent un quart de la carte pour être
  inutilisables. Les crédits gardent le service, la fiche garde la date.

  **Deux défauts trouvés en chemin.** La carte du repère perdait ses
  avertissements : elle ne passait pas par le budget de six lignes, en produisait
  huit, et les deux qui tombaient étaient « avions seulement » et l'échelle —
  la panne même que ce module documente avoir corrigée, restée vivante sur la
  seule carte qui n'y passait pas. Elle y passe, et l'ordre est devenu la
  priorité déclarée de la couche : la règle et son seuil, **puis** quelle zone a
  été retenue et ce qu'elle a battu, puis les contradictions du registre, puis
  l'arrêté — la date siégeait avant l'ambiguïté, donc un point couvert par deux
  zones qui se recouvrent imprimait sa provenance et laissait tomber le fait
  qu'il y avait eu un choix. Et la phrase du tirage mixte n'atteignait aucun
  écran : elle vivait dans un helper que seule la carte en mode point appelait,
  or `area` y est faux par construction.

  Mesuré le 2026-09-10 dans un vrai navigateur, avec le code de mise en page de
  l'application : les seize nouvelles lignes tiennent **toutes** sur une rangée,
  les quatre anciennes gardées en témoin se replient **toutes** en deux.

- **Les feux actifs restent collés au sol quand on déplace la carte.** Une
  détection FIRMS était peinte à la hauteur 0 — sur l'ellipsoïde WGS84, pas sur
  le sol — tant que sa cellule de MNT n'avait pas répondu sur le réseau.
  Mesuré dans l'application au-dessus des feux du Chiapas : les onze pastilles
  du cadre ont passé leur première seconde **293,2 m sous le terrain** qu'elles
  désignent, puis ont sauté à leur place. Une pastille enterrée n'est pas
  « un peu décalée » : le test de profondeur est désactivé pour qu'aucun feu ne
  soit avalé par le relief, donc elle est peinte quand même — et sa position à
  l'écran devient alors une fonction de la **pose de la caméra**. On tire la
  carte à la souris et les points glissent sur le paysage avant de se
  replacer : le « les feux bougent avec la carte au lieu d'y être fixes »
  signalé. Et ça recommence sur chaque bout de sol que la session n'a pas
  encore visité, c'est-à-dire exactement celui qu'on regarde quand on se
  promène.

  La couche lit maintenant la surface qu'elle **dessine** avant de poser ses
  pastilles : une sonde `scene.sampleHeight` par cellule de ~111 m, synchrone,
  sans réseau, plafonnée à 40 sondes par passe et coupée au-dessus de 25 km de
  caméra (au-delà, l'erreur vaut moins d'un pixel). Ce que le budget n'atteint
  pas emprunte le sol de la sonde la plus proche dans un rayon de 25 km — un
  complexe de feux tient sur un versant, et son relief se compte en mètres là
  où l'ellipsoïde se trompe de centaines. Le MNT Re:Earth reste l'autorité et
  reprend la main dès qu'il répond ; accord mesuré entre les deux surfaces :
  **+1,2 m** de moyenne sur neuf points de pinède landaise, **−1,3 m** à
  Bordeaux. Vérifié bout en bout avec le MNT coupé (proxy renvoyé en 503) :
  avant, les onze pastilles restaient à la hauteur 0 indéfiniment ; après,
  elles se posent à 226–378 m, aux mêmes hauteurs que celles que le MNT donne.

  Deux garde-fous, tous deux payés par une mesure. Une lecture prise pendant
  que les tuiles arrivent encore renvoie la tuile grossière qui, elle, est
  chargée : **76 m** là où le maillage drainé lit 293 m. C'est quatre fois
  mieux que l'ellipsoïde et toujours faux, donc la passe se déclare **due** et
  la couche revient la refaire quand les tuiles ont fini — « posé » n'est pas
  « bien posé ». Et une sonde sur un jeu de tuiles non streamé a renvoyé
  **−11 838 m** dans un run sans écran, d'où la bande de plausibilité
  (−500 m … 9 500 m) qui refuse ce genre de réponse. Le retour est borné :
  cinq réveils qui doublent (1,2 s → 19,2 s, ~37 s en tout), rechargés dès que
  la caméra bouge, pour qu'un sol sans couverture photoréaliste ne réveille
  pas indéfiniment une caméra à l'arrêt.
- **La légende des aéroports perd ses deux dernières lignes de forme : cinq
  lignes deviennent trois.** Ce matin la légende récitait encore « Piste
  tracée » (4 790 terrains) et « Emprise au sol » (418) sous les trois tiers,
  avec un blurb de 40 mots chacune. Ces deux lignes nommaient des **formes** —
  un trait au cap et à la longueur vrais, un contour levé par l'IGN — et une
  forme est justement ce qu'un lecteur décode sans clé : un trait posé le long
  d'une piste EST une piste, un contour rempli et plaqué au sol EST du sol. Il
  reste ce qu'aucune forme ne peut dire, la **couleur** : les trois tiers, et
  rien d'autre. Le bloc de droite passe de ~223 px à trois lignes pour cette
  couche, contre dix en début de semaine.

  **Rien de dessiné ne change.** Les pistes et les emprises sont toujours
  tracées, aux mêmes distances et dans les mêmes couleurs ; c'est la clé qui
  les commentait qui part. La fiche au clic dit toujours `piste 4 215 m
  revêtue` et nomme l'IGN sur la ligne du contour, et l'attribution BD TOPO®
  reste sur la ligne de couche et dans la fenêtre d'attributions — elle n'a
  jamais dépendu de la légende.

  Côté code, la couche n'a plus de `renderLegend` du tout : `airportMarkLegend`
  et les deux vignettes SVG qui n'existaient que pour elle (la barre, le
  contour) sont supprimées, et la clé de rendu redevient la seule classe de
  longueur — les suffixes `+rw` / `+fp`, qui n'existaient que pour permettre au
  comptage de distinguer les deux marques dans une seule case, partent avec.
- **Sous 30 km, les zones de bruit des aéroports arrivent déjà au tracé fin.**
  Le plan d'exposition au bruit est un jeu d'anneaux emboîtés, et au-dessus de
  12 km la couche cesse de demander « qu'y a-t-il sous ce point ? » pour
  demander « quels plans y a-t-il dans ce cadre ? » — une sonde par aérodrome,
  à une échelle cent fois plus large, la seule assez large pour que les zones B,
  C et D reviennent entières. Cette échelle est aussi celle à laquelle le
  service généralise le contour : la zone D de Roissy repart avec 37 sommets
  pour 65,8 km, un anneau à facettes visibles. Une seconde passe rattrape ça en
  refetchant chaque bande au 1:39 757 — et elle tournait **derrière** la
  réponse, donc le cadre où l'on descend justement pour regarder un aéroport
  s'affichait large puis se redessinait quelques secondes plus tard sous le
  lecteur.

  **Sous 30 km cette passe est maintenant jouée devant lui**, aérodrome le plus
  proche d'abord : la réponse part déjà au 1:39 757. Au-dessus, rien ne change —
  à 100 km la bande médiane fait 1,9 km pour un écran de 140, et l'écart entre
  37 sommets et 381 n'est plus visible par personne pour le même prix.

  **Ce n'est pas le plafond du mode ponctuel qui a bougé, et c'est délibéré.**
  La sonde ponctuelle doit sa finesse à un tampon de 11 m au sol, et ce tampon
  est exactement la raison pour laquelle elle ne renvoie qu'un anneau sur
  quatre : mesuré sur 25 aérodromes, 37 bandes distinctes au fin contre 88 au
  large, et neuf terrains — dont Toussus, Coulommiers et Pontoise — ne
  répondent rien du tout à l'échelle fine. Monter le mode ponctuel à 30 km
  aurait acheté un contour net en perdant les zones B, C et D en chemin.

  **L'attente est bornée à 4 s**, au-dessus des ~0,8 s que coûte un aérodrome à
  froid — donc celui que la caméra vise est toujours fin au premier affichage —
  et sous les 5 s du sondage d'affinage de la couche, pour qu'une passe
  tronquée ne s'empile jamais sur celui qui la suit. Ce que le budget n'a pas
  atteint reste large, le dit, et repart en tâche de fond ; une passe coupée
  par le budget ne pose pas `triedAt`, sinon le plan à moitié affiné de
  l'aéroport sous la caméra serait gelé pour dix minutes. Le coût est payé une
  fois par aérodrome et par mois : le cache disque des zones tient 30 jours,
  contre un registre qui a gagné 8 arrêtés en six ans.

  **Mesuré le 2026-09-10 à Roissy**, rayon 25 km, 18 aérodromes et 72 bandes,
  cache de zones vide : **2,66 s et 0 bande fine sur 72 sans le drapeau, 6,64 s
  et 27 sur 72 avec, 0,08 s et 72 sur 72 une fois la passe de fond arrivée**. Et
  sur cette première réponse fine, les quatre zones de LFPG reviennent à 110,
  247, 381 et 664 sommets — les chiffres de l'échelle fine, sur l'aérodrome que
  la caméra vise.

  **La fiche cesse d'envoyer le lecteur chercher ce qu'il a déjà.** La phrase
  « descendez sous 12 km pour la version fine » se lisait sur le MODE ; elle se
  lit maintenant sur la BANDE cliquée, qui porte l'échelle à laquelle son propre
  contour a été récupéré. Une bande déjà affinée affiche l'arrêté à la place ;
  une bande encore large dans une passe de premier plan dit que l'affinage
  n'est pas fini plutôt que de proposer une descente que le lecteur a déjà
  faite ; et la version large hors de cette tranche nomme 30 km. Le piège au
  passage : `Number(null) <= 39757` vaut `true`, donc l'écriture évidente de ce
  test aurait qualifié de « fine » la seule bande certaine d'être à facettes —
  celle qu'aucune passe n'a jamais touchée.

- **La pastille `DENSE` de la couche Satellites s'appelle `STARLINK`, et la
  classe qu'elle allume aussi.** `DENSE` nommait la MANIÈRE dont le catalogue
  se charge — des milliers de points de plus, sur un budget de propagation
  relâché — et pas ce qui apparaît dans le ciel quand on clique. La seule
  réponse à « à quoi correspond cette pastille ? » vivait donc dans l'infobulle,
  qui, elle, disait Starlink depuis le début. Le bouton lit maintenant
  `STARLINK`, `STARLINK ···` pendant que la coquille arrive, et `STARLINK ✕`
  avec la raison au survol quand le flux CelesTrak tombe.

  **La légende de la ligne suit, et perd un mot au passage.** La classe qui
  n'existe qu'avec cette pastille allumée s'appelait `COMMS`, et la carte de
  l'objet suivi lisait `COMMS · STARLINK` — deux mots dont le premier ne se
  reliait à rien de visible, pour désigner une chose que le second nommait
  déjà. Le libellé de classe devient `STARLINK`, et le sous-type disparaît
  plutôt que de dire `STARLINK · STARLINK`. La couleur ne bouge pas : l'ardoise
  sourde tenue à ~0,40 de luma Rec.601 contre ~0,69 pour VISUAL, pour que la
  coquille reste séparable quand NVG et FLIR écrasent la scène sur un canal.

  **Aucun lien de partage ne casse.** Seules les surfaces lisibles changent :
  le paramètre reste `catalog: 'core' | 'dense'`, son code dans le hash reste
  `d`, et la clé de classe reste `comms` — le créneau de famille qu'une seconde
  constellation large bande viendrait rejoindre le jour où le mode en chargerait
  une autre que Starlink.

### Added
- **Le mégafeu de Gironde prend feu : des panaches de flamme et de fumée là où
  FIRMS a vu brûler, et qui marchent avec le front.** La reconstitution montrait
  cinq périmètres, des fronts, des flammes photo-interprétées et 9 524 points
  chauds. Tout était juste et rien ne brûlait : à l'écran, un incendie de
  37 191 ha était un aplat rouge.

  **Ce qui est mesuré, et ce qui est dessiné — la distinction est dans la
  légende, pas seulement dans le code.** Un panache ne se dresse que là où NASA
  FIRMS a relevé une anomalie thermique dans les **12 h** précédant le curseur,
  à l'intensité de la puissance radiative du groupe, et jamais sous le premier
  barreau de l'échelle FRP du pack (10 MW) — ce plancher est ce qui laisse
  l'image de clôture parfaitement calme, le feu ayant été déclaré éteint. Et il
  penche dans la direction où le feu a **réellement progressé** entre deux
  images Copernicus, relevée sur le déplacement des flammes photo-interprétées :
  c'est-à-dire sous le vent, sans jamais consulter un modèle de vent. Hauteur de
  colonne, taille des bouffées, vitesse d'ascension et de dérive sont un rendu,
  et la clé de carte porte la ligne « colonne de fumée — rendu, non mesuré » à
  côté des polygones qui, eux, ont été tracés à la main sur des images à 30 cm.

  **`Cesium.ParticleSystem` ne pouvait pas servir.** Il tire son delta de
  `frameState.time`, donc de `viewer.clock`, que cette application n'anime
  jamais — mode requête, zéro tic mesuré en une minute. Un système de particules
  posé ici émet une fois puis se fige. Le champ est donc roulé à la main sur un
  delta `performance.now()`, dans **une seule** `BillboardCollection` par
  matière : six panaches coûtent un lot de dessin au lieu de douze, et toute la
  simulation se teste dans Node sans GPU.

  **Un feu n'est pas gratuit, et il est borné par trois portes.** Des particules
  animées exigent une image par image, donc le gouverneur de rendu est tenu
  ouvert — la couche s'éteint dès que l'une des trois se ferme : plus de
  détection fraîche sous le curseur, caméra à plus de 400 km, ou profil `lite`,
  qui divise le nombre de panaches **et** le débit d'émission derrière chacun.
  La couche s'ouvrant sur l'image de clôture, l'allumer ne coûte rien tant que
  le lecteur n'a pas rejoué le feu.

### Fixed
- **Cliquer une mission spatiale sur le globe ouvre enfin sa fiche.** La fiche
  `SELECTED SPACE MISSION` se remplissait déjà au clic — nom, statut, pas de
  tir, orbite, distance à la Terre, charge utile, rejeu de l'ascension — mais
  elle est peinte dans la vue `SPACE MISSIONS` du panneau CONTEXTE, et le clic
  laissait jusqu'à deux portes fermées devant elle. Il fallait aller chercher
  la réponse à sa propre question.

  **Deux états, deux pannes distinctes.** Quand la couche a été allumée depuis
  DATA LAYERS, le mode est adopté et la vue est déjà la bonne, mais le panneau
  se repose **replié** : la fiche n'a aucune boîte. Après un rechargement ou
  l'ouverture d'un lien de partage — le cas courant — la couche revient allumée
  avec une origine que l'entonnoir d'entrée du CONTEXTE refuse par principe,
  donc le mode n'a jamais été adopté et la vue est **masquée** en plus : les
  missions sont dessinées, cliquables et listées pendant que le panneau propose
  encore `SPACE MISSIONS` comme si rien ne tournait. Un clic ouvre maintenant
  les deux portes.

  **Ce n'est pas une entrée dans le mode.** Aucun instantané n'est capturé et
  aucune couche n'est éteinte : la couche tournait déjà avant le clic, il n'y a
  donc pas d'état d'avant-entrée à restaurer ni rien que l'opérateur ait
  demandé à perdre. Une couche allumée avant le clic — `local-firms` dans le
  banc — l'est toujours après, et le reste quand on ressort du mode. Le clic
  n'emprunte pas non plus le panneau à une session CONTACTS en cours.

- **La lecture du mégafeu disait enfin où elle en est, et qu'elle est finie.**
  Trois défauts signalés d'une seule voix — « je ne sais pas trop où j'en suis
  quand j'appuie sur play, et une fois la simulation faite le bouton reste sur
  pause ».

  La ligne de la couche et la clé de carte portent désormais l'instant sous le
  curseur et le jour où il tombe (`▶ 26 juil. 04:12 UTC · jour 4 sur 10`), et la
  bande des cinq puces — déjà dans l'ordre chronologique — allume celle de
  l'image tenue pendant la lecture : elle devient la barre d'avancement qui
  manquait, pour le prix d'une classe CSS. Le bouton distingue enfin **trois**
  états d'arrêt au lieu d'un : `▶ Jouer` avant le départ, `▶ Reprendre` à
  l'arrêt en cours de route, `↺ Rejouer` une fois la fenêtre parcourue.

  **La cause du bouton figé n'était pas dans la couche.** Les panneaux sont
  construits une seule fois, au démarrage, et à ce moment-là chaque couche est
  une **souche paresseuse** qui n'expose pas `setRowControlsListener` — l'appel
  optionnel du gestionnaire ne faisait donc rien, en silence, et le vrai module
  n'apparaît qu'au premier allumage. Conséquence : **aucune couche paresseuse du
  dépôt ne pouvait repeindre sa propre ligne**. Le rappel est maintenant
  réinstallé juste après `init()`, quand le module existe. Même forme de défaut
  que le conteneur de puces corrigé la veille, et pour la même raison de fond :
  une ligne est construite contre une souche et vit contre un module.

## [Unreleased] — 2026-09-09

### Added
- **Le bâtiment devient un pivot : un clic sur un volume dit ce que ce sol a
  valu, ce qui y a été autorisé, et ce que le PLU y permet.** Un volume BD TOPO
  résolvait déjà son identité RNB, ses adresses BAN et ses parcelles
  cadastrales. Il ne pouvait pas dire les trois choses qu'un lecteur devant un
  bâtiment veut vraiment savoir.

  **Le blocage annoncé n'existait pas, et le vérifier est ce qui a rendu ce
  module petit.** Le plan disait que les trois tirages sont « des requêtes
  réseau déclenchées par une carte, ce que le dépôt ne fait nulle part
  aujourd'hui ». Deux moitiés de cette phrase sont fausses : le motif existe
  (`cadastreParcels` publie sa carte tout de suite, lance deux requêtes, garde
  en cache par parcelle, annule à la re-sélection — et la couche bâtiments fait
  déjà exactement cela pour le RNB), et **aucune requête n'est nécessaire** :
  DVF, Sitadel et le GPU sont trois couches déjà chargées pour la même vue. Les
  ventes portent `id_parcelle`, les permis portent la parcelle qui les a reçus,
  et le zonage est un jeu de polygones avec une requête par point. La réponse
  est donc une **lecture** de ce qui est déjà en mémoire — la propriété que le
  plan appelait l'obstacle est en fait la solution.

  La carte d'un bâtiment gagne jusqu'à trois lignes, dans l'ordre où on se pose
  les questions : `Vendu juillet 2024 · 560 000 € · 14 359 €/m² — DVF, sur
  cette parcelle`, `Permis : DP · Autorisé · décembre 2019 — Sitadel, sur cette
  parcelle`, `PLU : UGSU — Zone urbaine générale · 1 servitude`.

  **Chaque ligne n'existe que si sa propre ligne du panneau est allumée**, ce
  qui est le contrat de `layerJoins.js` et la forme honnête ici : une fiche qui
  irait chercher DVF dans le dos du lecteur serait un second balayage d'un
  registre qu'il a choisi de ne pas ouvrir, au rayon et au millésime qu'il n'a
  pas choisis. Une carte sans aucune des trois couches est exactement celle que
  le dépôt dessinait avant.

  **La clé de jointure est vérifiée sur données vivantes** : le RNB publie
  `75104000AE0003`, DVF publie `75104000AD0034`, et Sitadel publie les morceaux
  — commune, section, numéro, sans préfixe — que le cadastre complète à la
  pose. Les 4 500 parcelles du paquet de Paris s'assemblent toutes ; sur un
  disque de 300 m au centre, 3 des 89 parcelles vendues portent aussi un permis.
  Un morceau manquant est un **refus**, jamais un rembourrage : un préfixe lu
  `000` alors qu'il vaut `801` désigne une autre parcelle de la même commune, et
  Toulouse en publie 46.

- **Le globe photoréaliste revient, par Cesium ion.** Google retire les tuiles
  3D et le satellite aux projets facturés dans l'EEE depuis le 8 juillet 2025 :
  la restriction porte sur l'adresse de facturation du projet, jamais sur le
  lecteur, et la pastille « Google 3D » était grise ici depuis. Cesium ion
  publie le **même** jeu de tuiles (asset `2275207`) sous son propre contrat
  Google, facturé aux États-Unis. L'application essaie donc sa clé d'abord, et
  quand Google la refuse elle passe par ion sans rien demander. Mesuré depuis
  la France le 2026-09-09 : 403 sur la clé du dépôt, puis 474 tuiles Google
  servies par ion et le globe qui ouvre sur Paris. Un jeton ion **gratuit**
  suffit, et un build sans aucune clé Google y a droit aussi — c'est la route
  que `npm run doctor` annonçait déjà sans qu'elle existe.

  **Ce que ça coûte, et qui doit le savoir.** Le palier gratuit d'ion est
  « personnel et non commercial » : il impose à l'écran le crédit
  « Upgrade for commercial use. » à côté des logos Cesium ion et Google. Les
  trois arrivent avec l'asset et ne se retirent pas. Une clé Google facturée
  hors EEE reste le chemin propre pour un produit payant ; sinon c'est le
  palier ion commercial. `DATA_SOURCES.md` porte les deux lignes.
- **Un département en vigilance crues dit enfin quelle rivière.** L'étiquette
  de Météo-France disait `Aude · Orange · Crues` et ne pouvait pas nommer le
  cours d'eau : un tronçon Vigicrues ne porte **aucun code de département**, et
  le rattacher demande un point-dans-polygone. L'audit avait classé ce point
  comme « beaucoup de machinerie pour une étiquette d'une ligne ».

  Ce n'est cher que si on le fait pour les 337 tronçons. **Hors épisode, tous
  sont verts** — c'est l'entête de la couche Vigicrues elle-même — et un tronçon
  vert n'est sur aucune étiquette : le travail est donc proportionnel à ce qui
  est **élevé**, c'est-à-dire zéro par temps calme et une poignée pendant une
  crue. L'index de contours existait déjà (`franceDepartements.js`, celui du
  bilan national IRVE) ; le même fichier est simplement indexé une seconde fois,
  comme `delinquanceFrance.js` le fait déjà.

  L'étiquette devient `Aude · Orange · Crues · Orbieu, Aude aval, Berre +1` —
  le plus sévère d'abord, trois noms puis un compte. **Un tronçon est nommé dans
  chaque département qu'il traverse** : la Loire aval en traverse quatre, et en
  créditer un seul refuserait aux trois autres un nom dont leur bulletin parle.
  Les rivières n'apparaissent que si le bulletin du département porte bien le
  phénomène « Crues » — une alerte au vent qui emprunterait le nom d'une rivière
  serait deux bulletins imprimés comme un seul. Et si la couche Vigicrues est
  éteinte, l'étiquette redevient exactement ce qu'elle était.

- **Une borne de recharge dit enfin ce qui est libre, ici, maintenant.**
  QualiCharge — l'API d'agrégation de la DGEC, obligatoire pour tout opérateur
  de recharge rapide qui réclame des certificats d'électricité renouvelable —
  publie l'état en direct de **75 584 points de charge**. Le dépôt le décodait
  depuis le 7 septembre, avec ses trois pièges mesurés, et ne s'en servait que
  pour la chronique : la couche IRVE, elle, répétait trois fois qu'elle ne
  publie pas la disponibilité.

  **Les deux ne pouvaient pas se rencontrer, et le plan disait pourquoi.**
  QualiCharge se joint sur `id_pdc_itinerance` et ne publie **aucune
  coordonnée** ; la requête de vue de la couche IRVE **groupe** ses lignes pour
  être payable — 4 017 points de charge du centre de Paris tiennent en 469
  lignes groupées — et exclut donc tout identifiant par borne. Aucun des deux
  n'avait la clé de l'autre.

  La table manquante existe : un export à plat de trois colonnes du fichier
  consolidé, **227 007 lignes, 8,4 Mo, 17 s**. C'est une passe nationale, donc
  elle est construite une fois côté serveur, gardée sur disque et rafraîchie au
  rythme quotidien du registre qu'elle lit. **99,6 % des bornes de QualiCharge y
  figurent.**

  **Un piège en chemin : 9,34 % des identifiants de borne désignent plus d'un
  endroit.** Les 227 007 lignes ne portent que 166 908 identifiants distincts,
  et 15 594 sont publiés à plusieurs coordonnées — dont l'identifiant littéral
  `Non concerné`, à 117 coordonnées réparties sur 7 302 km. Une borne dont les
  coordonnées se contredisent de plus de **50 m** est donc **refusée** plutôt
  que posée sur l'une d'elles : l'unité de rendu de la couche est la coordonnée,
  deux points à 200 m sont deux marques sur la carte, et poser l'état d'une
  borne sur l'une des deux est un tirage au sort imprimé comme un fait. Le coût
  est mesuré, pas supposé : 92,4 % des bornes de QualiCharge se joignent quand
  même.

  **Ce qui n'a pas changé : la carte.** Elle dessine toujours la capacité
  installée, sans couleur de disponibilité — c'est un contrat écrit dans
  `irveFeed.js` et il tient. Ce qui change est **une ligne sur la carte d'un
  site**, qui porte sa source, son dénominateur et son âge : `QualiCharge — 26
  libres sur 30 · 1 hors service · 188 muettes · relevé il y a 8 min`. Le
  dénominateur est ce dont le flux a parlé, jamais ce qui est installé, et une
  borne muette depuis plus de 24 h est comptée comme muette, jamais comme libre
  — c'est le piège qui gonfle de 44,4 % la capacité libre de la France, appliqué
  parking par parking.

  Le fichier n'est **pas** interrogé en boucle : la route `/api/irve-fr/live`
  le récupère à la demande, quand un lecteur a la couche allumée, et garde la
  réponse dix minutes. Une session qui n'ouvre jamais une borne ne coûte rien.

- **Un aéroport dit enfin ce qui lui arrive, sans qu'on ait rien cliqué.** La
  ligne « en approche » d'une carte d'aérodrome lisait les trajets des vols, et
  les trajets n'étaient demandés que pour **le vol suivi** — un avion à la fois.
  Une session fraîche répondait donc `0/0` pour tous les aérodromes du monde
  jusqu'à ce qu'un lecteur suive par hasard un avion vers celui qu'il regardait.
  La flotte à l'écran est désormais enrichie elle aussi.

  **Le blocage était de ne pas savoir combien ça coûte, alors on l'a mesuré.**
  `npm run qa:enrich-budget` compte maintenant les deux demandes sur une même
  passe et une même flotte, parce que ce ne sont pas les mêmes flottes : une
  recherche de TYPE se fait sur l'adresse hexadécimale — tout contact en vol est
  demandeur — tandis qu'une recherche de TRAJET se fait sur l'INDICATIF, et seul
  un indicatif de compagnie peut aboutir. Mesuré le 2026-09-09, 26 relevés sur
  14,6 minutes : Paris **726 contacts en vol pour 573 indicatifs de compagnie**
  (79 %) et 72 nouveaux par 5 minutes ; Los Angeles 511 / 222 et 22. Et le
  **rendement** compte autant que la demande : **30 indicatifs sur 40 (75 %)**
  donnent une route chez adsbdb, et les 30 portent toutes les coordonnées de
  l'arrivée.

  D'où un **second seau de jetons**, 600 de plafond et 100 de recharge, et non
  un partage de celui des types. Ce que voit adsbdb ne bouge pas : c'est le
  goutte-à-goutte partagé qui borne le débit (≤ 5 req/s contre une limite de
  512 par minute), pas les seaux — ils bornent le TOTAL d'une session.

  Au passage, le harnais comparait encore ses mesures au plafond de **300**,
  alors que celui-ci était passé à 1 000 quatre jours plus tôt : il affichait
  donc « le plafond NE COUVRE PAS la première vue » à propos d'un plafond qui la
  couvrait. Corrigé.

- **Un navire dit où il va, et la carte sait nommer deux fois plus de ces
  endroits — 50,4 % → 68,9 %.** Le champ `destination` d'un message AIS est
  vingt caractères tapés à la main par un commandant. Il était résolu contre les
  2 951 escales du World Port Index, et l'audit de septembre avait écrit ce
  qu'était l'autre moitié : des **ports fluviaux** (`MAINZ`, `PARIS`,
  `FRANKFURT`, `KARLSRUHE`, `DUISBURG`) que le WPI n'indexe pas parce qu'il
  indexe des ports **maritimes**, et des **exonymes** (`ANTWERP` pour
  `Antwerpen`, `GENOA` pour `Genova`). Les deux demandaient la même chose : une
  table de noms **avec une source**.

  `scripts/build-port-gazetteer.mjs` la fabrique à partir de trois registres, et
  aucun ne fait plus que ce pour quoi il est cité. **UN/LOCODE** (UNECE, domaine
  public ODC-PDDL) décide *ce qui est un port* — code de fonction `1`, que les
  ports fluviaux portent exactement comme les maritimes — et fournit 11 545
  lieux absents du WPI, plus sa propre liste d'alias. **GeoNames** (CC BY 4.0)
  ne sert qu'à *compléter* une ligne déjà choisie par UN/LOCODE : une coordonnée
  pour les 4 791 ports dont la colonne est vide (`Mainz`, `Karlsruhe`,
  `Portsmouth`), et les autres graphies d'une ville rattachée à un port **par le
  nom ET par la distance** (≤ 25 km). 13 657 graphies au total. Toujours aucune
  distance d'édition nulle part : deux chaînes se replient sur la même clé, ou
  elles ne se rencontrent pas.

  **Un nom qui s'accorde de loin est refusé plus durement qu'avant.** Le
  plafond de 2 500 km du WPI avait été mesuré sur 2 951 grandes escales ; le
  gazetteer en compte quatre fois plus et ce sont des noms de lieux ordinaires
  — `Stein`, `Beaulieu`, `Workum`. Sur le même échantillon de 1 924 navires, les
  correspondances se séparent aussi nettement que les premières : **268 bonnes
  de 0 à 415 km** (une péniche est loin de sa destination parce qu'un fleuve est
  long), un trou, puis **9 mauvaises à partir de 622 km**. Le plafond du
  gazetteer est donc à **500 km**, dans le trou, et il est appliqué **par
  entrée** : un lieu du gazetteer hors de portée ne masque pas une escale du WPI
  qui, elle, est dans la sienne.

  Trouvé en chemin : `København` se repliait sur `K BENHAVN`. La normalisation
  Unicode sépare `Ê` en `E` + accent, mais elle ne touche pas les lettres dont
  le signe fait partie du dessin — `ø`, `æ`, `ß`, `þ`, `ł`. **174 noms** du
  gazetteer se repliaient sur une clé trouée et ne pouvaient rencontrer aucune
  saisie. `npm run qa:vessel-destinations` mesure le recensement complet.

- **« Paris, mardi 8 h » est devenu un geste — les trois couches de semaine type
  partagent une heure.** Trois couches de ce dépôt ne dessinent pas une mesure
  en direct mais une **semaine archivée type** : les comptages routiers de Paris
  (2 977 arcs × 168 heures), le pouls vélo (561 stations × 168 heures) et la
  fréquence IDFM (36 502 arrêts × 7 jours × 24 tranches). Depuis la fusion elles
  vivent sur **trois lignes différentes** du panneau, donc en voir deux à la fois
  est le cas normal — et jusqu'ici ce cas dessinait **deux heures différentes de
  la semaine côte à côte**. Comparer la pointe du matin sur la route et la pointe
  du matin dans le métro revenait à comparer 8 h avec l'heure qu'il était.

  Un curseur unique (`src/data/weekHourCursor.js`) tient désormais « l'heure de
  la semaine type », et chacune des trois la traduit dans **son** vocabulaire
  sans jamais importer les autres : la position 0–167 du pouls, la tranche
  d'exploitation 4–27 d'IDFM — où 01 h du mercredi est la tranche 25 du mardi —
  et le *jour ouvré type* / *week-end type* des comptages. Presser une heure sur
  n'importe laquelle des trois lignes déplace les deux autres.

  **Ce qui ne se propage pas, et pourquoi.** « À cette heure » et « Maintenant »
  *libèrent* le curseur au lieu de le poser : ce sont des comportements (suivre
  l'horloge de Paris), pas des positions, et épingler les autres couches sur
  l'heure qu'il est par hasard les figerait sur un moment que personne n'a
  choisi. La semaine du pouls **en train de défiler** ne diffuse rien non plus :
  168 heures à une toutes les 0,5 s repeindraient 2 977 arcs deux fois par
  seconde pour une lecture que personne n'a demandée. En pause, elle diffuse.

  **Et le lien porte enfin l'heure.** `wh` est la première clé de partage
  capable d'exprimer « mardi 8 h ». Ce point était noté comme bloqué par la
  grammaire de partage — « les trois encodent leur heure séparément et des liens
  déjà envoyés en dépendent » : c'était faux, et le vérifier est ce qui a rendu
  le module petit. Dans `layerState.js`, `comptages-fr` et `idfm-frequency` sont
  `enabled-only` — **aucune des deux n'a jamais mis son heure dans un lien** —
  et `velo-pulse-fr` encode un mode à trois valeurs, pas une heure. Il n'y avait
  donc rien à préserver, et la décision est l'inverse de celle qui était
  attendue : **un jeton partagé, pas trois**. Une clé absente reste le défaut —
  un lien ne fige jamais un lecteur sur mardi 8 h par accident.

  33 tests neufs, dont un qui parcourt les 168 heures dans les trois dialectes
  et vérifie qu'aucune traduction ne perd une heure au passage.

- **Une petite centrale hydro dit enfin l'eau qui passe et l'ouvrage à côté.**
  ODRÉ publie une puissance installée et jamais le débit ; il publie une hauteur
  de chute et jamais l'ouvrage qui retient l'eau. Hub'Eau mesure le premier à
  quelques kilomètres et le paquet OSM a cartographié le second — et jusqu'ici
  aucune des trois couches ne pouvait atteindre les autres.

  La carte d'une centrale porte maintenant, quand les couches voisines sont
  allumées : `≋ 560 m³/s à 2,7 km — station Le Rhône à Tarascon sur Le Rhône,
  la plus proche qui mesure un débit` et `▰ Barrage de Saint-Nicolas à 1,2 km —
  ouvrage voisin cartographié, aucun registre ne le relie à cette centrale`.

  **Les deux lignes sont des VOISINAGES et le disent.** Rien dans les registres
  ne relie une station ou un ouvrage à une centrale, donc la ligne nomme la
  rivière pour qu'on puisse vérifier, donne la distance, et ne dit jamais
  « son barrage ». Et c'est un DÉBIT ou rien : une hauteur d'eau est mesurée
  au-dessus d'un zéro d'échelle propre à sa station — le module Hub'Eau consacre
  un paragraphe à expliquer que deux hauteurs ne se comparent pas — donc une
  station qui ne publie qu'une hauteur n'est jamais retenue, si proche soit-elle.

  Le paquet des barrages préfère un ouvrage NOMMÉ à un seuil anonyme plus
  proche : 4 579 de ses 6 189 entités n'ont ni nom, ni hauteur, ni exploitant.
  Un anonyme reste une réponse quand c'est tout ce qu'il y a — « il y a quelque
  chose ici et OSM ne sait pas quoi » est un fait.

- **Un vol suivi dit ce qu'il lui reste à faire, et un aéroport dit ce qui lui
  arrive.** Deux lignes, deux moitiés du même croisement.

  La ligne de trajet du contact suivi affichait `AUS → LAX` et rien de plus.
  adsbdb publie les **coordonnées** de l'origine et de la destination depuis que
  ce proxy existe, et seule l'arche les lisait : la lecture, jamais. Elle
  affiche maintenant `AUS → LAX · 1 994 km`, mesuré depuis la position même que
  la garde de plausibilité utilise, et rien du tout quand adsbdb n'a publié
  aucune coordonnée — une distance ne se devine pas.

  Et la carte d'un aéroport nomme ce qui vole vers lui : `1 en approche —
  TVF57PQ`. Le paquet dessine 7 466 terrains et ne sait rien du ciel au-dessus ;
  la couche des vols tient une flotte dont les trajets nomment ces terrains par
  code. Aucune des deux ne pouvait atteindre l'autre sans un arc d'import, ce
  que `layerJoins.js` supprime.

  **Ce que ce compte voit, et ce qu'il ne voit pas**, dit parce que le plafond
  est bas aujourd'hui : la résolution de trajet ne se déclenche que pour le
  contact SUIVI, un avion à la fois. Une session fraîche répond donc 0 partout,
  et la ligne se remplit à mesure qu'on suit des vols. C'est un compte de ce que
  **cette session a résolu**, jamais un tableau des départs — et l'élargir veut
  dire toucher à un seau de jetons dimensionné par mesure contre les recherches
  de TYPE (`npm run qa:enrich-budget`), ce qui est une décision mesurée à part,
  pas l'effet de bord d'une ligne de carte.

- **Un navire dit où il va : la carte le résout en port, et dit dans quelle mer
  il est.** Le message AIS porte une destination de vingt caractères tapée à la
  main, et la carte l'affichait telle quelle depuis toujours — `→ BEANR`,
  `→ IT GOA`, `→ HARBOUR TOWAGE` — pendant que 2 951 ports du World Port Index
  étaient dessinés une ligne plus bas, sans que les deux se soient jamais
  parlé. Depuis la fusion, c'est la **même ligne**, ce qui est précisément ce
  qui rend la jointure atteignable sans demander d'allumer une seconde couche.

  Mesuré le 2026-09-09 sur **2 250 navires** distincts, relevés sur douze
  instantanés consécutifs de l'abonnement AIS : **1 137, soit 50,5 %**, nomment
  un port du paquet — 523 par code UN/LOCODE, 614 par nom. La moitié restante
  n'est pas du bruit à rapprocher de force, c'est un recensement de ce à quoi
  le champ sert : des ports fluviaux que le World Port Index ne liste pas
  (`MAINZ`, `PARIS`, `DUISBURG`), des exonymes (`ANTWERP` contre `Antwerpen`,
  `GENOA` contre `Genova`), des ordres qui ne sont pas des lieux
  (`HARBOUR TOWAGE`, `FOR ORDERS`), et des postes à quai. Tout cela reste
  imprimé **mot pour mot** comme le commandant l'a tapé.

  Aucun rapprochement flou : un code, un trajet (`DOVER<=>CALAIS` → Calais), un
  nom, ou un nom suivi d'un poste que le champ coupe à vingt caractères
  (`ANTWERPEN 4E HAVENDO` → Antwerpen). Deux ports du même nom sont départagés
  par la distance au navire ; et une correspondance **par nom** est refusée
  au-delà de 2 500 km, un seuil mesuré : dans l'échantillon, les 16 bonnes
  correspondances vont de 301 à 1 348 km, puis plus rien jusqu'à 5 006 km où
  commencent les 18 mauvaises — six navires de la Manche écrivant `PORTLAND`
  renvoyés dans l'Oregon, six écrivant `PORTSMOUTH` renvoyés dans le
  New Hampshire.

  Et la carte dit enfin dans quelle mer le navire se trouve : `MER SLIGHT ·
  1 m · bouée 62170 à 128 km`, lue sur la bouée la plus proche **qui mesure
  vraiment la houle** — quatre cinquièmes du réseau NDBC n'a pas de capteur de
  vagues, et compter ces stations-là aurait répondu « mer calme, 0 m » pour la
  moitié de l'océan.

  Les deux lignes sont **facultatives par construction** : un lecteur qui a
  éteint les ports ou les bouées retrouve exactement la carte d'avant.
  `src/data/layerJoins.js` est le tableau d'affichage qui rend ça possible —
  une couche offre un fait, une autre le lit, aucune des deux ne s'importe.

- **Une porte du globe vers la radiographie d'adresse.** Le dépôt avait deux
  surfaces qui répondent à la même question sur la même porte, et aucun lien
  entre elles : la carte de la `Fiche implantation`, plafonnée à **six lignes**
  — le bon plafond pour une étiquette posée sur une porte — et `fiche.html`,
  qui en tient soixante, imprimable, et qu'on ne pouvait atteindre qu'en tapant
  son URL. La seconde a été écrite pour la première et rien ne pointait vers
  elle.

  La ligne `Zone de chalandise` porte désormais une pastille
  **RADIOGRAPHIE** : elle ouvre la feuille dans un panneau déplaçable, sur le
  point que le globe scanne, avec un bouton pour l'ouvrir en onglet et un
  autre pour l'imprimer en PDF. Le panneau encadre la page que l'application
  sert déjà (`?embed=1`, un mode que la feuille avait livré exprès pour ça) :
  pas de second rendu à maintenir, et le PDF reste celui qui s'imprime.

- **La radiographie répond enfin aux deux moitiés qui lui manquaient.**
  `Nuisances` imprimait l'air et jamais l'avion ; `Numérique` imprimait le
  câble et jamais le mât — sa propre note se terminait par « débits filaires
  uniquement ». Les deux routes étaient en production depuis des mois pour les
  couches du globe. Elles rejoignent la thématique qui existait déjà plutôt que
  d'en fonder deux de plus.

  · **Bruit** : la zone du PEB ou du PGS sous le point, avec son indice, sa
    plage et la date de son arrêté ; hors de tout plan, l'aérodrome le plus
    proche et sa distance. Une bande dessinée « autour » d'un aérodrome, que
    rien n'a testée contre un point, n'atteint jamais la feuille.
  · **Antennes** : les supports ANFR autour de l'adresse, comptés par
    génération, et seulement ce qui **rayonne** — un support autorisé mais pas
    en service est compté à part, jamais avec.

  Et une honnêteté qui a servi tout de suite : mesuré le 2026-09-09, le CSV de
  l'observatoire ANFR publié le 2026-09-03 fait **222 octets** — son en-tête et
  rien d'autre, contre 181 988 412 octets et 826 418 lignes le 2026-08-27. La
  feuille écrit « le registre ANFR est vide dans cette édition » au lieu de
  « 0 support » : une panne amont ne doit pas se lire comme un fait sur la rue
  de quelqu'un.

- **Coller une clé dans l'application, au lieu d'éditer un fichier.** Une
  pastille « POWER UP » apparaît en bas à droite quand il manque des clés ;
  elle ouvre un panneau qui liste les onze fournisseurs, ce que chacun allume,
  où obtenir la clé, et un champ pour la coller. L'enregistrement écrit dans le
  `.env` du dépôt et redémarre le serveur — la page se recharge d'elle-même et
  la couche est allumée. Plus aucun fichier à éditer à la main.

  **Ce qu'il ne fait pas, délibérément.** Une clé venue d'ailleurs — une
  variable exportée dans le shell, le trousseau macOS — s'affiche comme
  configurée et **ne peut être ni remplacée ni supprimée** : le panneau
  écrirait dans un fichier que le prochain démarrage ignorerait, ce qui aurait
  l'air d'avoir marché. `dev-fresh.sh` transmet désormais la liste des NOMS
  qu'il a résolus ailleurs (jamais les valeurs) pour que le serveur puisse le
  dire même quand les deux sources contiennent les mêmes octets.

  **Où il n'existe pas.** Les points d'entrée ne sont montés que par le serveur
  de développement : absents de `vite preview`, donc absents de tout ce qu'un
  déploiement sert — c'est vérifié en navigateur, la pastille et le panneau
  sont **retirés du DOM**. Et le portier refuse ce qui n'est pas cette
  machine : une requête portant un en-tête de proxy (`cf-connecting-ip`,
  `x-forwarded-for`), un `Host` étranger, une origine croisée, un POST sans
  origine exacte. Le fichier écrit reste en `-rw-------`, et il est remplacé
  atomiquement : rien d'autre dans le `.env` n'est touché.

  La liste des clés vit à un seul endroit (`src/keySetupCore.mjs`) : le
  panneau, le serveur, le diagnostic et le gabarit Pinokio la lisent tous, et
  un test échoue si l'un d'eux dérive.

- **`npm run doctor` — ce qui est configuré, et ce que ça donne.** Un
  diagnostic hors ligne : version de Node, npm, dépendances, puis une ligne par
  fournisseur avec **d'où** vient la valeur (shell, `.env`, trousseau) et
  jamais la valeur elle-même. Il dit surtout ce que l'application fait **sans**
  la clé — le parc de 171 groupes RTE se dessine sans identifiants, la
  vigilance passe par le miroir data.gouv.fr — au lieu de n'énumérer que des
  manques. Sur un compte Google facturé dans l'EEE, il dit que la clé donne
  Plan et Relief mais pas le globe 3D, et qu'un jeton Cesium ion est la voie
  qui marche depuis la France.

- **Installation en un clic (Pinokio).** Le dossier `pinokio/` et les scripts
  qui vont avec : installation, démarrage, mise à jour, réinitialisation, pour
  une machine sans terminal. Le lanceur refuse de démarrer si le partage est
  activé — la version courante de Pinokio journalise les codes de connexion des
  tunnels réussis.

- **Une intégration continue.** Le dépôt n'en avait aucune : `npm test` n'était
  vert que sur la machine qui écrivait le changement. Tests et build sur
  Node 24.14 et 26, plus un poste Windows qui joue le chemin d'installation
  Pinokio — la seule plateforme où les permissions du fichier de clés reposent
  sur une ACL et non sur un bit de mode.

  **Son premier passage a trouvé un test faux.** `slotForMode` est vérifié avec
  une date construite en heure locale de la machine ; le créneau, lui, est
  toujours à l'heure de Paris — les jeux de données sont français. La même
  ligne signifiait donc mardi 8 h à Paris sur un portable français et mardi
  10 h sur un exécutant en UTC. La date est désormais écrite avec son décalage
  (`2026-06-02T08:00:00+02:00`), et la suite passe de l'UTC à UTC+14.
- **Un mode « Lite » pour les petits ordinateurs — même carte, mêmes données,
  moins de pixels à peindre.** L'application décide maintenant, avant même de
  construire le globe, si la machine qui l'ouvre est un poste de travail ou un
  portable de 2018. Sur un petit ordinateur elle demande **un échantillon par
  pixel au lieu de quatre**, laisse tomber la passe de netteté, cesse de garder
  une copie de chaque image, et rend à **80 % de la résolution pendant que la
  caméra bouge** — jamais à l'arrêt. Mesuré sur un vrai GPU, un levier à la
  fois : les deux premiers coûtent à eux seuls **un tiers du travail de rendu
  par image** à 1366×768, et **près des deux tiers** dès que l'écran demande
  quatre fois plus de pixels.

  Ce que le mode léger ne fait **pas** : il ne retire pas une couche, pas une
  donnée, pas un libellé. La liste des couches, leurs états, les lignes du
  panneau et la détection sont identiques dans les deux modes, et
  `npm run qa:perf-profile` échoue si un jour ce n'est plus vrai.

  Il demande aussi **moins de tuiles** : sur une ouverture à Paris, 245 requêtes
  et 5,48 Mo deviennent **212 et 5,04 Mo**, et une fois la caméra posée le trafic
  résiduel tombe de 81 requêtes à **43**. C'est le seul des cinq réglages qui
  rende des octets, et sur une ligne à 10 Mbit/s c'est celui qui se sent.

  Il se décide tout seul (nombre de cœurs, mémoire, nom de la puce graphique,
  préférence système « réduire les animations »), il se mesure — l'application
  chronomètre ses propres images et retient le verdict pour la prochaine
  visite — et il se débraye : un interrupteur **Lite** dans le panneau DISPLAY,
  ou `?perf=lite` / `?perf=full` dans l'adresse. Le choix reste sur la machine
  de celui qui l'a fait : il n'entre **jamais** dans un lien de partage.

### Fixed
- **Le chrome qui s'anime n'achète plus une image par battement.** Un élément
  d'interface qui annonce un déplacement — un panneau qui change de classe, une
  puce qui apparaît — demandait une image à chaque annonce, alors que la
  disposition, elle, n'est recalculée que dix fois par seconde. Un élément animé
  à 60 Hz achetait donc soixante images par seconde pour dix recalculs utiles.
  Et une annonce qui aboutit aux **mêmes rectangles** ne relance plus le
  placement des libellés du tout.

  Rien ne l'exploitait au moment du correctif : la source de ce bruit — le HUD
  qui retapait la même phrase toutes les quinze secondes — a été retirée le
  matin même. C'est un verrou, pas une réparation : le prochain élément qui
  s'animera en boucle ne pourra plus empêcher la scène de s'arrêter de dessiner.

### Changed
- **La légende des aéroports ne récite plus les longueurs de piste.** Le bloc de
  droite portait dix lignes pour une seule couche : les trois tiers, puis quatre
  classes de longueur, l'anneau « longueur non publiée », la piste tracée et
  l'emprise IGN. Quatre de ces lignes répétaient **la même** explication de
  40 mots, pour rappeler des seuils (1 000, 1 800, 3 000 m) que personne ne
  relit sur un disque de 13 px. Il en reste **cinq**, et le diamètre garde ce
  qu'il sait vraiment dire : l'**ordre** — Roissy écrase la piste en herbe d'à
  côté sans qu'une clé ait à l'annoncer.

  **La mesure n'est pas perdue, elle est là où elle se lit.** La fiche qui
  s'ouvre au clic dit toujours `Grand aéroport · piste 4 215 m revêtue`, avec le
  revêtement, sur le terrain que le lecteur vient de désigner — le seul endroit
  où une quantité de ce genre est lisible. Les seuils restent gelés et
  documentés dans le paquet ; ils ne sont simplement plus imprimés à l'écran.

  Les deux lignes que la légende garde nomment des **formes dessinées** :
  « Piste tracée » (4 790 terrains) et « Emprise au sol » (418). Un trait au cap
  et à la longueur vrais, un contour levé par l'IGN — rien d'autre à l'écran ne
  peut dire au lecteur que les deux tiers seulement du paquet en portent un.

- **Une centrale, une marque : les 69 stations que deux registres se partagent
  ne sont plus dessinées deux fois.** Trois couches dessinent la production
  électrique française et elles se recouvrent lourdement : `edf-power-plants`
  79 sites, `rte-generation` 108, `fr-hydro-plants` 998 placés. **69 des 108
  stations RTE sont un site EDF**, et **55 centrales hydro sont un groupe RTE**
  — dont 43 remontent jusqu'à un site EDF. Grand-Maison était dessinée trois
  fois.

  L'audit appelait le correctif « une colonne vertébrale à écrire (choisir
  quelle source fait foi pour la position, laquelle pour la puissance) ». La
  colonne vertébrale existait déjà, écrite par les scripts de fabrication du
  dépôt lui-même : `build-rte-units-registry.mjs` pose 69 de ses 108 stations
  sur la coordonnée publiée par EDF **et note laquelle** (`placementRef:
  'edf:nucleaire:GRAVELINES'`). La question de la position était donc tranchée,
  en faveur d'EDF, depuis la fabrication. Le second lien est le **code EIC**,
  que les deux paquets ODRÉ portent l'un et l'autre.

  **Aucune règle de proximité nulle part**, et la mesure explique pourquoi : la
  Grand-Maison d'EDF (1 714 MW) est à **540 m** du Verney du registre hydro
  (21,8 MW), et Super-Bissorte à 410 m d'Orelle. Ce sont des ouvrages
  différents sur la même montagne. Une règle d'identité à 1 km aurait fusionné
  80 paires dont plusieurs sont deux centrales, et la carte aurait perdu de la
  capacité réelle contre un point plus propre.

  **Rien n'est supprimé.** Une couche qui se retire ne dessine pas la marque ;
  l'enregistrement reste, le compte de la ligne dit ce qui est dessiné **et**
  combien sont laissés à la couche voisine, et la marque revient dès que
  celle-ci s'éteint.

  La carte qui survit gagne ce que le retrait aurait masqué : **la puissance de
  l'autre registre, quand les deux ne sont pas d'accord**. Sur les 69 paires,
  **43 s'accordent au mégawatt près** et 14 de plus à moins de 5 % — les taire
  est ce qui rend les 12 restantes lisibles. Et celles-là sont des trouvailles :
  Flamanville, 2 660 MW chez EDF contre 4 280 chez RTE, c'est l'EPR ; Bouchain,
  585 contre 1 063 ; Brennilis, 304 contre 125.

- **Un cabinet, un point : la famille « médecin » d'Équipements se retire quand
  la couche Médecins dessine.** `amenities-fr` dessine la BPE D265 — 61 263
  lignes « médecin généraliste » — et `medecins-fr` dessine le registre
  conventionné, 64 232 adresses avec les noms, les spécialités et le secteur.
  Le même cabinet, deux fois. La couche Équipements applique déjà la règle qui
  tranche — **un seul registre par famille**, ce qui lui fait refuser tout le
  domaine enseignement de la BPE au profit de `schools-fr` — et l'audit avait
  noté qu'elle devait le même retrait ici.

  **Rien n'est supprimé pour le payer.** Le point était classé bloqué parce que
  `AMENITY_FAMILIES` **est une clé de cache** : le maillage stocke une famille
  par son INDEX dans ce tableau, donc en retirer un renomme silencieusement
  chaque ligne de chaque paquet en cache et force une reconstruction nationale.
  Tout cela est vrai — et c'est le prix de la **suppression**. Ne pas dessiner
  la famille pendant qu'une autre couche le fait ne coûte rien : le tableau ne
  bouge pas, les paquets non plus, et un lecteur qui n'ouvre jamais la ligne
  Médecins garde tous les médecins que cette couche a toujours dessinés.

  Le retrait ne vaut que quand `medecins-fr` dessine des **positions** : à
  l'échelle nationale cette couche peint un aplat d'accessibilité (APL) et ne
  dessine aucun cabinet — s'y retirer aurait ôté les médecins de la carte au
  lieu de les dédoublonner. Et la légende gagne une ligne qui dit où ils sont
  passés, comme celle des écoles juste en dessous.

- **Le moteur 3D ne pèse plus que ce que cette carte utilise — 1,3 seconde de
  moins pour ouvrir le globe, et 460 kB de moins sur le fil.** Cesium arrivait
  en un seul bloc de **5,6 Mo** compilé d'avance : la bibliothèque entière,
  livrée à tout le monde, y compris les parties que cette application n'appelle
  jamais. Il passe désormais par le même chemin que le reste du code, ce qui
  permet à l'outil de fabrication de ne garder que ce qui est réellement
  appelé.

  | | Avant | Après |
  |---|---:|---:|
  | Moteur, non compressé | 5 593 kB | **3 945 kB** |
  | Moteur, sur le fil | 1 282 kB | **824 kB** |
  | JavaScript analysé avant le globe | 6 446 kB | **4 773 kB** |
  | Total sur le fil | 1 482 kB | **1 023 kB** |

  Mesuré en A/B alterné entre deux serveurs, portable simulé (CPU ÷4, 10 Mbit/s,
  cache vide) : ouvrir le globe passe de **3 655 ms [3 638–5 094] à 2 344 ms
  [2 298–2 826]**, et le poids de l'application de **1,78 à 1,34 Mo**. Les deux
  objectifs que ce chantier s'était donnés — moins de 1,8 Mo et moins de 3,5
  secondes sur un petit ordinateur — sont atteints.

  Deux conséquences à connaître. Le moteur reste un fichier séparé et
  cacheable un an, mais son empreinte dépend maintenant de ce que
  l'application utilise : une version qui appelle une fonction Cesium nouvelle
  fera retélécharger 824 kB à un visiteur qui revient, là où seule une montée
  de version du moteur le faisait avant. Et `window.Cesium`, qui n'existait que
  par accident de l'ancien format et jamais dans le serveur de développement,
  a disparu — douze harnais de test le lisaient et lisent désormais l'horloge
  et l'ellipsoïde de la scène, ce qui est plus juste de toute façon.

  Vérifié : `npm test` 6 644/6 644, `qa-perf` 24/24, `qa:lazy-voice` 8/8,
  `qa:lazy-layers` 9/9, `qa:starfield` 4/4, `qa:map-reload` 4/4,
  `qa:brotli` 17/17.

- **L'agent vocal n'est plus téléchargé pour ouvrir une carte — 281 kB de moins
  dans le paquet de démarrage.** Le micro, son moteur d'annotations, ses deux
  rendus et le réalisateur de scènes représentaient **604 kB** du code analysé
  avant le premier pixel, pour une fonction que la plupart des lecteurs
  n'utiliseront jamais. Le paquet principal passe de **1 134 à 853 kB**
  (334 → 248 kB compressés, **266 → 200 kB sur le fil**), et la fermeture
  statique du démarrage de 2 708 à **2 104 kB** sur 121 → 103 modules.

  **Le panneau du micro, lui, est là dès la première image.** Un bouton qui
  apparaît une seconde après le reste se lit comme une page encore en train de
  charger : seule sa mécanique est différée. Elle arrive toute seule dès que le
  navigateur souffle, ou immédiatement si quelqu'un tend la main vers le micro
  — clic, focus clavier, survol du panneau, touche Espace.

  Deux fils accidentels ont été coupés au passage, et c'est la moitié du gain :
  le bandeau du HUD tirait **164 kB** de machinerie vocale pour *une* fonction
  de contexte cartographique, et la barre de recherche **50 kB** de résolveur
  d'annotations pour deux helpers de géocodage. Les deux ne servent qu'après un
  geste ; ils se chargent maintenant avec le geste.

  Ce qui n'a pas changé et se mesure : `npm test` 6 647/6 647,
  `npm run qa:lazy-voice` 8/8 (le paquet d'entrée ne contient plus une seule
  empreinte vocale, le panneau est là au démarrage, la pile atterrit seule, et
  un outil vocal répond après coup), `qa:lazy-layers` 9/9.

  Honnêteté sur le chronomètre : **l'écart de temps n'a pas pu être mesuré
  aujourd'hui.** Ce Mac portait un autre agent (charge 8 à 21 pendant toute la
  passe) et deux tours d'A/B alternés n'ont rien séparé. Ce qui est certain est
  la taille, et une leçon qu'elle donne : le paquet de l'application ne fait
  plus que 853 kB en face des **5 593 kB de Cesium**. Le mur du démarrage
  n'est plus notre code.

- **Le code part compressé au maximum, et non plus au minimum que le serveur
  pouvait calculer à la volée — 460 kB de moins pour ouvrir le globe.** Le
  serveur compressait chaque fichier au moment où il le servait, en gzip, au
  niveau qu'il pouvait se permettre entre deux visiteurs. Or ces octets-là sont
  identiques à chaque visite : ils peuvent être compressés **une fois**, à la
  fabrication, aussi lentement qu'on veut.

  Mesuré sur le fil, à travers le serveur : le moteur 3D passe de **1 651 à
  1 282 kB**, le paquet principal de l'application de **326 à 266 kB**, la
  table des altitudes de terrain de 97 à 78 kB. Au total, ouvrir la carte
  coûte **2,23 → 1,77 Mo** — 21 % de moins, sur une mesure déterministe (même
  chiffre aux cinq démarrages). Les données des couches en profitent au même
  titre : le fichier des aérodromes passe de 611 à **429 kB**.

  Ce n'est pas quelque chose que l'hébergeur pouvait rattraper : Cloudflare
  transmet le gzip d'une origine tel quel plutôt que de le recompresser. Soit
  l'origine envoie du brotli, soit personne ne le fait.

  Une fabrication qui sauterait cette étape n'est pas cassée : elle retombe
  simplement sur le gzip à la volée d'avant. `npm run qa:brotli` vérifie sur
  socket que le corps décodé est bien identique à l'original, que le
  `Content-Length` annonce ce qui est envoyé, et qu'un client qui ne sait pas
  décoder le brotli n'en reçoit jamais.

- **Un sujet, une ligne : la liste des couches passe de 61 lignes à 38.** Le
  panneau listait quatorze sujets deux à quatre fois chacun. « Combien vaut ce
  sol » occupait trois lignes (`Ventes immobilières`, `Avis de valeur`,
  `Comparables`) qui lisent le même registre DVF. La route en occupait quatre.
  Les centrales, trois registres. L'enseignement, deux — la taxonomie écrivait
  déjà, à côté de `sup-fr`, « un sujet coupé en deux ministères, et la taxonomie
  ne devrait pas répéter la coupure » ; elle la répétait quand même, en deux
  lignes.

  Quinze fusions replient **23 couches** dans la ligne du sujet auquel elles
  appartiennent. Chacune devient une **pastille** sous cette ligne : ronde et
  pointée, pour la distinguer des pastilles d'option carrées qui existaient
  déjà. Allumer la ligne allume le sujet entier ; la pastille permet de le
  reprendre en main morceau par morceau.

  **Rien n'est supprimé.** Aucun module, aucune source, aucun jeton de partage :
  un lien envoyé avant la fusion rallume exactement ce qu'il rallumait, et une
  couche rallumée seule par un lien garde une commande sur la ligne qui la
  porte. Les couches mondiales restent des couches mondiales — les câbles
  sous-marins, les ports, les bouées, les caméras publiques : quand une fusion
  mélange une couche mondiale et une couche française, c'est la mondiale qui
  garde la ligne, pour qu'aucun lecteur hors de France ne voie une pastille
  `FR` au-dessus de données qui le concernent.

  **La voix suit.** Nommer un sujet allume le sujet : « montre les transports en
  commun » n'allume plus `transit-fr` seul en laissant l'Île-de-France sans
  véhicule. Et le mot nu « météo » désigne désormais la ligne, pas la couche
  d'instruments qu'elle porte — « stations météo » atteint toujours les
  instruments.

  Ce que la fusion ne fait pas, et qui reste dû : dédoublonner les 56 centrales
  que trois registres se partagent, et retirer la famille « médecin » de
  `Équipements du quotidien`. La fusion est la première moitié de ce travail,
  pas son remplacement. `docs/PLAN-CROISEMENTS.md` liste les huit points restés
  dehors et l'obstacle de chacun.

- **Les 60 couches de données ne se téléchargent plus qu'au premier clic —
  470 kB de moins pour ouvrir le globe.** L'application chargeait le code des
  soixante couches avant d'afficher quoi que ce soit : la CCTV, l'AIS, le
  propagateur de satellites, les cinquante-sept autres. Toutes éteintes. Un
  lecteur qui ouvre la carte, regarde Paris et n'allume rien payait
  **4,7 Mo de JavaScript** pour des couches qu'il n'a pas demandées — les deux
  tiers de tout ce que le navigateur avait à analyser avant le premier
  pixel.

  Chaque couche s'annonce désormais par sa fiche d'identité — son nom, son
  icône, sa source, ce que le panneau dessine — et son code n'arrive qu'au
  basculement qui en a besoin. Rien ne change à l'écran : la liste est la
  même, dans le même ordre, et une couche déjà allumée puis éteinte puis
  rallumée ne se retélécharge pas.

  Mesuré sur un portable simulé (CPU ÷4, réseau 4g, médiane de 3 démarrages,
  contre une copie propre de `main` sur la même machine) : le poids de
  l'application passe de **2,68 à 2,21 Mo**, le paquet de code principal de
  **2 560 à 1 102 kB** (806 → 324 kB compressés), et l'ouverture du globe de
  **3,9 à 3,2 secondes**. Le démarrage ne demande plus que **deux** fichiers
  de code au lieu du bloc unique.

  La fiche d'identité de chaque couche est **générée depuis la couche
  elle-même** et re-vérifiée à chaque `npm test` : une couche renommée qui
  laisserait une vieille étiquette dans le panneau casse la suite au lieu de
  s'afficher.

- **Les étoiles quittent la carte et rejoignent le satellite — 1,7 seconde de
  moins pour ouvrir le globe.** Cesium fabriquait un ciel étoilé pour chaque
  session : six images du catalogue Tycho-2, **848 kB**, téléchargées à chaque
  démarrage à froid avant que personne ait rien regardé. Sur un portable à deux
  cœurs et 10 Mbit/s, les retirer fait passer l'ouverture de **5,3 s à 3,6 s**
  et le poids de l'application de 3,51 Mo à **2,67 Mo**. Ce n'était pas qu'une
  question d'octets : six JPEG de 1024 pixels se disputaient la bande passante
  et le décodage pendant le démarrage, et l'écart entre le meilleur et le pire
  démarrage tombe de 1,8 seconde à **63 millisecondes**.

  Les étoiles ne disparaissent pas, elles changent de place. Elles reviennent
  sur les fonds **photographiques** — Satellite, Bing Aerial, Google 3D — et
  restent absentes des fonds **dessinés** — Plan Google, Relief, OSM, Plan IGN.
  La règle est celle de l'image : sur un plan, la Terre est un schéma et le noir
  est un fond ; sur une photo, elle est vue depuis l'orbite et le ciel fait
  partie de la même image. Le chargement reste différé, donc même une session
  qui s'ouvre directement sur un fond satellite ne paie pas ces 848 kB pendant
  son démarrage.

- **La clé d'une couche est peinte une fois, sur la carte — plus deux fois.**
  Les mêmes entrées `{couleur, glyphe, libellé, compte}` étaient montées à deux
  endroits : sous la ligne de la couche dans `DATA LAYERS`, à gauche, et dans
  le bloc `LEGEND` du rail droit. Deux copies d'une même clé ne protègent rien
  — le lecteur doit les comparer pour découvrir que c'est la même liste — et la
  copie de gauche repoussait au passage la couche suivante hors du panneau : les
  sept familles des navires en direct occupaient à elles seules sept lignes
  au-dessus de `Bouées marines`. C'est le bloc sur la carte qui survit : il est
  lisible sans ouvrir de panneau, il rend le `blurb` de chaque entrée en
  **texte** au lieu d'un `title` réservé à la souris, et c'est celui que voit le
  destinataire d'un lien de partage (`ui.js`, `allowStored:
  !this._initialShareState`). La ligne de la couche garde ses **puces** — elles
  sont des commandes, pas une légende — et devient silencieuse quand elle n'en a
  aucune.
- **Cliquer un navire recule encore : plancher 12 km, facteur 2,68.** Le recul
  mesuré depuis la côte (livré la veille) partait de `2,2 × distance` avec un
  plancher à 8 km. Le facteur venait d'être choisi **sous** la garantie
  optique : au champ de 60° et au pitch −38°, une côte à distance D n'est dans
  le cadre depuis **toutes** les orientations qu'à partir de `2,68 × D`, et 2,2
  abandonnait délibérément le cas de la côte dans le dos pour un cadre qui « se
  lit comme une scène plutôt que comme une carte ». Demande de l'opérateur :
  la carte. 2,68 est donc désormais le facteur, et il n'est pas un second choix
  de goût — c'est là que l'optique pose la garantie. Le **plancher** compte
  davantage, car le trafic AIS français longe la côte et presque tout clic y
  tombe : 8 km tenaient un bassin portuaire, 12 km tiennent le bassin **et** la
  ville qui le nomme (~14 km de large, 4,5 km de sol derrière la cible). Mesuré
  sur les mêmes positions réelles : Le Havre à quai 8 → **12 km**, milieu du
  Pas-de-Calais 19,7 → **24 km**, large de Nice 34,8 → **42,4 km**, Ouessant et
  Gascogne inchangés au plafond de 45 km. Le plancher reste sous l'altitude où
  les coques à l'échelle réelle sont dessinées (7,4 km de hauteur caméra contre
  un seuil de 15,6 à 23,5 km selon la fenêtre), donc un navire au port garde sa
  coque : c'est le seul objet de la scène tracé à sa vraie taille, et un test
  épingle désormais cette marge.
- **Ouvrir la carte ne coûte plus rien à personne — ni des octets, ni une
  clé.** Deux mesures prises sur la machine que ce projet vise vraiment (un
  portable de 2018, CPU bridé ÷4, 10 Mbit/s) ont donné deux résultats que
  personne n'attendait à cet endroit.

  D'abord les **polices**. La page en tirait **410 kB** chez Google, dont
  **323 kB pour la police d'icônes complète** — 4 277 dessins — alors que
  l'interface en affiche **28**. Elles sont désormais servies depuis ce
  serveur, et l'ensemble d'icônes est réduit à ceux qui servent : **4,0 kB**.
  Trois feuilles de style bloquantes, sur deux domaines que le navigateur
  n'avait jamais résolus, deviennent une feuille de 1 kB déjà sur place. Total
  sur le fil : **410 kB → 92 kB**, et le poids de l'application avant la
  première tuile passe de **3,83 Mo à 3,51 Mo**. Effet de bord qui n'en est pas
  un : plus une seule requête vers Google au chargement, donc plus une seule
  adresse IP de lecteur envoyée là-bas avant qu'il ait consenti à quoi que ce
  soit (CJUE, 2022).

  Ensuite les **clés**. À la fin du vol d'introduction — six secondes après
  l'ouverture, avant que quiconque ait cliqué — la page passait **cinq appels
  facturés** : le résumé sémantique du HUD, une recherche de lieux Google, et
  trois géocodages inverses émis par le navigateur. Le déclencheur était le vol
  lui-même. Une page publique était donc une page que n'importe qui pouvait
  facturer en la rechargeant en boucle. Rien n'est plus demandé avant un vrai
  geste — un clic, une molette, une touche. En attendant, le bandeau affiche la
  ligne composée localement, qui est exactement celle vers laquelle le chemin
  IA se replie : le lecteur qui regarde sans toucher ne perd aucune
  information, et celui qui touche obtient la version complète sur-le-champ.

### Fixed
- **La carte jetait 19 emprises militaires sur 21.** La couche Installations
  militaires demande à OpenStreetMap `out center tags geom`. Overpass ne retient
  que le **dernier** mode de géométrie de la liste : `geom` gagne, et le point
  central `center` n'est jamais envoyé. Or c'était le seul point que le code
  savait lire. Chaque caserne, chaque terrain, chaque emprise dessinée comme une
  surface arrivait donc sans coordonnées et était écartée en silence — seuls
  survivaient les rares sites cartographiés comme un simple point.

  Mesuré le 9 septembre sur une vue de Strasbourg, avec la requête exacte de
  l'application : **21 objets renvoyés, 2 affichés**. Les 18 tracés et l'unique
  relation — la Caserne Stirn, le Quartier Lecourbe — n'apparaissaient nulle
  part, et la couche ne signalait rien : elle se déclarait à jour. Overpass
  accompagne ces objets de leur boîte englobante ; le centre de cette boîte les
  ramène tous, sans changer la requête ni le dessin des emprises. Une boîte
  incohérente — inversée, à cheval sur l'antiméridien, plus large que la vue
  autorisée — est toujours refusée plutôt que moyennée en un point plausible
  dans le mauvais océan.

- **Deux personnes demandant la même route au même instant recevaient deux
  réponses différentes.** Le serveur regroupe les requêtes Overpass identiques :
  la deuxième attend le résultat de la première au lieu de repartir vers les
  miroirs. Quand ce résultat était un refus — un `406` du pare-feu
  d'overpass-api.de, un `429` de quota — la première recevait bien les routes de
  la veille gardées en cache, mais la seconde recevait le refus brut. Le repli
  sur la dernière bonne réponse passe désormais par un seul chemin, quelle que
  soit la porte d'entrée. Au passage, une seule règle décide de ce qui mérite
  d'être gardé en cache, relu depuis le cache, et remplacé par une version
  périmée : ces trois décisions étaient trois comparaisons distinctes, et rien
  n'empêchait qu'elles divergent.

- **Un site militaire sélectionné ne pouvait plus être désélectionné.** Cliquer
  une emprise l'allumait et affichait sa fiche ; recliquer dessus, ou cliquer
  ailleurs sur la carte, ne faisait rien. Le seul moyen de s'en défaire était
  qu'une autre couche prenne la main. Un second clic la relâche maintenant, et
  seule la sélection de cette couche est effacée — l'avion qu'un autre clic
  vient de désigner n'est pas emporté avec elle. Symétriquement, un
  rafraîchissement tardif de la couche ne repeint plus son ancien site
  par-dessus une sélection plus récente venue d'ailleurs.

- **Sous le fond Satellite, la couche que personne ne voit coûtait une fois et
  demie celle qu'on regarde.** La pastille Satellite empile deux couches : le
  satellite mondial d'Esri, et l'orthophoto IGN par-dessus. Cesium télécharge la
  couche du dessous en entier même quand celle du dessus la masque
  complètement ; un garde-fou existait donc pour l'éteindre au-dessus de la
  France, mais il exigeait que la vue tienne dans **une seule** boîte de
  couverture, et les cinq boîtes étaient dessinées à la main. Résultat : au
  **tangage par défaut du cockpit** (−30°), Paris à 9 382 m couvrait
  1,88–2,70 E / 48,93–49,34 N — à cheval sur deux boîtes, donc dans aucune,
  alors que la zone est couverte 81 fois sur 81. Cette vue payait **69 requêtes
  et 1 362 ko d'Esri invisible** contre **41 requêtes et 927 ko d'IGN** à
  l'écran. Elle en paie maintenant **zéro** : l'imagerie de la vue tombe de
  2 285 ko à 927 ko, **−59 %**.

  Deux corrections, et une mesure qui en a tué une troisième. Le test de
  couverture teste désormais l'**union** des boîtes, exactement (il découpe la
  vue à chaque arête et vérifie chaque cellule), au lieu de l'appartenance à une
  seule. Et les boîtes ne sont plus dessinées : `npm run qa:ign-opaque-boxes`
  les **dérive** d'un balayage de 15 554 points sur la Géoplateforme, puis
  re-sonde chaque candidate au demi-pas décalé — 7 candidates sur 24 éliminées,
  les **17** retenues vérifiées sur ~17 100 points sans un seul manque. Sur un
  balayage de 15 400 positions de caméra, **30 à 37 % de vues supplémentaires**
  éteignent le fond. En revanche, remplacer `computeViewRectangle()` par un
  échantillonnage de l'écran n'aurait rien donné : mesuré, les deux coïncident
  exactement tant que l'horizon n'est pas dans le champ, et quand il l'est on
  voit vraiment 300 km, donc le fond est nécessaire.

  Au passage, **deux des cinq anciennes boîtes contenaient un vrai trou**
  (`0,5;44 → 5;49`, la plus grande, et `4,2;43,7 → 6;45`) : l'application
  éteignait le fond sur des vues où le globe n'avait rien à dessiner. Elles
  avaient passé un contrôle 9×9, soit un point tous les 0,56° sur une boîte de
  4,5°. Rien ne change hors de France ni sur le littoral, où le fond mondial est
  la seule image et doit continuer à se charger.

- **Une scène immobile ne s'arrêtait jamais de dessiner, et la cause était une
  phrase.** Le HUD retapait son résumé à la machine à écrire toutes les 15
  secondes **même quand le texte était identique** — ce qui est le cas normal
  dès que le service de résumé ne répond pas. Le texte qui grandit décalait la
  mise en page du coin supérieur gauche, et l'affichage traitait ce décalage
  comme du travail à peindre. Une carte posée, sans aucune couche, redessinait
  ainsi **15 fois par 5 secondes**, indéfiniment, sur la batterie de qui la
  laissait ouverte. Elle en fait **0**, et le contrôle de rendu
  (`scripts/qa-perf.mjs`) passe de **19/24 à 24/24** — la première fois depuis
  le mois d'août.

### Added
- **Les aéroports français sont posés sur leur sol.** La couche Aéroports
  dessinait un point et, quand la source mondiale l'avait géoréférencée, une
  piste. Elle dessine maintenant l'**emprise** que l'IGN lève dans la BD TOPO®
  — 418 terrains français, 41 859 ha, jointe au paquet OurAirports **sur le
  code OACI** (377 terrains) et, pour les 802 aéroclubs qui n'en ont aucun, sur
  le fait que leur point publié tombe **dans** un contour (41 de plus). Aucune
  ambiguïté à arbitrer : mesuré sur les 447 contours candidats, aucun n'est
  réclamé par deux terrains. **213 terrains gagnent une forme qu'ils n'avaient
  pas du tout**, dont 207 aéroclubs — OurAirports n'avait géoréférencé que 8 %
  d'entre eux (89 sur 1 127), et ce long tail est précisément la moitié de la
  couche qu'aucune source mondiale ne couvre. Le contour est **plaqué sur le
  relief**, d'une seule couleur pour les 418 (une primitive de sol groupée se
  colore par rectangle englobant, et la boîte de Marseille-Provence recouvre
  celle de l'hydrobase de Berre), et il a **son propre plancher d'écran** :
  sous 8 px d'étendue au sol il n'est plus dessiné et la marque redevient une
  pastille. La pastille, elle, ne bouge pas : elle reste sur le point de
  référence publié, celui dont chaque piste est mesurée — la recentrer sur le
  contour déplacerait 418 marques de 154 m en médiane et de 1 382 m au pire.
  La fiche gagne une ligne, « emprise IGN 2 832 ha », et elle **nomme sa
  source** : c'est la seule moitié de cette couche dont la licence exige une
  attribution.
- **Ce que ce contour ne dit pas, et qui est écrit noir sur blanc.** La BD TOPO
  s'arrête aux frontières françaises : Tahiti-Fa'a'ā, 1,89 M de passagers en
  2025, n'a pas de contour là où une bande d'herbe de l'Aveyron en a un. 61 %
  des 1 370 objets de la couche IGN ne sont pas des contours mais un **carré de
  5,2 m** — un point déguisé en polygone, y compris 147 objets que le fichier
  appelle « Aérodrome » — écartés par un plancher d'un hectare. 704 sont des
  **héliports** (hôpitaux, casernes, gendarmeries, 48 en Guyane) que ce paquet
  ne lit pas. Et **30 contours, 1 457 ha, ne se rattachent à rien** : la BD TOPO
  modélise le côté civil et le côté militaire d'un même terrain comme deux
  objets et ne met le code OACI que sur le civil. Le plus grand est la **base
  d'aéronautique navale de Lann Bihoué, 767 ha**, à 579 m de Lorient-Bretagne
  Sud avec qui elle partage sa piste. Les rattacher demanderait de deviner ;
  Lorient dessine son tablier civil, la base reste sombre, et c'est dit.
- **La sélection — on demande un sujet, on choisit le jeu soi-même.** Le champ
  de « brancher un jeu de données » prend désormais des mots autant qu'une
  adresse, et le bouton dit lequel il a lu : **CHERCHER** ou **ANALYSER**. Un
  sujet lit d'un coup les cinq premiers résultats de data.gouv.fr, ne propose
  que ceux dont un brouillon **valide** — donc dessinables, prouvés avant
  d'être offerts — et met sous chacun les quatre faits qui décident : combien
  d'objets, qui publie, quelle fraîcheur, quelle licence. Ce qui a été écarté
  est dit avec la raison en une phrase (« fichiers introuvables », « aucune
  colonne de position »). Rien n'est présélectionné ni étoilé : mesuré sur six
  sujets, le premier résultat de la plateforme est le bon **une fois sur
  deux**, et ses erreurs ressemblent à des succès — dix-neuf points d'un
  département là où une base nationale de 186 118 était visée. Le choix
  revient au lecteur parce qu'aucune machine n'a de quoi le faire à sa place.
- **Une barre de chargement qui ne ment pas.** Pendant qu'un jeu se charge, la
  ligne de statut annonce une fraction **exacte** — « 2 400 sur 5 000 » : la
  première page de l'API tabulaire donne le total, donc le dénominateur est
  connu dès la première réponse. Un temps restant s'y ajoute **seulement**
  après cinq pages, un cinquième du travail, et s'il reste plus de trois
  secondes — trois seuils mesurés, pas devinés : à deux pages l'extrapolation
  se trompe de 45 %, à un cinquième elle tombe à 9 %. Le chiffre est arrondi
  plus grossièrement que son erreur (« environ 30 secondes », par pas de 5).
  Le dernier mot n'est jamais une barre pleine mais la ligne de couverture de
  la couche — « 1 321 dans la vue », « 5 000 affichés sur 18 630 », ou
  « rien à cet endroit ». Une proposition est une promesse ; les marques sont
  la seule preuve. Les mesures et les règles sont dans
  `docs/DEMANDER-UNE-DONNEE.md`.
- **`list_layers` — la voix peut citer le registre au lieu de le deviner.** Le
  29ᵉ outil vocal rend « je n'ai pas cette couche » vérifiable : identifiant,
  libellé français, groupe, état et nombre d'objets chargés, filtrables par un
  sujet en français ou en anglais.
- **Des sous-titres sur le dock, et trois exemples en rotation.** Ce qui a été
  entendu et ce qui est dit restent lisibles après le tour : une erreur de
  reconnaissance se diagnostique sans réécouter. Au repos, le dock propose
  trois formulations parmi dix, tirées de la même liste que les instructions du
  modèle — une suggestion qu'il ne saurait pas honorer serait pire que rien.
- **`npm run qa:immobilier-voice` — la lecture immobilière est sous test.**
  Harnais navigateur déterministe, sans modèle et sans réseau : les deux
  endpoints sont tenus par des charges **enregistrées** sur le proxy de l'app
  place des Grands Hommes. Il prouve les quatre choses que le registre vivant
  ne peut pas fixer — la caméra qui descend toute seule (23 027 m → 516 m) et
  la couche qui dessine dans la foulée, le cadrage à 900 m sur la portée et non
  à 7 km sur le plafond, les médianes qui arrivent jusqu'à `layerSummaries`, et
  que ces médianes sont bien celles du proxy : la charge sert 12 ventes sur un
  scan de 372, donc un résumé recalculé sur ce qui est à l'écran tomberait à
  côté.
- **`npm run qa:voice-bench` — le banc français est dans le dépôt.** 154 cas de
  routage (les 26 historiques, 9 écrits pour ce rapport, et **les 59 couches ×
  2 formulations**, dérivées du registre) et 6 cas de lecture qui notent ce que
  le modèle **dit** d'un résultat d'outil. La configuration est lue dans
  `vite.config.js`, jamais copiée. Coût mesuré : ~0,0006 $ le cas.

### Changed
- **Les aéroports : quatre paliers qui posaient deux questions, un seul palier
  qui en pose une.** L'échelle d'importance croisait la classe de taille
  d'OurAirports et le service régulier, et lisait la taille **en premier**. Ses
  quatre marches changeaient donc de sujet à chaque descente — taille, service,
  taille — et elle asseyait Paris-Le Bourget, qui ne vend aucun billet, au
  sommet d'une échelle dont la puce **LIGNES** promettait « les terrains
  desservis par une ligne régulière » : 22 terrains dans le monde rendaient
  cette promesse fausse. L'échelle pose désormais **une** question, et c'est la
  dure — *un billet s'y vend-il ?* — puis laisse la politique de sélection
  séparer ce qui reste : *Aéroport de ligne* (4 326), *Aéroport sans ligne*
  (2 012, bases aériennes, aviation d'affaires, fret) et *Aérodrome & aéroclub*
  (1 126, français à 100 % par construction). La puce `GRANDS` disparaît : elle
  interrogeait la taille, que le diamètre dit déjà en mètres publiés — mesuré,
  la médiane de piste par classe OurAirports vaut 3 048 / 2 050 / 1 037 m, soit
  exactement les seuils du canal taille, si bien que la couleur repeignait ce
  que le diamètre disait mieux. Ce que l'ancien palier haut faisait seul, il le
  fait maintenant par terrain : **3 000 m de piste achètent la portée
  orbitale** — 1 280 terrains contre les 1 173 d'avant, dont 268 sans ligne
  qu'un globe n'avait aucune raison honnête de cacher pendant qu'il dessinait
  un aéroport régional à la piste plus courte. Un aéroclub, lui, n'y a jamais
  droit : son palier est français par sélection, et l'y faire monter
  dessinerait une densité qui appartient au paquet et non au monde.
- **Cliquer un navire : un recul mesuré depuis la côte, au lieu d'un plan serré
  sur la coque.** Le transfert de caméra se posait à **1 200 m** du contact :
  un cadre de ~1,4 km rempli d'eau, dans lequel un ferry du Pas-de-Calais et un
  chalutier au large de Sète sont la même image. Le recul se **calcule**
  désormais sur la distance du navire à la terre la plus proche, lue sur les
  contours IGN déjà embarqués (`local_data/france_departements/`, dont le bord
  maritime *est* le trait de côte dans l'emprise AIS France, Corse comprise) :
  `2,2 × distance`, plancher 8 km, plafond 45 km, pitch −38°. Le facteur sort
  de l'optique, pas du goût : au champ de 60° de Cesium en 16:9 et à ce pitch,
  le sol que le cadre tient à coup sûr autour de la cible vaut 0,37 × recul
  vers l'arrière et 0,58 sur les flancs. Mesuré sur des positions réelles — Le
  Havre à quai 8 km, milieu du Pas-de-Calais 19,7 km, large de Nice 34,4 km,
  Ouessant et Gascogne 45 km. Effet de bord voulu : sous 8 à 15 km de recul la
  caméra reste sous l'altitude des coques à l'échelle réelle, donc un navire au
  port garde sa coque quand un cargo au large passe en chevron. Le clic sur la
  **carte** du navire prend le même cadrage — c'était déjà le même chemin. Les
  contours (260 kB, déjà en cache pour cinq autres couches) se chargent en
  `requestIdleCallback` à l'activation, jamais dans le clic ; sans eux le clic
  tombe sur 20 km. Et non, ce n'est **pas** le port de départ : l'AIS donne une
  position, pas une trace, et une route antérieure à l'écoute n'est pas
  connaissable. Encadrer la côte est la version honnête de la même envie.
- **La clé AIS : sept lignes au lieu de seize.** Elle montait deux blocs — les
  familles de type, puis toute la rampe de taille : un en-tête, trois repères
  numérotés, la marque non mesurée et jusqu'à quatre déclarations d'écrêtage,
  chacune avec son paragraphe. Environ **1 800 caractères** de prose montés en
  permanence sur la carte, pour une couche dont le signal premier est une
  teinte à sept valeurs. Une clé qu'il faut faire défiler n'est pas lue, et une
  clé non lue ne protège rien. Reste la clé des teintes : pastille, nom,
  effectif, triée par nombre de contacts à l'écran. L'argument de la rampe de
  taille vit là où on le consulte — en tête de `aisLiveVessels.js` et dans
  `vesselLabels.js` — et ses compteurs restent dans les statistiques de la
  couche. Contrepartie assumée : le diamètre du chevron continue de porter la
  longueur hors-tout sans clé visible, ce qui est un écart à la règle D1 de
  `docs/CARTOGRAPHIE.md`.

### Fixed
- **« Active la couche DVF » : la couche s'allumait, l'écran restait vide, et
  l'outil répondait « c'est fait ».** Signalé comme « par la voix ça ne marche
  jamais, alors qu'en cliquant ça marche » — et le clic n'y était pour rien :
  les couches à balayage d'adresse (ventes DVF, avis de valeur, DPE, cadastre,
  urbanisme) scannent **300 m autour de la caméra** et se mettent en sommeil
  **au-dessus de 12 km**. Depuis une vue de ville, la couche passait bien à ON
  et ne dessinait rien ; `set_layer_visibility` renvoyait `ok: true` sans un mot,
  l'assistante disait « DVF activé », et l'opérateur voyait une carte vide. En
  cliquant soi-même on est déjà dans la rue, d'où l'illusion.

  **La vue se règle maintenant toute seule.** Allumer une couche, c'est demander
  à la voir : quand la hauteur de caméra est le seul obstacle, l'outil descend
  droit sur le point que l'opérateur avait déjà en cadre, relance le balayage et
  répond avec ce qui est à l'écran — pas avec une proposition. Mesuré :
  **23 027 m → 516 m**, et 12 ventes dessinées dans la foulée. Le cadrage suit
  la **portée** de la réponse et non le plafond : une couche déclare ce qu'elle
  couvre (`scanReachM`, 300 m pour DVF) et la caméra se pose à trois rayons,
  900 m — cadrer sur le plafond aurait donné 7 km, soit une couche réveillée et
  un pâté de maisons gros comme un point. Une couche sans portée déclarée garde
  60 % de son propre plafond : le bruit aérien s'endort à 250 km parce qu'il
  dessine un contour régional, et le descendre à 900 m répondrait à une question
  que personne n'a posée. Sans point au sol sous la caméra (le limbe, l'espace),
  rien ne bouge et l'explication de la couche tient.

  Les autres états sont dits aussi, parce qu'il n'y a pas qu'une façon d'être
  allumé sans rien montrer : `loading`, `source-error`, et `nothing-in-view`
  (ça marche, et cette vue-là est vide — une phrase sur la VUE, jamais sur le
  jeu de données). Le partage entre « en cours » et « en panne » passe par le
  `layerFeedState()` déjà partagé, donc une couche qui range son invite de zoom
  dans `stats.error` n'est pas annoncée en panne.
- **« Autour de la station des Grands Hommes, quel est le prix moyen d'un
  appartement ? » — « je n'ai pas accès à ces analyses ».** La réponse était
  honnête et le chiffre était déjà là : `/api/avis-valeur` avait rendu une
  médiane, son intervalle et les 68 ventes comparables qui la fondent, et la
  fiche à l'écran les imprimait. Il n'existait simplement aucun chemin de la
  couche vers le modèle — `analyst_query` ne connaissait pas `dvf-sales`, et
  aucun outil ne lisait ce qu'une couche a **calculé**. `get_entity_context`
  porte désormais `layerSummaries` : pour chaque couche allumée qui en publie
  un, le nombre que la couche a mesuré **avec sa méthode attachée** — le rayon,
  la médiane du pâté (5 435 €/m² place des Grands Hommes), combien de ventes
  portent un prix (97 sur 172), le médian de la commune qui sert de
  dénominateur (4 423 €/m²), et pour l'estimation le centre et son intervalle
  (5 576 €/m², 335 000 € pour 60 m², ±13 %). Le chiffre est **relevé**, jamais
  recalculé : une moyenne des points dessinés serait un second nombre pour la
  même question, avec une autre règle que celle de la fiche.
- **Les ventes DVF sont interrogeables.** `dvf-sales` publie ses mutations à
  `analyst_query` — combien de ventes autour, la plus chère au mètre carré,
  la plus proche. `prixM2` reste **null** partout où le registre ne peut pas
  chiffrer la vente (un immeuble de 179 lots, un appartement vendu avec un
  commerce) et le moteur écarte les valeurs non finies : les 32 M€ répartis sur
  179 lots comptent comme une vente et ne peuvent entrer dans aucun prix. Chaque
  ligne rendue porte une adresse, pas seulement un identifiant de mutation — la
  liste classée revenait en identifiants internes, que les règles de diction
  interdisent de prononcer.
- **Un résumé mesuré ailleurs ne peut plus être cité ici.** Les couches à
  balayage gardent le dernier pâté scanné jusqu'à ce que le suivant réponde :
  entre « emmène-moi à Bordeaux » et l'arrivée du scan, le résumé en main est
  celui de Paris. Chaque résumé dit maintenant **où** il a été mesuré, et
  au-delà de la portée de la couche il est remplacé par un `pending` qui dit de
  ne pas le citer. Même traitement pour la couche qu'on vient d'allumer : le
  silence se lisait comme « il n'y a rien ici », et une session réelle a
  répondu « les couches ne remontent aucune donnée » une demi-seconde avant
  qu'elles ne le fassent.
- **La voix se taisait au bout de trois phrases, et rien ne disait pourquoi.**
  Avec une clé OpenAI, une session Realtime renvoie *tout* son préambule à
  chaque réponse — les instructions plus les 29 schémas d'outils. Mesuré sur la
  configuration livrée : **10 886 jetons d'entrée** avant que l'opérateur ait
  parlé, contre un plafond de **40 000 jetons par minute** sur un compte d'entrée
  de gamme. Soit trois réponses par minute — et une seule commande qui appelle
  un outil en consomme deux (l'appel, puis la confirmation parlée). La quatrième
  phrase revenait donc en `status: "failed"`, l'assistante se taisait, et le
  dock n'affichait ni la cause ni l'attente : le micro avait l'air cassé alors
  qu'il était bridé. Le budget est maintenant lu dans `rate_limits.updated`,
  que la session envoie après chaque réponse : le dock prévient avant le mur
  (« TOKEN LIMIT REACHED — RESETS IN 33 S »), un tour englouti est **repris tout
  seul** après l'attente que l'API nomme elle-même — l'opérateur n'a pas à
  répéter sa question — et le message d'erreur explique le plafond au lieu de
  recracher l'identifiant d'organisation. Reparler ou couper le micro désarme
  la reprise. *(Le vrai levier reste le compte : le plafond se relève sur
  platform.openai.com/settings/organization/limits.)*
- **« Il y a 2000 bornes de recharge dans la vue » : 2000 était le plafond, pas
  un compte.** Chaque couche rend au plus 2 000 enregistrements à
  `analyst_query`, et sur Paris la couche IRVE atteint ce plafond — le nombre
  était donc dit comme un total. Mesuré au micro avec 2 200 bornes chargées :
  la réponse est désormais « **au moins** 2 000 … un plancher, pas un total
  exact ». Le plafond voyage dans `coverage.capped`, avec les mots à employer.
- **Un second moteur analytique interrogeait le monde du premier.** Le cache de
  `runAnalystQuery` gardait le `dataManager` avec lequel il était né : un
  deuxième `createGevActionRunner` — un viewer réinitialisé, ou deux harnais
  dans le même processus — questionnait donc les couches de l'ancien monde et
  recevait un zéro confiant. Le moteur suit maintenant son monde.
- **`qa:voice-routing` comptait comme des erreurs de routage des phrases que le
  modèle n'a jamais vues.** Le harnais envoyait six tours d'affilée : à
  ~11 000 jetons le tour, les suivants revenaient en `failed`, sans appel
  d'outil, et étaient notés FAIL. Il lit maintenant le même budget que l'app,
  attend la fenêtre suivante quand elle ne peut plus financer un tour, rejoue
  une fois un tour bridé, et marque SKIP — pas FAIL — ce qui reste bridé.
- **« Je n'ai pas cette couche » était faux : la voix ne pouvait nommer que 17
  couches sur 60.** L'énumération `layerId` des outils vocaux était écrite à la
  main et héritée de l'amont ; le fork avait grandi à 60 couches enregistrées.
  Un modèle qui respecte une énumération ne pouvait donc pas émettre
  `medecins-fr` — demander la couche médecins revenait à s'entendre dire
  qu'elle n'existait pas, et **43 couches**, toutes les françaises, étaient
  dans ce cas. Les quatre énumérations sont maintenant **dérivées du registre**
  (`src/voice/layerVocabulary.js` lit `LAYER_TAXONOMY`), un test échoue si les
  deux divergent, et la résolution accepte l'identifiant, les alias français et
  anglais et le libellé du panneau, accents et casse ignorés (« médecins »,
  « bornes de recharge », « vigilance météo », « îlots de fraîcheur »). Une
  couche inconnue ne fait plus échouer l'outil : elle renvoie **les trois plus
  proches**, et le nouvel outil `list_layers` permet de citer le registre au
  lieu de le deviner. Mesuré sur un vrai tour de modèle : « Active la couche
  médecin » atteint `medecins-fr`.
- **Un deuxième chemin envoyait « médecins » sur la mauvaise couche.**
  `LAYER_ALIASES` est un littéral `Map` : une clé en double gagne en silence, et
  `amenities-fr` réclamait « médecins », « docteurs » et « doctors » quatre
  cents lignes après `medecins-fr`. Le comptage d'équipements de la BPE
  répondait donc à une question sur le registre des praticiens. Les mots sont
  revenus à la couche qui tient le registre, et un test refuse désormais toute
  clé en double.
- **La voix ne savait pas lire une station qu'elle venait d'afficher.**
  Interrogée sur les vélos et les places d'une station TBM sélectionnée, elle
  renvoyait au site de l'opérateur — alors que le nombre de vélos, de places et
  la capacité étaient déjà dans le navigateur. `get_entity_context` ne lisait la
  sélection que sur quatre familles suivables ; il lit maintenant **toutes** les
  couches qui savent répondre, et ajoute les enregistrements chargés les plus
  proches avec leur distance. `bikeshare`, `irve-fr`, `medecins-fr`,
  `shared-mobility-fr` et `transit-fr` exposent leur sélection et leurs
  enregistrements ; `analyst_query` passe de 5 à **22 couches**, donc « combien
  de bornes dans la vue » et « la station la plus proche avec des vélos »
  répondent sur les données chargées. Un compte issu d'une couche chargée par
  viewport le dit, au lieu de se faire passer pour un total national.
- **Un filtre nommant un champ que la couche ne publie pas répondait « zéro ».**
  Le pire mode de panne du moteur analytique : zéro est une réponse plausible et
  rien n'a l'air cassé. Mesuré au banc — interrogé sur les bornes libres, le
  modèle filtrait `irve-fr` sur `bikesAvailable`, un champ d'une autre couche.
  Le moteur refuse maintenant et **nomme les champs réels**, ce qui laisse au
  modèle une chance de se corriger dans le même tour.
- **Le cerveau texte ne savait ni où il était ni ce que « cette station »
  désignait.** Le chemin OpenRouter postait les seuls messages : ni caméra, ni
  lieu, ni couches actives, ni sélection. Un préambule de situation court
  précède maintenant chaque tour, et un seul est conservé dans l'historique —
  une conversation de dix tours ne traîne pas dix instantanés qui se
  contredisent. Mesuré : « Où suis-je ? » et « Je regarde quoi, là ? »
  répondent **sans appel d'outil**.
- **La voix de retour, sur Safari, était la synthèse concaténative d'il y a
  vingt ans.** Toutes les voix `fr-FR` d'Apple étaient à égalité dans le choix,
  donc la première listée gagnait — la voix compacte. Le choix suit maintenant
  une préférence explicite par navigateur (Audrey/Amélie sur Safari, les voix
  neuronales « Natural » sur Edge, « Google français » sur Chrome), un
  sélecteur dans le dock mémorise la voix retenue, et si seule la voix compacte
  est installée le dock **dit où télécharger la bonne**. Chrome renvoie une
  liste vide au premier appel : elle est maintenant attendue. *(Ce chemin ne
  concerne que le micro sans clé OpenAI ; une session Realtime parle avec la
  voix du modèle.)*
- **Les oreilles se rouvraient au milieu de la phrase.** `speak()` arrêtait la
  reconnaissance, ce qui déclenchait un redémarrage programmé 250 ms plus tard
  — en plein milieu de la confirmation prononcée. Le micro écoutait donc les
  haut-parleurs jusqu'à la fin de la phrase. Elles restent fermées, et
  **Espace coupe la synthèse** et rend la parole.

- **Un 429 devant l'app laissait le micro mort, et accusait la permission
  micro.** Sur l'instance hébergée, une règle de limitation à la périphérie
  (mesurée : 30 requêtes `/api` par 10 s et par adresse, puis 10 s de blocage)
  se déclenchait sur du trafic parallèle depuis la même adresse — un script,
  un harnais, des onglets qui rechargent ; la page elle-même n'émet que six
  requêtes `/api` au démarrage — et pendant ces dix secondes le micro lisait
  « HTTP 429, cliquez à nouveau » sous un conseil sur la permission du micro.
  Le serveur disait combien de temps attendre ; personne ne le lisait. La
  lecture de configuration honore désormais `Retry-After` : le dock affiche
  l'attente (« RATE LIMITED — RETRY IN 10 S »), réessaie, deux fois au plus,
  puis montre un diagnostic qui commence par « Not the microphone ». Un tour
  de parole qui reçoit un 429 attend et redemande une fois. Et derrière un
  tunnel, `GEV_TRUSTED_CLIENT_IP_HEADER` fait enfin voir aux limiteurs
  « par IP » l'adresse du visiteur plutôt que celle du proxy — `/healthz`
  renvoie `client` pour le vérifier. Ce qu'une règle de périphérie doit
  couvrir, et ne pas couvrir, est écrit dans `docs/DEPLOY.md`.

### Removed
- **Les emprises d'aérodromes ne sont plus une ligne à côté des Aéroports :
  elles sont dedans.** La liste des couches portait les deux — ✈ *Aéroports*
  et ▱ *Emprises d'aérodromes (BD TOPO)*, voisines dans le même groupe — depuis
  que la seconde avait servi d'exemple à la boîte à datasets. Depuis que la
  couche Aéroports embarque **418 de ces emprises**, jointes à OurAirports sur
  le code OACI, les deux lignes disaient la même chose au même endroit et
  demandaient au lecteur d'arbitrer un recouvrement qu'il n'a aucun moyen de
  voir : les deux portaient jusqu'à la même teinte (`#b388ff`), donc allumer
  les deux redessinait le tablier de Roissy par-dessus lui-même sans qu'aucune
  des deux lignes ne l'annonce. Le manifeste
  `datasets/aerodromes-bdtopo-ign.json` est retiré ; **rien ne disparaît de la
  carte** — l'emprise se dessine en allumant *Aéroports*, avec sa pastille
  ▱ **Emprise au sol** dans la légende et l'attribution IGN sur la fiche.
  Ce que la jointure laisse dehors reste dit — les 704 héliports de la BD TOPO
  et les 30 contours surtout militaires qu'aucun terrain ne réclame — et reste
  branchable en une adresse (`BDTOPO_V3:aerodrome` sur
  `https://data.geopf.fr/wfs/ows`, collée dans ＋ BRANCHER UN JEU DE DONNÉES) ;
  ce n'est simplement plus livré comme une couche que personne n'a demandée.

## [Unreleased] — 2026-09-08

### Added
- **La boîte à datasets — n'importe quel jeu de données se branche, sans
  code.** Sous la liste des couches, **＋ BRANCHER UN JEU DE DONNÉES** prend
  l'adresse d'une page data.gouv.fr, d'un portail Opendatasoft, d'un WFS ou
  d'un GeoJSON/CSV nu, lit ce que la plateforme publie sur elle-même (titre,
  éditeur, licence, colonnes, un échantillon), devine la géométrie **et dit
  pourquoi**, puis dessine le jeu à sa place — groupé, crédité, avec une carte
  et une légende. Le même manifeste, déposé dans `datasets/<id>.json`, livre
  la couche à tout le monde au build ; `npm run dataset:manifest -- <url>`
  l'écrit depuis un terminal, un pas après une recherche sur le MCP officiel
  de data.gouv.fr. **Six adaptateurs**, dont l'API tabulaire de data.gouv.fr
  par pages de 200 lignes filtrées sur l'emprise — 161 Mo de fichier IRVE
  deviennent 11 633 lignes pour la vue de Paris. Tout part du navigateur ;
  un relais sur liste blanche (`/api/plug`) couvre les hôtes qui refusent un
  `Origin`. Ce qu'un jeu branché ne reçoit pas — jeton de partage,
  énumération vocale, choroplèthe — est écrit dans `docs/DATASETS.md`, avec
  la raison. Trois manifestes livrés : défibrillateurs GeoDAE, arbres
  remarquables de Paris, emprises d'aérodromes BD TOPO.
- **La voix marche sans compte OpenAI — oreilles et bouche du navigateur,
  Mistral Medium 3.1 au milieu.** Le micro exigeait une clé OpenAI ; sans elle,
  le bouton était mort. Il accepte désormais **une clé au choix**. Sur le
  chemin OpenRouter, la reconnaissance et la synthèse vocales sont celles du
  navigateur (sans clé, sans téléchargement) et seul le cerveau est facturé :
  **0,001 à 0,005 $ par commande parlée**, mesuré. Le cerveau par défaut a été
  choisi sur un banc de routage français construit sur les 28 schémas d'outils
  de l'app — 26/26 sur le choix d'outil, et le seul modèle du banc à avoir
  refusé d'inventer une histoire à partir d'un dossier mince. `tools`,
  `instructions` et le runner d'actions sont partagés entre les deux chemins :
  une seule source, deux transports. Le serveur garde la clé, le prompt système
  et la liste d'outils, donc une instance publique ne devient pas un endpoint
  LLM gratuit pour quelqu'un d'autre. Contrepartie annoncée : c'est du tour par
  tour, pas du duplex — on ne coupe pas la parole au modèle.
  `GEV_VOICE_PROVIDER`, `GEV_VOICE_LANGUAGE`, `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`,
  `OPENROUTER_VOICE_MODEL` — voir `.env.example`. Nouveau harnais :
  `npm run qa:voice-brain`.
- **Le micro parle français.** `GEV_VOICE_LANGUAGE=fr-FR` pilote la
  reconnaissance vocale, le choix de la voix de synthèse, et une instruction qui
  dit au modèle quelle langue **parler**. Le contrat d'outils reste en anglais
  des deux côtés : les noms d'outils, les arguments et les valeurs d'énumération
  ne sont jamais traduits, pas plus qu'un indicatif d'appel ou un code OACI.
- **Comparables (sélection conseiller) 🇫🇷 — le module qui manquait face à
  Cityscan, construit comme eux le construisent, et sans rien acheter.** Le
  démontage du concurrent (`docs/CITYSCAN.md`) avait laissé une seule case
  vraiment vide : les annonces. Le fichier de traductions public de Cityscan
  nomme lui-même sa source — « *Source : Sélection de votre conseiller(ère)
  parmi les portails d'annonces* » — donc leur module de comparables ne contient
  aucune base d'annonces : il contient un écran où le conseiller choisit. C'est
  cet écran. **Un dossier par bien** : on pose le bien (centre de la vue ou
  adresse géocodée), on retient les ventes DVF que le panneau propose dans un
  rayon de 500 m, on saisit les annonces qu'on a sous les yeux, et on lit ce
  dont un avis de valeur est réellement fait.
  **Un prix demandé et un prix payé ne sont jamais moyennés ensemble.** C'est
  l'axiome A1 appliqué à une fiche plutôt qu'à une choroplèthe : une intention
  et une observation ne sont pas la même mesure. Deux médianes calculées à part,
  deux silhouettes sur le globe — le signe € de DVF pour une mutation, une
  **étiquette de prix** ajoutée au jeu d'icônes pour une annonce — et l'écart
  entre les deux imprimé sur sa propre ligne, avec les deux tailles
  d'échantillon à côté et la phrase qui refuse la lecture facile : ce ne sont ni
  les mêmes biens ni les mêmes dates, aucun ajustement temporel n'est appliqué,
  donc ce n'est **pas** une marge de négociation. La fourchette est un
  **intervalle interquartile sur un échantillon nommé**, refusée sous trois
  comparables, et jamais vendue comme un intervalle de confiance.
  **Tout ce qui est écarté est compté et dit** (A5) : pas de €/m² sans surface,
  pas de €/m² recalculé pour une mutation multi-lots — le registre y publie
  `null` et diviser quand même donne les 1,28 M€/m² que `dvfFeed.js` avait déjà
  mesurés sur un immeuble de 179 lots — et pas de €/m² hors de **300–50 000 €**,
  bornes assez larges pour la Creuse comme pour le 6e et assez serrées pour
  attraper un zéro de trop. L'âge porte l'alpha du marqueur (A2) ; une date
  **inconnue** ne prend pas discrètement l'alpha du plus vieux, elle prend un
  **trait pointillé** vers le bien.
  **Rien n'est acheté et rien n'est aspiré.** Le fork part en open source, donc
  un flux payant (Yanport à 200 €/mois, PriceHubble, Casafari) serait un mur
  pour quiconque clone le dépôt, pas une dépendance. Et l'extraction des
  portails est jugée, chiffrée et récente : Cass. 1re civ. **5 oct. 2022**
  n° 21-16.307, Cass. 1re civ. **15 oct. 2025** n° 23-23.167, CA Versailles
  **14 avr. 2026** n° 24/05370 — **200 000 €** et **500 € par annonce** sous
  astreinte. Le lien d'une annonce est donc stocké **comme lien** et jamais
  requêté : `scripts/qa-comparables.mjs` surveille toutes les requêtes de la
  page et échoue si une seule atteint l'hôte saisi dans ce champ.
  **Le dossier ne quitte pas le navigateur — dit précisément.** Pas de compte,
  pas de backend, pas d'envoi : `localStorage`, export et import par fichier —
  l'import accepte aussi un simple tableau JSON d'annonces, qui est la forme
  qu'exporte le logiciel métier d'une agence, et il **fusionne** au lieu de
  remplacer. Prix, surfaces et liens ne sont jamais transmis. Ce qui sort, et
  qui est écrit dans le panneau plutôt que dans un commentaire : **l'adresse que
  vous tapez**, envoyée au géocodeur (BAN / IGN) pour devenir des coordonnées,
  et **la position du bien**, envoyée à DVF. « Rien ne quitte le navigateur »
  était la version ronde ; une passe adverse a eu raison de la refuser. Le lien
  de partage ne transporte que l'état on/off de la couche, ce qui est exactement
  ce qu'on veut du bien d'un client. Jeton de partage `cp`, panneau auto-monté
  par la couche (le patron du Pouls vélo), 34 contrôles navigateur au vert
  contre le DVF réel à Lyon.

- **La pastille « IGN Ortho » s'appelle « Satellite ».** Elle avait cessé d'être
  ce que son nom disait : depuis qu'un fond satellite mondial passe dessous, elle
  ne décrit plus un îlot français mais la seule source d'imagerie du globe. C'est
  la seule pastille du bandeau nommée par son CONTENU et non par son fournisseur,
  parce que c'est la seule qui en sert plusieurs — IGN au-dessus de la France,
  Esri au-delà. L'infobulle porte le détail : « Satellite — IGN 20 cm over
  France, world satellite beyond ».
  **L'identifiant `ign-ortho` ne bouge pas.** C'est le jeton de partage de
  `?map=`, et le renommer aurait cassé tous les liens jamais copiés depuis
  l'application. Seul change ce que l'opérateur lit.

- **Ce qui est gratuit ici et bloqué dans un produit payant, écrit noir sur blanc.**
  `DATA_SOURCES.md` gagne une section **Commercial use** : un tableau ✅/❌ source
  par source, et le chemin de remplacement chiffré pour celles qui tombent. Le
  dépôt disait de la licence Esri qu'elle était « a grey area for a MIT fork » —
  c'est faux, et la formulation est corrigée : la documentation d'Esri pour ces
  *legacy tile services* dit mot pour mot *« this service is not available for
  commercial use »*, et l'item déclare l'**Esri Master License Agreement**.
  Rien ne change pour ce projet, qui est gratuit et reste dans les clous ; la
  section existe pour que la décision se prenne sur les faits le jour où
  quelqu'un facturera.
  **Deux pièges que le tableau nomme et que personne ne verrait venir :** le
  palier gratuit de Cesium ion est explicitement « Personal and non-commercial
  use », donc les deux pastilles Bing sont inutilisables dans un produit payant.
  Et le millésime **2017** de
  Sentinel-2 cloudless n'est pas un détail : le « mettre à jour » vers 2018-2025
  ferait basculer cette ligne en ❌, tous ces millésimes étant CC BY-**NC**-SA.
  L'attribution Esri est alignée sur son `copyrightText` officiel, où Maxar est
  devenu **Vantor**.

- **Les deux instruments qui ont décidé le fond satellite, versés dans le dépôt.**
  Ils vivaient dans un répertoire de travail non versionné, alors que ce sont eux
  qui portent la preuve. `npm run qa:world-imagery` cadre quatre vues qui mettent
  une frontière dans l'image — Douvres, le Rhin, les Pyrénées, plus Manhattan en
  témoin — vérifie la composition, les attributions des deux licences, et
  **contrôle désormais que la caméra est bien où le cadrage l'a demandée** : le
  vol de démarrage écrasait silencieusement la première vue, si bien que la
  capture montrait Paris pendant que tous les contrôles passaient au vert.
  `npm run qa:world-imagery-cost` imprime le coût par stratégie, en tuiles et en
  octets.
  **Et le banc corrige un chiffre que le dépôt affirmait.** Rendu déterministe —
  il neutralise explicitement la mise en veille du produit, sinon toutes ses
  lignes finissent par mesurer la même chose — il montre que `cutoutRectangle`
  lit **exactement 813 ko, tuile pour tuile, comme l'empilement nu**. La première
  mesure disait 813 contre 874 et laissait croire à une petite économie : c'était
  du bruit. Le constat n'en est que plus net, et les commentaires du code, la
  fiche d'état et le changelog qui citaient 874 ko sont corrigés.

- **Le globe a enfin des photos hors de France, et il en charge moins qu'avant.**
  `IGN Ortho` compositait son orthophoto 20 cm sur un fond mondial de **traits
  OSM** : un plan de rues sous une photographie, ce qui se lit comme un défaut
  de rendu dès que la caméra passe la frontière. Le fond devient de l'imagerie
  satellite mondiale, **sans clé ni compte** — Esri World Imagery, plafonné au
  z19 qui est exactement celui de l'IGN, donc le fond prolonge la couche nette
  sans jamais la dépasser. L'IGN reste prioritaire partout où elle a des tuiles.
  Le satellite Google, lui, reste hors d'atteinte : il est retiré à toute
  facturation européenne, ce qu'une sonde du 2026-09-08 reconfirme (`satellite`
  403, `roadmap` 200 sur la même clé).
  **Et le fond se met en veille au lieu de se charger pour rien.** Cesium
  télécharge intégralement une couche basse même quand la couche du dessus la
  masque à 100 % : au-dessus de Paris, le fond invisible coûtait **46 tuiles /
  874 ko par vue, plus que l'orthophoto visible elle-même**. Sur les cinq boîtes
  où l'IGN est prouvée opaque, la couche mondiale passe à `show = false` et le
  coût tombe à **zéro tuile**. `cutoutRectangle` avait été mesuré d'abord et
  écarté : il coupe le dessin, pas le téléchargement (813 ko contre 874). Le
  même mécanisme s'applique à `Plan IGN`, dont la base OSM gaspillait déjà
  37 tuiles / 268 ko par vue parisienne avant ce changement — le stack est donc
  **plus léger qu'avant** tout en couvrant le monde.
  **Les boîtes de veille sont sondées, pas devinées.** Le rectangle d'une couche
  n'est pas sa couverture : le clamp France englobe Bruxelles, où la
  Géoplateforme répond `No data found`. Éteindre le fond sur ce rectangle
  percerait des trous blancs. Les cinq boîtes retenues sont les plus grandes
  boîtes intérieures ayant passé un sondage tuile à tuile au z13 sans un seul
  manque (81/81 puis 49/49). Les villes côtières et frontalières en sont
  volontairement absentes : là, le fond est réellement visible.
  **Un repli de licence, pas seulement de panne.** Si Esri échoue six tuiles
  distinctes, le fond bascule en place sur Sentinel-2 cloudless **2017** (EOX,
  CC BY 4.0) sans toucher à la couche IGN ni à son cache. Le millésime est
  délibéré : chez EOX, seuls 2016 et 2017 sont en CC BY — 2018 à 2025 sont en
  CC BY-**NC**-SA, inembarquables dans un dépôt MIT.

- **La radiographie d'adresse — dix thématiques sur une feuille.**
  `/fiche.html?lat=&lon=` interroge quinze routes de l'application en parallèle
  et compose les dix thématiques de la grille Cityscan — Immobilier, Transport,
  Éducation, Commodités, Nuisances, Risques, Numérique, Emploi, Urbanisme,
  Voisinage — en valeurs mesurées. `?embed=1` retire l'habillage pour une
  iframe et l'impression du navigateur produit le PDF : les deux offres à 50 €
  et 30 €/mois relevées au démontage, sans une ligne de backend. Palier 1 du
  triage `docs/CITYSCAN.md`.
  **Deux chiffres sont situés dans le pays, huit ne le sont pas et disent
  pourquoi.** La surface atteignable à pied en dix minutes et le prix médian au
  m² sont mesurés sur exactement les formes du barème national — un centile,
  plus une lettre pour la première. Les chiffres de voisinage de la feuille sont
  moyennés sur un **rectangle de carreaux**, pas sur un anneau piéton :
  `scoreIndicator()` les refuse sur la géométrie, et la feuille imprime le
  refus au lieu d'un tiret.
  **Une page, pas un panneau, et elle ne charge pas Cesium.** La carte du globe
  est plafonnée à six lignes ; dix thématiques en font soixante. La feuille
  pèse **23 ko de JS** — un greffon retire les injections de `vite-plugin-cesium`
  des pages qui sont des documents, en dev comme au build.
  **Le faux négatif qu'elle refuse :** Géorisques éclate en trois appels et
  répond HTTP 200 même quand le rapport de risques a lâché. « non lus » n'est
  pas « aucun risque », et le payload dégradé est capturé en fixture.
- **Quatre sources qui ferment les trous de la grille.** Quatre routes
  d'adresse, chacune avec son module pur et ses fixtures capturées en direct :
  **carte des loyers 2025** (`/api/loyers-fr`) — 30 029 communes sur 34 900
  reçoivent un loyer calculé pour une *maille* de voisines, l'intervalle publié
  fait 45,7 % de la valeur, et c'est charges comprises ;
  **Ma connexion internet** (`/api/arcep-fr`) — le fichier par défaut répond
  « 100 % éligibles à 30 Mbit/s » parce qu'il compte le satellite, la variante
  filaire répond 95,4 %, et c'est elle qui est lue ;
  **indice ATMO** (`/api/atmo-fr`) — l'indice du jour et les deux suivants, avec
  les cinq sous-indices dont il est le maximum ;
  **recensement INSEE** (`/api/emploi-fr`) — activité, emploi et chômage sur
  trois recensements, avec le taux retenu sous 100 actifs.
- **La base permanente des équipements passe de dix codes à vingt-quatre.**
  Sept familles de plus — restaurants, boulangeries, commerces de bouche,
  banques, salles de sport, lieux culturels, stations-service — soit vingt et un
  types de plus de la taxonomie POI de Cityscan. **126 857 → 521 672 lignes
  dessinées**, 95 404 → 445 380 points, et le pack national passe de 37,8 Mo à
  170 Mo. Quatre de leurs trente types restent hors d'atteinte parce que le
  registre ne les porte pas : ni bar, ni café, ni musée, ni tabac, ni jardin
  public dans l'édition 2025.

### Fixed
- **Une clé Google présente mais morte rendait toute la planète injoignable.**
  `searchAndFlyTo` interrogeait Google directement ; sur un `REQUEST_DENIED`
  (facturation désactivée, API non activée, restriction régionale) il renvoyait
  `null` et s'arrêtait là — alors que le géocodeur keyless répondait
  correctement au même instant. Tout lieu hors des presets devenait
  silencieusement introuvable, à la voix comme à la barre de recherche. Une clé
  cassée dégrade maintenant **vers** le chemin keyless, pas au-delà.
- **« Emmène-moi à Bordeaux » pouvait atterrir à Paris.** Plusieurs modèles
  répondent à `fly_to_location` avec un preset **et** une requête libre
  contradictoires (`{locationId:"paris", query:"Bordeaux"}`). Le preset gagnait.
  C'est désormais le lieu que l'utilisateur a réellement prononcé qui gagne — la
  seule panne qu'un utilisateur à la voix n'a aucun moyen de diagnostiquer.
- **Les sept villes françaises étaient invisibles pour le modèle.** Marseille,
  Lyon, Toulouse, Nice, Nantes, Montpellier et Strasbourg avaient leur cadrage
  réglé à la main dans `CITY_POIS` mais ne figuraient pas dans l'énumération de
  `fly_to_location`. Le modèle ne pouvait pas les nommer et retombait sur un
  géocodage générique. Un test échoue désormais si les deux listes divergent.
- **Le dépôt annonçait la mort de Bing pour ce mois-ci. C'est faux, et la
  formulation vient de nous.** `DATA_SOURCES.md` lisait « at least through
  September 2026 » comme une échéance alors que c'est un **plancher de
  garantie** — la phrase est toujours publiée telle quelle par Cesium, jamais
  mise à jour. La vraie borne vient de l'annonce de Cesium : ils sont client
  **Bing Maps Enterprise**, « the latest possible end date for our use is
  **June 30, 2028** », et « if you are using Bing Maps through Cesium ion, you
  can continue to do so without worry » — avec annonce préalable et fenêtre de
  test avant tout retrait. Un lecteur qui croyait cette ligne aurait supprimé
  deux sources encore vivantes ; le fichier explique donc l'erreur au lieu de
  l'effacer.
  **Et le successeur est nommé** : Cesium a versé les assets **Google Maps 2D**
  dans ion le 2 octobre 2025 (Satellite, Satellite + labels, Roadmap…),
  diffusés sous *leur* accord Google et non sous une clé à soi, dans l'ancien
  quota Bing rebaptisé « Global Imagery ».

- **Le satellite Google marche depuis la France par Cesium ion — mesuré, pas
  déduit.** C'était la question ouverte depuis un mois. Sondé le 2026-09-08
  depuis cette machine avec un token ion **gratuit** : tuile de Paris en z18,
  **HTTP 200, `image/jpeg`, 26 443 octets**, plus Lyon et un témoin new-yorkais.
  L'explication est dans la notice EEE de Google elle-même : le blocage vise les
  « projects linked to an account with an **EEA billing address** », jamais la
  position de l'utilisateur final — et sur ce chemin le projet Google est celui
  de Cesium, aux États-Unis. ion crée la session Google lui-même et sert les
  tuiles par un proxy signé ; le navigateur ne parle jamais à
  `tile.googleapis.com`. Trois mesures qui décideront du câblage : les tuiles
  répondent jusqu'au **z22** (l'IGN s'arrête au z19), le proxy renvoie
  `access-control-allow-origin: *`, et la session **expire au bout d'une heure**.
  Rien n'est câblé : la section documente ce qui est prouvé et ce qui coûterait
  du travail.
  **Deux identifiants d'asset annoncés se sont révélés inatteignables** — Azure
  Maps et Sentinel-2 répondent `404 ResourceNotFound` sur un compte Community,
  là où Bing et Google 2D passent sans réglage. Le tableau porte donc le
  résultat du sondage asset par asset, et non la liste de la Sandcastle prise
  pour argent comptant.

- **La couche Équipements disait 12 000 points là où elle en connaissait
  53 121.** Le plafond de la route `/sites` ne mordait jamais — le carré le plus
  dense que le zoom autorise tenait 9 139 points. Après l'élargissement il en
  tient 53 121, et 41 121 étaient écartés en silence. Le nombre était publié
  dans le payload depuis toujours ; la couche l'affiche maintenant sous son
  interrupteur, avec le renvoi au maillage.

- **Le barème national — la fiche d'adresse dit enfin où elle se situe dans le
  pays.** « 0,96 km² atteignables à pied » est un fait qu'aucun lecteur ne peut
  lire sans un pays contre lequel le lire. La `Fiche implantation` imprime
  désormais, sous ses valeurs, un **centile national** par indicateur et une
  **lettre A→E** pour les trois dont le sens n'est pas une opinion. Méthode,
  mesures et refus : `docs/BAREME.md`. Palier 1½ du triage
  `docs/CITYSCAN.md`.
  **Le chiffrage annoncé se trompait de lot.** Le triage prévoyait « précalculer
  120 indicateurs sur 35 000 communes, les stocker et les rafraîchir » : un
  tableau à la commune **ne peut pas noter la fiche**, parce que la fiche ne
  mesure rien à la commune — elle mesure sur un anneau piéton de dix minutes.
  Le bon lot est un **tirage**, pas un inventaire. `npm run bareme:fr` balaie
  une fois la trame nationale — **377 234 carreaux de 1 km, 64 089 848
  habitants** — puis tire des RÉSIDENTS à probabilité proportionnelle à la
  population, en deux degrés et systématiquement, et fait tourner sur chaque
  porte la composition que la fiche fait sur l'adresse du lecteur.
  **Première campagne : 1 200 anneaux, zéro refus, 42 minutes.** Le résultat
  tient dans **~2 Ko gelés** dans `src/data/baremeNational.js` ; un chargement de
  page ne coûte **pas un octet de plus**. Le volume que le triage redoutait
  n'existe pas : un barème est une distribution, et une distribution bien tirée
  de mille observations donne un centile à ±2,9 points.
  **Le chiffre qui justifie le lot : l'échelle d'anneau vaut 74 % de l'échelle
  de carreau.** Le dépôt portait déjà `FILOSOFI_RAMPS`, les mêmes indicateurs au
  carreau de 200 m, gratuits à un `import` près. Mesurés **deux fois sur le même
  échantillon**, l'anneau et le carreau ne donnent pas la même distribution :
  moyenner une trentaine de carreaux rentre les deux queues. Noté sur l'échelle
  de carreau, un anneau au **10ᵉ centile se lirait au 22ᵉ** et un anneau au
  **90ᵉ au 84ᵉ** — une bande de lettre entière à chaque extrémité, et rien à
  l'écran ne l'aurait dit. D'où la règle que le module rend impossible à
  oublier : **une valeur ne se classe que dans une distribution mesurée sur la
  même géométrie**, et `geometry` est comparé à chaque appel. Sur un anneau de
  cinq ou quinze minutes, les rangs d'anneau sont refusés **et la carte le dit**,
  pendant que le rang du prix — mesuré sur un disque de 300 m que le pas de temps
  ne touche pas — survit.
  **Huit indicateurs sur onze n'ont pas de lettre, et c'est une décision.** Une
  lettre exige de savoir dans quel sens l'indicateur est « bon » ; pour la part
  de logement social, l'âge des habitants ou le prix au m², le sens dépend
  entièrement de qui demande — un prix élevé est une bonne nouvelle pour un
  vendeur et une mauvaise pour un acheteur. Ceux-là reçoivent un **rang, jamais
  de note**. Les trois qui portent une lettre l'annoncent avec leur convention
  sur la même ligne : *lettres au sens du résident acheteur, A = le meilleur
  cinquième de France*. Chaque `direction` porte sa justification écrite, et un
  test la refuse si elle manque.
  **La lettre est elle-même une fourchette.** ±2,9 points de centile sur 1 200
  tirages : une valeur assise près d'une borne de quintile s'imprime « C ou D »
  — vu à la place de la République — plutôt que la meilleure des deux. Et une
  valeur assise sur un palier de l'échelle (0 % de logement social couvre le bas
  de la distribution) reçoit un intervalle de centiles, jamais un point : y
  interpoler inventerait une précision que la donnée refuse.
  **Le rang du prix ne couvre pas le pays, et le dit.** 151 anneaux sur 1 200
  n'avaient aucune vente comparable dans leurs 300 m, et ils sont ruraux : la
  carte imprime « le rang du prix se lit sur les 87 % d'anneaux où une vente
  comparable existait — une France plus urbaine que la France ».

- **L'avis de valeur — le seul composant fermé de Cityscan, ouvert et borné.**
  `docs/CITYSCAN.md` a démonté le produit et n'a trouvé, derrière ses onze
  routes de données, **aucune source que nous n'ayons pas déjà** : leur propre
  fichier de traduction public ne crédite « Source : Algorithme » que pour un
  seul module, l'estimation. Une couche **Avis de valeur (DVF)** (`vv`,
  `/api/avis-valeur`) répond à « que vaut ce logement-ci » à partir des mêmes
  millésimes DVF que la carte des ventes, et **ne publie jamais un prix sans
  l'intervalle dans lequel il se tient**.
  **Deux incertitudes, jamais confondues.** La *fourchette* p25–p75 dit où les
  ventes comparables ont changé de main au m² — elle ne rétrécit pas quand les
  données s'accumulent, parce que ce n'est pas une barre d'erreur mais la
  dispersion du marché, et elle ne borne pas ce logement-ci. L'*intervalle sur
  la médiane* dit à quel point le milieu est fermement placé : l'intervalle
  classique `[x(k), x(n+1−k)]`, dont la couverture est calculée depuis la
  binomiale et **vérifiée par rééchantillonnage** — nominal 93,8 / 93,0 /
  96,1 / 90,1 % à n = 5 / 8 / 12 / 30, empirique 93,6 / 93,0 / 96,9 / 90,8 %
  sur les 4 192 ventes d'appartements de Paris 13e, éditions 2023–2025. Les
  deux bornes sont affichées séparément, parce qu'un `±` sur un intervalle
  d'ordres statistiques sous-déclare un côté : à Paris le milieu est connu à
  **−5,3 % / +3,2 %**, pas à « ±4,3 % ».
  **Le plancher de cinq ventes est dérivé, pas choisi** : à quatre, l'échantillon
  entier ne couvre la médiane qu'à 87,5 % et aucun intervalle à 90 % n'existe.
  **Trois réponses, trois phrases** : une valeur avec sa fourchette ; une
  fourchette *sans* valeur, quand on ne connaît pas le milieu mieux que le
  marché n'est dispersé ou qu'une borne s'écarte de plus de 20 % ; ou rien du
  tout, en disant lequel des silences c'est. **Et le registre a un trou que
  personne n'annonce** : DVF ne couvre ni le Bas-Rhin, ni le Haut-Rhin, ni la
  Moselle, ni Mayotte — mesuré, les quatre répondent 404 quand La Réunion répond
  200 — soit trois millions d'habitants pour qui « le fichier n'existe pas ici »
  n'est pas « aucune vente ici ».
  **L'échelle d'élargissement dépense la distance avant la surface**, et c'est
  mesuré : élargir la bande de surface de ±20 % à ±35 % déplace le prix au m²
  entre le bas et le haut de la bande de 3,0 → 3,6 % à Paris, 4,0 → 10,7 % à
  Lille et **13,3 → 20,4 % à Ajaccio**, un biais invisible ; élargir le rayon
  coûte la prémisse « ici », mais le rayon est écrit, dessiné et cliquable.
  Choisir l'échelon sur les prix qui fixent ensuite l'intervalle est une
  sélection, et elle est **mesurée plutôt que passée sous silence** : 91,9 à
  92,8 % de couverture après sélection sur les lois de prix de quatre communes
  réelles, mais **0 % sur une loi à deux modes** — la forme qui casse la
  méthode, et elle est nommée.
  **La dérive du marché est mesurée et affichée, jamais appliquée** : la
  corriger par un indice communal annuel injecterait ±7 à ±11 % de bruit pour
  rattraper 2 à 5 % de biais résiduel.
  **Quatre exclusions comptées** : les VEFA (mesurées à +43 % sur Paris 13e),
  les logements déclarés à un euro — dont un 166 m² place Pinel, et dont
  l'arrondi au m² donne 0, un nombre qui franchit tous les garde-fous —, les
  ventes chiffrées sans coordonnée, et une même mutation livrée deux fois.
- **Le chiffrage du GTFS-RT national — la question laissée ouverte par la
  chronique, répondue en octets.** `docs/CHRONIQUE.md` disait qu'enregistrer
  les 150 flux GTFS-RT français nationalement « demande un chiffrage avant de
  l'allumer ». Il est fait, mesuré à **deux heures** — une soirée à 1 259
  véhicules et un matin à 4 799 — contre les 147 ressources distinctes de
  l'index et contre les horaires publiés de quatre réseaux, et il tient dans
  `docs/CHRONIQUE-GTFS-RT.md`.
  **La journée de service est l'unité de compte, pas l'heure du sondage** : à
  22 h la France en service pèse un cinquième de ce qu'elle pèse à 17 h, donc
  multiplier un balayage nocturne par 1 440 se tromperait de 80 %. La forme de
  la journée vient des horaires — **10,62 véhicule-heures et 428,3 passages
  d'arrêt par véhicule en service à 17 h**, pondérés sur quatre réseaux — et
  l'ancre est le sondage national de 17 h 18 : **7 212 véhicules**, d'où
  **76 591 véhicule-heures et 3,09 millions de passages d'arrêt par jour**.
  **Un balayage national pèse 157 Ko compressés plus 59 o par véhicule** — la
  droite qui passe par les deux mesures. Quatre fois plus de véhicules le matin
  n'ont pas doublé les octets, parce que la moitié d'un corps de positions est
  faite de mises à jour de course qui ne suivent pas la flotte : extrapoler
  depuis la seule heure creuse surestimait la facture réseau de **40 %**, et
  c'est le balayage de contrôle qui l'a montré.
  **Le prix varie d'un facteur 40 selon la forme qu'on garde.** Sur un an, à
  30 s, garder les corps entiers coûte **342 Go**, garder la position projetée
  **76 Go**, et la garder dédupliquée **42,3 Go** — une position en NDJSON pèse
  24,6 o compressée contre 36,7 o en protobuf, donc garder ce qu'on tire du
  corps coûte moins cher que garder le corps. Les **passages d'arrêt** —
  l'objet qui vaut le produit — pèsent **10 à 11,3 Go par an** et ne dépendent
  pas de la cadence : un bus ne passe qu'une fois. Les semaines types, elles,
  sont gratuites : 70 Mo pour les 6 895 lignes françaises, pour toujours.
  **Un véhicule français émet une position toutes les ~39 s** : sonder à 30 s en
  récolte 72 %, à 60 s 42 %, et à 10 s on paye trois fois le prix pour 40 % de
  plus (écart médian de republication mesuré à 20 s sur les 25 plus gros flux).
  **Le piège de facture, ce sont les TripUpdates** : 202 o par course contre
  59 o par véhicule, soit **1 718 Go d'entrant par an à 30 s**, dont l'essentiel
  est la même prédiction réécrite — alors que **4 220 des 4 799 positions du
  matin nomment déjà l'arrêt où le véhicule se trouve**, ce qui donne le passage
  gratuitement dans des octets déjà téléchargés.
  Bilan sur la machine qui héberge : **≈ 15 Go en régime** (30 jours de
  positions dédupliquées, 12 mois de passages, les profils) contre **21 Go
  libres** sur un VPS partagé avec la production Enerlens — et `docker builder
  prune` rend 12,8 Go sans rien détruire. Deux scripts refont la mesure,
  `scripts/measure-pan-gtfs-rt-cost.mjs` (dont un mode `--budget` qui recalcule
  l'année sans réseau) et `scripts/measure-gtfs-service-day.mjs`.
  Le contrôle du matin a **validé la journée de service** au passage : la courbe
  des horaires prédisait 4 657 véhicules à 09 h, le balayage en a compté 4 799,
  soit +3 %. Trois autres choses apprises : **un flux qui dort ressemble
  exactement à un flux mort** (5 ressources sur 147 en échec le soir, 2
  seulement le matin — les trois URL du proxy PAN étaient revenues — et une qui
  a changé d'identifiant en sept jours) ; le plafond `CHRONICLE_MAX_SERIES` de
  250 ne passe pas l'échelle nationale, qui en demande 441 ; et la nuit coûte
  le plancher — 259 Ko par balayage sont dus quelle que soit la flotte, donc
  éteindre de 1 h à 5 h ne rendrait que ~10 % de l'entrant.

### Changed
- **Le dépôt a changé de propriétaire GitHub : `Enerlens/gods-eye-view` devient
  `mml-studio/gods-eye-view`.** « Enerlens » est le nom d'une entreprise, pas
  celui d'un compte de projets personnels ; le nom libéré est repris aussitôt
  comme organisation, ce qui **tue les redirections** `github.com/Enerlens/*`
  au lieu de les laisser vivre — d'où le remplacement des trois seules
  références en dur : le `REPO` par défaut de l'agent de déploiement
  (`deploy/vps/gev-deploy.sh`), qui tire le tarball depuis codeload, et les deux
  User-Agent de courtoisie envoyés à Overpass et à Météo-France. À l'inverse,
  les mentions de `gev.enerlens.com` et du « VPS Enerlens » **ne bougent pas** :
  ce sont un domaine et une machine, pas une identité GitHub. L'attribution des
  commits survit sans rien faire, l'adresse noreply étant préfixée par l'id
  numérique du compte et non par son login.
- **La chronique QualiCharge a son régime mesuré, et il est deux fois et demie
  moins cher que l'estimation.** Une fois la ligne de base de démarrage passée,
  un sondage en régime journalise **3 295 transitions en 14 minutes — 122 Ko en
  clair, 28 Ko compressés**, contre 75 456 transitions et 2 831 Ko pour la ligne
  de base. Soit ~316 000 transitions et ~12 Mo par jour là où la journée
  synthétique de `docs/CHRONIQUE.md` en supposait 30. Corollaire noté au même
  endroit : **un redémarrage coûte 23 sondages**, près de six heures
  d'enregistrement en octets, et le staging redéploie à chaque poussée — donc
  « le journal a doublé » se vérifie sur `State.StartedAt` avant de se
  diagnostiquer.

### Fixed
- **La fiche d'adresse répondait « aucun carreau INSEE habité » pour TOUTE
  adresse de Martinique et de La Réunion.** `implantationFeed.js` perdait le
  `crs` du carreau en inversant la grille INSEE, qui grille la métropole en
  EPSG:3035, la Martinique en 5490 et La Réunion en 2975. Un carreau réunionnais
  inversé avec le défaut métropolitain revient à **93,9° O / 55,5° N — la baie
  d'Hudson** : tous les carreaux tombaient hors de tous les anneaux, et la
  jointure rendait zéro sans jamais échouer. Trouvé par la campagne du barème,
  qui a tiré La Réunion en premier et essuyé **seize refus d'affilée** avant que
  quelqu'un regarde. Première mesure réunionnaise après correctif : 0,59 km²,
  936 habitants.
- **Le compose du VPS ne se met pas à jour tout seul, et ça avait désarmé le
  seul enregistreur qui ne dépend de personne.** L'agent de déploiement remplace
  la source à chaque tour mais lance `docker compose up -d --build` avec le
  `/opt/gev/docker-compose.yml` **de la boîte**, qu'il ne réécrit jamais. La
  chronique a donc fusionné le 2026-09-07 avec `CHRONICLE_IRVE_DYNAMIC: 1` dans
  le compose du dépôt pendant que celui du VPS datait du 2026-09-01 : le sondeur
  QualiCharge est resté **désarmé une journée**, sans erreur ni journal, la
  façade ayant exactement la même tête. Le fichier a été recopié et le conteneur
  recréé le 2026-09-08 ; le premier sondage a journalisé **75 454 points de
  charge dont 51 162 frais (67,8 %)** et écrit ses 2,9 Mo de ligne de base,
  exactement ce que `docs/CHRONIQUE.md` annonçait. `docs/DEPLOY.md` porte
  désormais la manœuvre et la règle : après une fusion censée changer
  l'environnement, lire `armed`, pas GitHub.
## [Unreleased] — 2026-09-07

### Changed
- **Un aéroport cesse d'être une punaise et redevient ses pistes.** La couche
  **Aéroports** dépensait la totalité de son budget graphique — la taille du
  point *et* sa clarté — sur un seul seau à quatre valeurs, le `type` éditorial
  d'OurAirports. Or le README du paquet dit lui-même ce qu'est ce seau :
  « driven mostly by traffic and **runway length** ». La mesure était dans le
  paquet, sur 82 % des terrains, et n'atteignait jamais l'écran. Trois canaux
  la remplacent, un par information.

  **La taille du point porte la longueur de piste publiée**, en quatre classes
  à seuils gelés (C1) choisies sur l'exploitation et non sur des quantiles :
  3 000 m et plus (18 px, 1 280 terrains), 1 800 – 2 999 m (13 px, 2 577 — un
  A320 demande ~1 800 m), 1 000 – 1 799 m (9 px, 1 690), moins de 1 000 m
  (6 px, 603). **La teinte reste le palier** et ne dit plus que lui.

  **Les 1 314 terrains dont OurAirports ne publie aucune longueur reçoivent un
  anneau creux**, pas un petit disque : « non publié » n'est pas « court », et
  le diamètre de l'anneau (8 px) n'est atteignable par aucune classe mesurée.
  C'est la règle A1, dessinée — et c'est le préalable de tout le reste, sans
  quoi faire porter une valeur à la marque transformerait 1 314 silences en
  affirmations.

  **La piste elle-même est tracée.** OurAirports publie les deux seuils de
  chaque piste et sa largeur, ce qui fait de l'aéroport le seul objet du globe
  qui ait une forme orientée à l'échelle vraie. 6 698 pistes sur 4 790
  terrains, +304 Ko sur un paquet qui passe de 2,42 à 2,73 Mo. **Une marque,
  deux planchers, trois régimes**, continus aux deux passages parce qu'un
  plancher déjà dépassé ne fait rien : loin, la longueur est tenue au diamètre
  de sa propre pastille — c'est le tiret orienté, gradué par classe ; à moyenne
  distance la longueur et le cap sont **vrais** ; de près l'épaisseur du trait
  atteint la largeur publiée de la piste. Roissy dessine ses cinq bandes, deux
  doublets parallèles et la voie hélico `08H/26H` de 443 m sur 30 — celle-là
  même que le README passait une page à excuser, et qui s'explique toute seule
  une fois dessinée à l'échelle.

  Deux bornes, dérivées et non choisies : une piste **secondaire** n'apparaît
  qu'une fois le pixel sous 45 m — la largeur médiane publiée, donc le point où
  deux bandes cessent d'être séparables ; et toute piste que le plancher
  étirerait au-delà du **double** de sa longueur vraie n'est pas dessinée du
  tout, parce qu'au-delà la marque est plus symbole que mesure et que la
  pastille porte déjà la même classe. À 260 km, Roissy tient un tiret et
  Toussus-le-Noble n'en a pas.

  **Deux lignes de piste sur trois mille sont refusées**, et les deux refus
  sont des tests de cohérence entre deux nombres publiés séparément, pas des
  jugements : 128 pistes dont l'écart entre la distance seuil-à-seuil et le
  `length_ft` publié dépasse 25 % — l'un des deux est faux, et une piste tracée
  depuis un mauvais seuil est une piste au mauvais endroit —, et 1 piste dont
  le milieu est à plus de 10 km de son propre aéroport, à 36 008 m exactement,
  ce qui est une jointure ratée et pas un long taxiway.

  **L'asymétrie est la contrainte de conception, et elle est épinglée par un
  test.** 93 % des grands aéroports ont une géométrie, et **8 % des aéroclubs**
  — 89 sur 1 126, tous français. Le long tail français, qui est la raison
  d'être de la clause (c), est exactement la moitié qu'OurAirports n'a jamais
  géoréférencée. La piste ne peut donc jamais devenir le signe principal de
  cette couche : elle en effacerait 92 % au profit d'une carte du monde qui a,
  elle, ses coordonnées. C'est la pastille qui parle pour eux.

- **La marque d'un aérodrome a désormais une portée d'affichage, et la légende
  la dit.** Le palier *Aérodrome & aéroclub* est français à 100 % par
  construction. Dessiné depuis l'orbite, il rapportait une densité
  d'aérodromes qui appartient à la **sélection** et pas au monde, juste à côté
  d'une Allemagne que le paquet laisse vide exprès — c'est le vide de type (b)
  de la règle A4, jamais déclaré. Les quatre paliers déclarent maintenant leur
  distance d'apparition : 14 000 / 7 500 / 3 000 / **900 km**. Le 900 n'est pas
  un goût : la France fait environ 1 000 km, et 1 000 km remplissent une
  fenêtre de 1 080 px à ~870 km. Les aéroclubs arrivent exactement quand la
  France est le sujet du cadre. Chaque portée est imprimée dans la légende de
  la rangée, parce que rien à l'écran ne peut la dire autrement.

- **La tige de rappel des aéroports est plafonnée à 150 m.** Toutes les couches
  locales tiennent leur pastille à 65 px constants au-dessus du sol, ce qui
  fait de la hauteur de la tige, *en mètres*, `0,0695 × distance caméra` :
  695 m à 10 km, 3 475 m à 50 km, 13 900 m à 200 km. Pour un barrage c'est un
  artifice de lecture. Au-dessus d'un aéroport c'est une affirmation — les
  couches de vols dessinent les avions à leur altitude réelle au-dessus des
  mêmes pistes, si bien que la pastille flottait au FL114 au milieu du trafic
  en approche et au FL228 au-dessus : deux longueurs verticales, deux registres,
  une seule colonne de pixels (F7). 150 m passe sous les 300 m (1 000 ft AGL)
  du tour de piste, donc la marque ne peut plus atteindre une hauteur à
  laquelle un avion se pilote. Le plafond est une option de couche
  (`stemMaxHeightM`) et n'est posé que là.

### Fixed
- **Une seconde géométrie dans un `PolylineCollection` se paie à chaque image,
  pas à chaque arrêt de caméra.** La première version des tracés de piste posait
  une polyligne Cesium par piste — 6 698 objets résidents dont on basculait le
  `show`. Une collection téléverse pourtant *toutes* ses polylignes dans un seul
  tampon et dessine le lot en une commande : `show: false` est un attribut par
  sommet, donc une polyligne masquée coûte quand même ses sommets dans le
  shader. Mesuré contre `origin/main` dans la même session, caméra parquée à
  260 km, couche allumée : l'image stable passait de **0,6 à 6,9 ms** de
  médiane. Corrigé par un **pool** de polylignes réutilisées, dimensionné à ce
  qui est à l'écran (11 à 88) et non à ce que le paquet contient. Retour à
  0,7 ms. Le repère qui a désigné le coupable : le surcoût ne bougeait pas avec
  le nombre de pistes dessinées — identique à 2 000 km, où il y en a zéro.
- **`canvas.clientHeight` était lu une fois par enregistrement et par arrêt de
  caméra.** C'est une lecture de layout DOM, et la passe de géométrie des
  couches locales en faisait 7 464 par arrêt — depuis toujours pour la tige de
  rappel, et deux fois par enregistrement dès qu'il fallait aussi placer une
  piste. Le facteur est désormais lu une fois par passe : 17,6 / 10,9 / 13,2 ms
  → **8,5 / 2,2 / 2,6 ms** à 2 000 / 260 / 60 km, contre 8,7 / 1,9 / 2,5 pour la
  référence.
- **Partager un `Material` entre polylignes était un plantage latent.**
  `Polyline._destroy()` appelle `this._material.destroy()`, et le
  `destroyObject` de Cesium n'est pas idempotent : un matériau partagé est
  détruit une fois par polyligne, et la seconde lève. Chaque polyligne a
  maintenant le sien, ce qui ne coûte rien — les *buckets* sont indexés par
  `material.type` et pas par instance, donc le lot reste un seul appel de
  dessin.
- **La capture de QA des aéroports ne cadrait rien depuis le début.** Le bloc
  qui devait poser la caméra sur l'Île-de-France lisait un global
  `window.Cesium` qui n'existe pas dans cette application, et repartait
  silencieusement sur son `if (!viewer || !Cesium) return`. La capture était
  donc prise là où le vol d'amorçage avait laissé la caméra. Les statics sont
  maintenant empruntés à une instance vivante, comme le font déjà
  `qa-cctv-v2` et `qa-height-datum`. La capture elle-même est désormais
  non bloquante : c'est de la documentation, pas un contrôle, et un compositeur
  qui se fige sur un tileset bloqué en EEE ne doit pas jeter les trois douzaines
  d'assertions déjà passées.
- **Un chip de rangée qui redonne un groupe redessine aussi sa géométrie.**
  `setParams` remettait les marqueurs visibles sans marquer la passe de
  géométrie à refaire, ce qui laissait les tracés de piste masqués jusqu'au
  prochain mouvement de caméra.

## [Unreleased] — 2026-09-03

### Added
- **Le Référentiel National des Bâtiments devient le pivot du lot adresse.**
  Jusqu'ici, tout ce que ce dépôt sait d'un bâtiment lui était rattaché par un
  point : un DPE, une vente, un permis atterrissait sur l'emprise dans laquelle
  son géocodage BAN tombait. C'est une supposition, et le géocodage BAN n'a
  jamais prétendu désigner un bâtiment — il désigne un point de rue, et il
  tombe dans la chaussée ou sur l'immeuble voisin assez souvent pour compter.
  L'État publie l'identité manquante, et **les tuiles BD TOPO que ce dépôt
  dessine déjà la portent** : `identifiants_rnb`, sur 95,5 % à 99,2 % des
  emprises tracées. La jointure se fait désormais par cet identifiant, et par
  la géométrie seulement pour ce qui n'en porte pas.
  Mesuré le 2026-09-07 sur quatre boîtes, part des diagnostics DPE qui
  atteignent un volume dessiné : **Paris 13e 81,8 % → 96,3 %**, **Lyon 2e
  40,4 % → 75,7 %**, **Marseille 78,8 % → 88,9 %**, **Ustaritz 14,0 % →
  41,5 %**. Le gain n'est pas uniforme et il n'est pas marginal : Lyon double
  presque, parce que ses géocodages BAN tombent dans la rue. Et de 2 à 83
  lignes par boîte étaient peintes sur **le mauvais toit** — la seule
  correction du lot qui change une couleur déjà affichée.
  Le compte des deux jointures est tenu séparément, sur la rangée du bâti
  (« 96 % par identifiant RNB ») et dans `getStats()`, parce qu'une couleur
  décidée par une clé publiée et une couleur décidée par un point ne sont pas
  la même affirmation — et à l'écran elles sont identiques.
  La jointure ne coûte **aucune requête** : les deux registres portent la clé.
  Le RNB n'est appelé que pour le bâtiment **sélectionné**, une fois, sans
  proxy — comme les tuiles BD TOPO, sans clé et CORS ouvert — et la fiche
  gagne alors ce que la tuile ne dit pas : les **adresses BAN** auxquelles le
  bâtiment répond et les **parcelles cadastrales** sur lesquelles il se tient.
  La carte s'affiche immédiatement sans ces lignes et se réécrit ~170 ms plus
  tard ; attendre aurait fait passer un clic pour une panne.
  Deux honnêtetés y sont câblées. Une emprise que BD TOPO publie **sans**
  identifiant (4,5 % à Paris) voit son identité résolue par proximité, et la
  fiche le dit — une identité devinée ne doit jamais se lire comme une clé
  publiée. Et une emprise qui porte **plusieurs** identifiants (65 sur 2 395 à
  Paris) les affiche tous : la fiche n'en lisait que le premier.
  La calibration est refaite, pas supposée : sur 600 bâtiments RNB de Lyon 2e,
  574 portent un identifiant `bdtopo`, et **573 sur 573** désignent le `cleabs`
  de la tuile qui porte le même identifiant RNB — zéro désaccord. Le harnais
  `npm run qa:rnb-pivot` rejoue les quatre boîtes contre les trois services
  vivants, sans navigateur ni serveur de dev.

- **La chronique — le serveur commence à garder ce que personne n'archive.**
  Presque tout ce que ce fork dessine sur la France est déjà une archive :
  Filosofi publie une année, DVF une décennie, les comptages parisiens treize
  mois glissants — et c'est parce que quelqu'un a gardé 27,7 millions de lignes
  qu'on a pu écrire que 83,9 % des arcs comptés déplacent leur heure de pointe
  le week-end. **Cinq flux que ce serveur lit déjà ne gardent rien** : un
  VehiclePositions GTFS-RT est écrasé toutes les trente secondes, QualiCharge
  remplace ses 75 427 lignes à chaque publication, un répertoire DATEX II ne
  contient que le fichier courant, un socket AIS ne se rejoue pas, et Vigicrues
  republie son bulletin par-dessus le précédent deux fois par jour. Aucun n'a
  d'historique public, et personne ne le vend pour la France.
  Un enregistreur replie désormais chacun d'eux en **semaine type de 168
  créneaux, heure de Paris**, gardée pour toujours, et conserve **trente jours de
  ticks bruts** sous `.gev-cache/chronicle/`. L'heure de Paris et pas UTC parce
  que tous ces rythmes sont humains : la pointe du soir est à 18 h locales en
  février comme en juillet, et en UTC elle se déplace d'une heure deux fois par
  an — ce qui étalerait deux mois de chaque profil sur deux créneaux et
  aplatirait précisément la pointe qu'on cherche.
  **Trente jours, parce qu'un repli est irréversible.** Un axe auquel personne
  n'a pensé le premier jour est perdu à jamais, sauf si les ticks sont encore là
  pour le reconstruire ; quatre semaines complètes suffisent à rebâtir un premier
  profil sur un axe neuf. Un jour terminé est compressé sur place — mesuré 30,2
  Mo en clair contre 4,2 Mo compressés, soit 125 Mo de mois retenu au lieu de
  900.
  **Un créneau compte des semaines distinctes, pas des échantillons**, et il
  refuse de noter quoi que ce soit en dessous de trois. Une source interrogée
  toutes les cinq minutes met douze échantillons dans un créneau en une seule
  semaine : juger sur l'effectif laisserait un mardi chargé certifier le créneau
  mardi 08 h pour toujours. Et une valeur est **notée avant d'être repliée** —
  « est-ce normal » veut dire « au regard de ce qu'on savait avant » ; noter
  après met la valeur dans sa propre espérance et tire tout vers « typique »
  (mesuré sur cinq échantillons : 1,8 σ affiché au lieu de plusieurs dizaines).
  **Vigicrues ne déclare aucune semaine type, et c'est le point.** Une crue
  répond à la pluie, pas à mardi ; replier un niveau de vigilance en créneaux
  horaires fabriquerait une saisonnalité inexistante puis noterait de vrais
  épisodes contre elle. La source garde donc sa seule chronologie, et
  `/anomalies` **refuse** en donnant la raison, au lieu de renvoyer une liste
  vide qui se lirait « rien d'anormal sur les rivières ce soir ».
  Quatre des cinq sources ne coûtent rien en amont : elles enregistrent une
  charge que le proxy avait déjà téléchargée. La cinquième est nouvelle —
  **QualiCharge**, le seul fichier national français qui dise si une borne est
  libre *maintenant* et pas seulement où elle est installée. Trois pièges y ont
  été mesurés, dont un qui change le chiffre : `horodatage` dit quand l'opérateur
  a parlé pour la dernière fois, et **seules 67,9 % des 75 427 lignes ont moins
  de 24 heures**, la plus vieille remontant à 862 jours. Les périmées ne sont pas
  muettes, elles sont affirmatives : **18 052 des 24 197 disent encore `libre`**.
  Lire le fichier tel quel donne 58 742 bornes libres, le lire honnêtement
  40 690 — **une lecture naïve gonfle la capacité de recharge libre de la France
  de 44,4 %**. Le brut y est un **journal de transitions** et pas des instantanés :
  sur 9 min 36 s, 4 231 bornes ont changé de ligne mais 1 116 n'avaient bougé que
  leur horodatage.
  Le biais est mesuré plutôt que caché : trois sources ne sont enregistrées que
  quand quelqu'un regarde, donc la couverture d'un profil est une carte de là où
  la caméra a été pointée — c'est pourquoi chaque créneau publie son nombre de
  semaines et qu'un profil maigre se lit comme maigre. Et la licence voyage avec
  chaque source : le PAN déclare de l'ODbL sur une minorité substantielle de ses
  flux temps réel, et le partage à l'identique de l'ODbL atteint toute base
  dérivée exposée publiquement, pas seulement la carte qu'on en tire.
  Lecture seule côté HTTP (`/api/chronicle-fr/status`, `/series`, `/profile`,
  `/anomalies`) ; l'écriture se fait à l'intérieur des proxys. Le sondeur
  QualiCharge est **opt-in** (`CHRONICLE_IRVE_DYNAMIC=1`, armé sur le
  déploiement de staging, qui est le seul à avoir un volume persistant).
  Raisonnement complet dans [`docs/CHRONICLE.md`](docs/CHRONICLE.md) ;
  `npm run qa:chronicle`.
- **La route d'un vol suivi, sur une seule vue.** Sélectionner un avion et
  vouloir voir d'où il vient et où il va demandait jusqu'ici de dézoomer à la
  main jusqu'à retrouver deux aéroports qu'aucun trait ne reliait. Un bouton
  **SHOW ROUTE** apparaît maintenant dans la rangée d'actions de CONTACTS —
  à côté de COCKPIT, et seulement quand il y a une route à montrer. Il fait
  deux choses. Il **recule la caméra de suivi** à la hauteur exacte qui place
  l'aéroport le plus lointain à 15° de l'axe de visée — la formule est celle du
  champ de vision, pas celle de l'horizon, parce que sous le plafond de
  12 000 km c'est toujours elle qui contraint — et il se poste sur le **flanc**
  de la liaison, pour que celle-ci traverse l'écran au lieu de s'y enfoncer.
  Un recul plein sud, lui, rejetait l'extrémité la plus proche hors du cadre
  par le bas, et laquelle des deux dépendait du cap : mesuré au premier essai
  en vol réel, Málaga à y = 996 sur 1 000. Et il **trace la liaison** entre les
  deux aéroports, en arc de grand cercle, avec une pastille nommée à chaque
  bout.
  **L'arc est le trajet prévu, pas la trace volée**, et tout dans son dessin
  sert à le dire : pointillé quand la trace est pleine, ambre quand la trace est
  cyan, bombé à 200 km d'altitude là où l'avion croise à 11, et légendé
  ESTIMATED FLIGHT PLAN en son sommet — les mots que la fiche cockpit emploie
  déjà pour la même donnée. Il n'est dessiné que si `routePlausible` accepte la
  liaison ; une réponse adsbdb portant la mauvaise étape reste masquée, et un
  arc affiché qui devient incohérent au sondage suivant disparaît de lui-même.
  **La sélection survit à l'excursion** : la caméra ne quitte jamais l'avion,
  elle recule dans son repère, donc la fiche suivie, l'entrée COCKPIT et le
  sujet de Contexte restent en place pendant les 3 000 km de recul. Un second
  appui rend le cadrage rapproché et efface l'arc. Une jambe de plus de
  3 200 km ne tient dans aucune vue d'un globe : le bouton le dit dans son
  info-bulle au lieu de laisser lire une pastille manquante comme un dessin
  raté.
  Le recul est écrit dans le `viewFrom` de l'entité suivie, pas seulement
  appliqué à la caméra : `viewFrom` est le décalage de suivi *déclaré*, et
  l'`EntityView` de Cesium le relit à chaque réinitialisation. Sans cela les
  deux se contredisaient et Cesium gagnait — la caméra revenait au cadrage
  rapproché, arc dessiné et tout, sur les essais où le bouton était pressé le
  plus tôt après la sélection.
  Vérifié en navigateur par `npm run qa:flight-route`, qui suit des contacts
  réels jusqu'à en trouver un dont l'étape est plausible, projette les deux
  aéroports à l'écran après cadrage, et vérifie qu'ils y sont tous les deux.

- **Le fond de carte Google, sur la clé même qui ne peut pas charger le globe
  3D.** Le retrait EEE de Google est plus étroit que son message d'erreur ne le
  laisse croire. Mesuré le 2026-09-03 sur la clé de production : `3dtiles/root.json`
  et `createSession mapType:satellite` répondent tous deux **403
  PERMISSION_DENIED**, mais `roadmap` et `terrain` répondent **200** avec de
  vraies tuiles. La restriction porte sur l'adresse de **facturation** et frappe
  l'*imagerie*, pas la cartographie : une installation facturée en Europe, dont
  la pastille « Google 3D » restera grise pour toujours, peut donc afficher le
  plan et le relief Google. Deux sources entrent dans le tiroir, **Plan Google**
  et **Relief Google**, en z0–20 et en tuiles 512 px, mondiales — sans jeton
  Cesium ion et sans le découpage France des sources IGN.
  Une URL de tuile 2D est invalide sans jeton de session, et ouvrir une session
  est un POST que Cesium ne sait pas faire : `/api/google/2d-session` le fait
  côté serveur, mutualise le jeton entre tous les visiteurs — Google le donne
  pour **14 jours** — et laisse les tuiles aller du navigateur à Google en
  direct, comme OSM, l'IGN et ion. Un `createSession` tous les quinze jours au
  lieu d'un par chargement de page. `mapType` est une liste blanche de deux
  valeurs, pas un passe-plat : chaque session distincte est un appel facturable,
  et demander `satellite` répond 400 en nommant le retrait EEE plutôt que de
  laisser Google répondre 403 plus loin.
  **Et le démarrage atterrit dessus.** Une installation qui a une clé mais pas de
  tuiles 3D tombait sur OSM ; elle ouvre maintenant sur le plan Google, c'est-à-dire
  sur ce qui est déjà payé. Une installation sans clé continue d'ouvrir sur OSM,
  inchangée — et `initialStack` cesse d'être écrasé quand le globe 3D manque, ce
  qui rendait le choix de l'appelant inatteignable sur les seules configurations
  qui en ont un à faire.
- **Un clic cadre la zone de chalandise, au lieu de la dessiner là où vous étiez.**
  Mesurer le sol qu'un point atteint puis en laisser un tiers sous le panneau
  DATA LAYERS, à l'altitude où la caméra se trouvait par hasard, c'était le
  calque refusant de montrer sa propre réponse une deuxième fois. La caméra vole
  désormais à l'aplomb du point, à l'altitude qui fait tenir la zone entière —
  non pas dans le canevas, mais dans **la partie du canevas qu'aucun panneau
  n'occupe** : les mêmes rectangles d'interface que le solveur de fiches évite
  déjà sont lus, les bandes de bord sont retranchées, et la zone est centrée
  dans ce qui reste. Une zone à pied et une zone en voiture sont à deux ordres
  de grandeur l'une de l'autre ; changer de mode sur un point fixé recadre.
- **La fiche s'ouvre toute seule, et elle ne recouvre plus la zone.** Une bande
  de la hauteur de la fiche est réservée en bas du cadre, et la fiche est
  accrochée au **bord inférieur de la forme** et non à son centre : le filet la
  relie au contour qu'elle décrit, et aucun pixel du lavis n'est dessous. La
  bande coûte environ un sixième du cadre — moins cher que n'importe quelle
  bande verticale, une fiche étant trois fois plus large que haute.
- **Et la fiche est titrée par l'adresse du point.** « Point fixé — à pied »
  nommait un état interne, pas le sujet du lecteur. Le proxy géocode le point à
  l'envers via la **BAN** et la fiche porte la voie quand la première adresse est
  à moins de 120 m, la commune au-delà — avec la distance dite, sans quoi un nom
  de commune se lirait comme plus précis qu'il n'est — et la coordonnée quand il
  n'y a ni l'une ni l'autre. Le texte est resserré pour la même raison que la
  bande existe : chaque caractère de la fiche est de la largeur que la zone
  n'obtient pas. La lecture d'expansion, elle, garde sa phrase entière sur la
  fiche de chaque anneau.

- **Le bâti porte enfin le thème : DPE, prix au m² et permis peints sur les
  volumes.** Quatre couches parlaient d'un bâtiment en dessinant une punaise
  au-dessus de son toit, pendant que `Bâti 3D` extrudait les volumes réels de la
  France pour lui seul. La lettre DPE peinte est le **mode** des diagnostics de
  l'immeuble, égalité tranchée par la pire : la moyenne donnerait `D` pour
  `B,B,F`, une lettre qu'aucun diagnostic ne porte, sur une échelle dont les
  classes ne sont pas équidistantes. Un volume sans donnée est lavé à **ΔE76 ≥ 36**
  de toutes les palettes, mesuré : il ne peut pas être lu comme une classe.
- **Les effectifs quittent l'aplat et montent sur l'axe Z.** Bornes de recharge,
  écoles, enseignement supérieur et mix électrique dessinent des **prismes** :
  hauteur = l'effectif absolu, couleur = le taux. Peindre un effectif brut en
  aplat est la faute que le corpus de sémiologie appelle « l'une des plus
  courantes du géoweb », et elle était ici quatre fois. Les domaines sont gelés
  et mesurés — 12 000 points de charge, 2 600 établissements — jamais le maximum
  de la charge utile, sans quoi la couleur d'un département dépendrait de la
  présence des autres.
- **Les séismes sont dessinés à leur profondeur.** Le disque valait
  `2^magnitude × 1000` mètres, ce qui ne mesurait ni la rupture, ni le rayon
  ressenti, ni rien — et la profondeur était codée rouge→orange→jaune, qui se lit
  comme une gravité : un foyer à 600 km était peint « faible ». La profondeur est
  maintenant une géométrie, la magnitude un anneau en pixels constants, et la
  couleur est rendue à l'âge de l'événement.
- **Un curseur horaire sur les comptages routiers de Paris.** La couche
  détenait 2 977 arcs × 168 heures et en peignait une seule, la moyenne de
  l'heure ouvrée. La teinte, libérée, porte la **forme du rythme** mesurée sur la
  semaine : nocturne 56 · week-end 100 · pendulaire 367 · pointe du matin 150 ·
  pointe du soir 652 · continu 369 · indéterminé 36.
- **Le canal taille rendu à quatre jeux.** Un navire de 400 m et un remorqueur de
  12 m avaient la même flèche, alors que l'AIS publie la coque — 18,0 % des
  contacts, mesuré sur le flux réel. Les datacenters rendaient tous le même point
  de 10 px alors que leur emprise couvre cinq ordres de grandeur. La houle et la
  hauteur des pylônes ANFR (couverture mesurée : 99,24 %) prennent la verticale.

### Changed
- **L'index des transports français a été remesuré.** `config/pan_gtfs_rt_feeds.json`
  datait du 2026-08-31 : c'est le fichier qui dit à la couche Transports en
  commun quels réseaux existent et *où* leurs véhicules ont été vus, le
  catalogue national ne publiant sa couverture que sous forme de nom. Les trois
  index sont repassés le 2026-09-07 à 17 h 10, un lundi en heure de pointe —
  la même tranche que la mesure de référence, pour que les flottes soient
  comparables.
  Le catalogue est passé de 784 jeux à **782**, et le nombre de ressources
  déclarant `vehicle_positions` n'a pas bougé — **150** — ce qui masque six
  entrées et six sorties : arrivent **Sankéo** (Perpignan, 59 véhicules),
  **Rémi Centre-Val de Loire** sous une ressource re-frappée (104, contre 3
  pour l'ancienne), **Némus** (Flers, 23), **TUM** (Mende), **Hoplà** (Oise)
  et Saint-Sulpice-la-Pointe ; partent cinq réseaux qui ont cessé de déclarer
  des positions — dont Tempobus, Val d'Isère et le Réseau Nord de Martinique,
  tous à zéro véhicule depuis la mesure précédente — et l'ancienne ressource de
  Rémi. **148 réseaux sur 150 portent désormais une emprise observée** contre
  144, et **63 publient des alertes** contre 60. Les trois doublons confirmés
  le 2026-08-31 le sont restés, et aucun flux n'est en quarantaine.
  Les deux index dérivés suivent : `pan_gtfs_static.json` (147 flux, la trace
  de ligne et les arrêts d'une course) et `pan_route_types.json` (143 réseaux,
  6 988 lignes), sans quoi les six réseaux entrants auraient roulé sans classe
  de véhicule ni tracé. La classe se résout maintenant pour **94,0 %** de la
  flotte nationale mesurée en pointe (7 171 véhicules), et le taux de jointure
  moyen des retards passe de 0,92 sur 79 réseaux à **0,97 sur 134** — l'écart
  est l'heure, pas le code : la mesure d'août avait été prise le soir, quand la
  moitié des réseaux sont rentrés au dépôt.
  Trois navettes de station — Tignes, l'Alpe d'Huez, Valmobus — publient hors
  saison un `routes.txt` sans colonne `route_type` exploitable et perdent leur
  carte de lignes ; elles ne rapportaient aucun véhicule ce jour-là, et la
  raison est écrite par réseau dans `unresolved` au lieu d'être avalée.
- **Le budget qui donne sa silhouette à un avion, redimensionné sur une mesure
  au lieu d'une intuition.** L'enrichissement *ambiant* — celui qui classe les
  avions qu'on n'a pas cliqués — puise dans un seau de jetons. Il en tenait
  **300**, rechargés de **150 toutes les 5 minutes**. Ces deux nombres avaient
  été posés le 2026-07-03, quand une requête `adsbdb` rationnée était le
  **seul** chemin vers un code type ; le plan de la phase 3a demandait de les
  relever « une fois (1) livré **et mesuré** ». La mesure n'avait pas été
  faite.
  `npm run qa:enrich-budget` la fait, en direct sur le flux amont, parce que
  les deux boutons répondent à deux questions différentes : le **plafond**
  finance la *première vue* d'une région — combien d'avions en vol s'affichent
  d'un coup — et la **recharge** finance le *renouvellement* — combien de
  contacts nouveaux entrent par tranche de 5 minutes. Sous-dimensionner le
  premier, c'est regarder une région se classer pendant le quart d'heure qui
  suit ; sous-dimensionner la seconde, c'est vider le seau pour de bon, ce qui
  est le bogue de juillet au ralenti. Relevé le 2026-09-07, trois régions,
  13 minutes, cercle de 250 NM, contacts en vol seulement — les deux filtres
  du balayage :

  | région | première vue | nouveaux / 5 min | portant `t` |
  | --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
  | Francfort | 919 | 126 | 96,4 % |
  | Paris | 795 | 120 | 97,3 % |
  | Los Angeles | 223 | 48 | 98,2 % |

  **La mesure a déplacé un seul des deux boutons, et c'est tout l'intérêt de
  mesurer.** Le plafond de 300 couvrait **un tiers** d'une première vue sur la
  région la plus dense : une vue européenne fraîche vidait son seau en deux
  sondages, puis classait le reste à la vitesse de la recharge — un quart
  d'heure de flotte à moitié dessinée. Il passe à **1 000**, juste au-dessus des
  919 relevés. La **recharge ne bouge pas** : 150 par 5 minutes couvre déjà le
  pire renouvellement mesuré (126), et c'est de surcroît le frein sur le cas que
  le cercle ne voit pas — un visiteur qui *déplace* la caméra paie une première
  vue à chaque région, et passé le seau initial, cette cadence-là *est* ce
  nombre. La doubler sans preuve n'aurait rien apporté de perceptible et aurait
  dépensé l'API gratuite de quelqu'un d'autre pour le faire.
  **Et le même relevé dit où passait le budget.** Environ 97 % des contacts
  d'un flux adsb.lol portent déjà leur désignateur ICAO depuis la phase 3a, et
  le balayage les redemandait quand même à `adsbdb` : un jeton rationné dépensé
  pour le nom long du modèle, sur une fiche que personne n'a ouverte. Il ne les
  demande plus. Cliquer un avion — ou s'en approcher assez pour qu'il passe en
  3D — l'enrichit toujours, en priorité et hors de ce budget.
  **Rien de tout cela n'accélère les requêtes.** La cadence reste bornée par la
  goutte-à-goutte (≤ 5/s) et par les 150 mises en file par sondage, soit
  ≤ 300/min. adsbdb tolère 512 requêtes par 60 s glissantes avant un 429 d'une
  minute, et 300 s de blocage au-delà de 1 024 (`mrjackwills/adsbdb`,
  `src/db_redis/ratelimit.rs`). Ce que le seau borne, c'est le **total** d'une
  session, pas son débit.

- **Le bruit des aéroports, dézoomé, n'est plus dessiné à la serpe.** Vue de
  loin, une zone de bruit était un polygone à facettes ; la même zone, vue de
  près, était une courbe propre. Ce n'étaient pas deux rendus du même contour,
  c'étaient **deux géométries différentes**. Le service DGAC généralise le
  tracé qu'il renvoie à l'échelle de rendu demandée, et la vue d'ensemble la
  demandait cent fois plus grossière : mesuré, la zone C de Roissy revenait avec
  **381 sommets de près et 22 de loin**, sa zone D avec 664 contre 37 — un
  anneau de 65,8 km de large dessiné avec trente-sept points.
  Et ce n'était pas un réglage à corriger, parce que **ce chiffre faisait deux
  métiers à la fois**. C'est lui qui élargit le tampon de la requête, et sans ce
  tampon large les zones B, C et D — des anneaux qui n'entourent pas le point
  interrogé — ne reviennent tout simplement pas : à l'échelle fine, Roissy ne
  rend pas sa zone D et Toussus perd sa zone B. Affiner le tracé revenait à
  perdre les zones qu'on avait dézoomé pour voir.
  Les deux besoins sont désormais séparés en **deux passes**. La première, large,
  ne sert plus qu'à **nommer** les zones présentes ; chaque zone nommée est
  ensuite **redemandée à l'échelle fine**, visée sur son propre contour — ce qui
  marche parce que le service ne découpe pas la géométrie qu'il renvoie au cadre
  par lequel on l'interroge. Mesuré sur 50 aérodromes et 170 zones, la seconde
  passe en récupère **170 sur 170**. Sur les douze aérodromes autour de Paris,
  le dessin passe de **1 399 à 12 045 sommets**.
  **Personne n'attend cette seconde passe.** Elle coûte environ neuf secondes à
  froid, ce qui n'est pas un temps de recentrage de caméra : la vue large
  s'affiche immédiatement comme avant — complète, toutes les zones présentes —
  et **s'affine sous l'œil** quelques secondes plus tard, aérodrome par
  aérodrome. La ligne de guidage l'annonce (« contours en cours d'affinage »)
  pour que le lecteur qui voit le trait bouger sache pourquoi. Le résultat est
  gardé un mois par aérodrome, sur disque : le registre national ne compte que
  224 aérodromes et n'a gagné que 8 arrêtés en six ans, donc c'est payé une fois.
  Au passage, un en-tête corrigé sur **les six calques d'adresse** : la route
  répondait `Cache-Control: private, max-age=300` à toute réponse, ce qui est
  juste pour une réponse sur une adresse — elle ne change pas pendant qu'on la
  regarde — et rendait le rafraîchissement ci-dessus **entièrement inopérant**.
  Mesuré dans un vrai navigateur : les relances toutes les cinq secondes étaient
  servies par le cache HTTP, aucune n'atteignait le serveur, et le dessin restait
  à 72 zones grossières pendant toute la session pendant que le proxy terminait
  ses 18 aérodromes en vingt secondes. L'en-tête suit désormais la durée de vie
  réelle de la réponse.
  **Et la fiche ne promet jamais plus que ce qui est dessiné.** Chaque zone
  transporte l'échelle à laquelle son propre contour a été récupéré ; la fiche
  annonce **la plus grossière** — la seule vraie de toutes les formes à l'écran
  — et dit combien sont déjà affinées, plutôt que d'aplatir un dessin mixte sur
  un seul chiffre.

- **La plaisance et la voile cessent d'être « Type non déclaré ».** Mesuré le
  2026-09-07 sur le flux réel, boîte France, 1 696 contacts : 500 portaient un
  type, dont 187 le code AIS **0** — « non disponible », donc muets à juste
  titre. Sur les 313 qui déclaraient vraiment quelque chose, **153 étaient
  peints dans l'ardoise des muets** parce que la palette n'avait aucun motif
  pour leur code. Les deux premiers, à eux seuls, valent 94 contacts : **36
  (voile) et 37 (plaisance)** — sur une côte, la déclaration la plus fréquente
  qui soit. Ils prennent une sixième famille, *Plaisance et voile*, en violet
  `#a78bfa`, hors des cinq teintes existantes comme du gris ardoise réservé à
  ceux qui n'ont rien dit. La légende étant décomptée sur les seuls navires à
  l'écran, elle n'apparaît que là où il y en a. Confirmé le même jour sur un
  relevé plus large — 3 252 contacts, 1 019 déclarations exploitables : **230
  d'entre elles sont de la plaisance ou de la voile**, et la part des
  déclarations correctement nommées passe de 57 % à 80 %.
  Restent dans le seau sans nom, et c'est volontaire : le code 0, les 37 codes
  9x (« autre type, sans précision »), et 22 contacts épars — dragage, grande
  vitesse, SAR, police, militaire, servitude portuaire — trop peu nombreux ici
  pour leur inventer une teinte sans décision de conception.

- **Le flux navires écoute la France, plus la planète entière.** La
  souscription AISStream s'ouvrait sur `[[[-90,-180],[90,180]]]` : tous les
  messages AIS de la Terre dans un seul websocket. Or les messages d'identité
  sont ceux qui perdent la course quand le tuyau sature, et l'identité est
  exactement ce qui manquait à la carte. Le défaut devient **la France
  métropolitaine et ses approches** — `[[[41,-8],[51.6,10]]]`, du rail
  d'Ouessant au pas de Calais, golfe du Lion et Corse compris : ~3 750 contacts
  au lieu de ~18 300, même cadence statique par navire, cinq fois moins de trafic
  pour la faire passer. Combinée au registre qui survit désormais aux
  redémarrages, la part de types déclarés monte de session en session au lieu de
  se réinitialiser. La boîte est **métropolitaine** : les DOM-TOM n'y sont pas,
  et c'est dit là où la constante est écrite. Une ligne de `.env` rend le monde
  entier (`AISSTREAM_BOUNDING_BOXES`), et plusieurs boîtes peuvent être listées.
  Le chien de garde de silence, qui ne s'armait que « si aucune variable n'est
  posée », juge maintenant la **souscription résolue** : il s'arme pour les deux
  boîtes dont ce dépôt a mesuré le débit — la France et le monde —, non filtrées.
  L'ancienne règle le désarmait pour quiconque écrivait la boîte mondiale à la
  main, c'est-à-dire sur la souscription la plus bavarde qui soit.

- **La légende quitte le coin de la carte et prend la tête du rail droit.** Elle
  était une plaque fixe en bas à gauche, et une règle de feuille de style
  l'**éteignait** dès qu'on ouvrait DATA LAYERS
  (`body:has(#data-panel:not(.collapsed)) .map-legend { display: none }`). Ce
  panneau l'aurait de toute façon recouverte — mais avec des dizaines de calques
  à parcourir, on perdait la clé au moment précis où l'on en avait besoin.
  Décision du propriétaire : lire la carte prime sur le panneau qui la cachait.
  La clé devient donc **le premier membre de `#right-context-rail`**, au-dessus
  de DISPLAY, CCTV et CONTEXT, dépliée par défaut — dans la seule colonne que
  DATA LAYERS n'atteint jamais —, et la règle disparaît avec le conflit qui la
  justifiait. C'est un panneau à part entière : chevron de repli, état retenu
  sous `v6`, jeton de partage `e`, et **première place dans l'ordre
  d'allocation**, la seule que `panelStackAutoCollapseIndices` ne replie jamais
  d'office. `#map-legend-items` est la surface qui défile sous la hauteur
  allouée. La *génération* de la légende n'a pas bougé d'une ligne : la même
  passe alimente toujours les entrées en ligne du panneau et ce montage-ci.
  Trois choses ont été trouvées au navigateur et non à la relecture. **La clé
  débordait de l'écran** — 1 400 px de haut dans une fenêtre de 900 — parce que
  l'allocation du rail est écrite par une passe planifiée en `requestAnimationFrame`
  et qu'une scène Cesium en `requestRenderMode` devenue inerte ne produit plus
  de trame : elle a désormais un plafond CSS qui tient sans la passe. **Une clé
  ouverte faisait disparaître les onglets DISPLAY, CCTV et CONTEXT**, le HUD
  tactique masquant les lanceurs repliés dès qu'un panneau est déplié : la
  légende ne compte plus comme un panneau que l'opérateur a ouvert, puisqu'elle
  s'ouvre parce qu'un calque est allumé. Et **en Cockpit**, où le rail est
  masqué et où sa colonne accueille les lanceurs DISPLAY et RADIO, la clé
  retrouve le coin en bas à gauche qu'elle occupait avant.
- **L'effet bloom est retiré du produit.** Décision du propriétaire : on enlève
  le bloom, et rien d'autre du panneau DISPLAY. Partent la passe globale
  `scene.postProcessStages.bloom`, son bouton et son curseur, `src/bloom.js`, la
  façade `setBloom`, la moitié `bloom` de l'outil vocal `set_post_processing` et
  les jetons de partage `bloom` / `bi` / `bv`. **Aucun rendu ne change** : elle
  était livrée à `enabled: false, intensity: 0`. À ne pas confondre avec les
  uniformes `bloom` des nuanceurs NVG et thermique — des paramètres de preset,
  pas la passe — qui restent, jeton `b` compris. Les liens de partage écrits
  avant le retrait s'ouvrent toujours : un jeton inconnu n'est simplement jamais
  lu. Sharpen, HUD, DETECT, PARAMETERS, 3D, Scope, Celestial et Clean UI restent
  en place, et le panneau reste dans le rail droit.
- **La légende des avions se lit en français.** Les onze libellés de classe
  partagés par le calque civil et le calque militaire étaient en anglais sous
  une interface française — « Type not reported », « Light aircraft ». Ils
  passent aux termes que la langue emploie vraiment : **monocouloir**,
  **gros-porteur**, **quadriréacteur lourd**. `unknown` se dit désormais « Type
  non déclaré », mot pour mot comme les calques maritimes le disent déjà, pour
  qu'une même idée n'ait qu'une seule formulation dans le produit. `fastjet`
  reste **« Jet rapide »** et non « avion de combat » : cette classe s'atteint
  aussi depuis la catégorie 7 d'OpenSky, qui est une lecture de *vitesse* —
  la nommer par la mission affirmerait ce que la donnée ne dit pas, exactement
  ce que la pastille ambre refuse déjà de faire. Les mentions voisines de la
  même légende suivent : contact suivi, plage OACI militaire, et les contacts
  tenus **à l'estime** entre deux sondages.
- **DATA LAYERS et SCENES cessent d'être noir sur noir.** Les panneaux avaient
  été réglés sur les tuiles photoréalistes, où une plaque quasi noire à 72 %
  et un filet blanc à 8 % suffisent : la ville dessous fait la séparation. Mais
  les lanceurs repliés vivent dans les couloirs latéraux, **hors du masque de
  visée**, donc sur `--bg-dark`, c'est-à-dire sur rien. Mesuré là, l'ancien
  réglage donnait **1,01:1** pour la plaque et **1,18:1** pour son bord : les
  panneaux n'étaient pas discrets, ils étaient arithmétiquement absents, et
  seul le bouton d'ouverture les signalait. Le verre passe à `rgba(30, 37, 49,
  .82)` et son filet à `rgba(126, 176, 204, .28)` — **1,21:1** et **1,65:1**
  sur le pire fond de l'application, soit `#1a202b` une fois composité : un
  HUD toujours sombre, et toujours du verre (l'alpha va de 0,72 à 0,82, pas à
  1).
- **Et les titres de panneau repassent au-dessus du seuil de lisibilité.** À
  9 px interlettrés de 3 px, `DATA LAYERS` mesurait **2,37:1** sur sa propre
  plaque, à peu près la moitié des 4,5:1 qu'exige une typographie de cette
  taille. Les deux niveaux atténués montent ensemble pour que la hiérarchie
  survive à la remontée — `dim` 0,30 → 0,52 (**4,65:1**), `secondary` 0,50 →
  0,68 — et les commandes qui portent leur propre fond, donc éclaircissent le
  fond sous leur glyphe, prennent le niveau supérieur : bouton d'ouverture,
  pastille `OFF` d'une couche, invite `SELECT CONTEXT`, graduations du ruban de
  cap. Après passage, **aucun texte ni aucune plaque de l'interface ne reste
  sous son seuil**, panneaux repliés comme dépliés.

- **Les fiches délinquance disent enfin 6,22 DE QUOI.** La ligne de valeur
  affichait « 6,22 pour 1 000 habitants · 2 597 faits » — un nombre que personne
  ne peut lire, et un nom faux : le SSMSI compte les escroqueries en VICTIMES,
  les cambriolages en INFRACTIONS, les vols de véhicule en VÉHICULES et les
  stupéfiants en MIS EN CAUSE. Quatre unités sur cinq ne sont pas des faits. La
  fiche dit maintenant **« 2 597 victimes, soit 6,22 pour 1 000 habitants »**,
  dans l'unité que le registre publie, accordée au nombre — et le total calculé,
  qui n'a pas d'unité à lui, dit **« 230 892 cumulés (14 indicateurs) »** plutôt
  que d'emprunter celle d'un autre.
- **Et elles tiennent en un écran sans qu'on ait à les enrouler.** Mesurée sur
  la Dordogne, une fiche faisait 858 caractères dont 558 de citation — la même,
  mot pour mot, sur chaque fiche du même indicateur — pour quatre nombres
  utiles ; l'enroulement à 420 px la rend lisible, mais en colonne d'une
  vingtaine de lignes. La fiche par défaut fait **351 caractères sur 8 lignes**,
  une ligne par affirmation, 60 caractères au plus : sous le plafond, donc
  dessinée telle qu'elle est écrite, aucune phrase coupée en son milieu.
- **Rien n'a été retiré, seulement raccourci.** La délinquance ENREGISTRÉE,
  l'écart de dépôt de plainte 12 % → 74 %, la condition de trois ans du secret
  statistique, le comptage au domicile de la victime, et pour le total la
  mention qu'il est CALCULÉ par God's Eye View et non publié par le SSMSI : tous
  là, une ligne chacun au lieu d'un paragraphe.
- **Une puce « Méthodo » rend les règles du SSMSI, mot pour mot.** Elle est la
  contrepartie de la fiche compacte : un lecteur qui veut vérifier ce qu'une
  ligne courte résume clique, et la fiche DÉJÀ OUVERTE se redessine avec les
  citations intégrales, la définition exacte de la moyenne départementale et
  l'inventaire complet des autres indicateurs — sinon il faudrait refermer la
  fiche et retrouver sa commune. Elle ne voyage pas dans le lien de partage :
  une vue partagée s'ouvre toujours compacte.

- **Une ligne de légende qui nomme un canal n'imprime plus « undefined ».** Le
  panneau concaténait un compte absent ; la légende sur carte gardait déjà. Le
  chantier multipliait ces entrées — « 1 m de houle → 10 km », « Taille du
  point — magnitude » — donc le défaut devenait systématique.
- **Une pastille de motif est visible.** Une entrée combinant une couleur nulle
  et un glyphe masquait un fond que personne ne posait : un carré transparent de
  14 px, là où la doctrine exige un motif pour l'absence de donnée.
- **DVF colore contre le médian de la commune, pas contre celui de l'écran.** La
  même vente changeait de couleur quand la caméra bougeait. Le dénominateur est
  nommé dans la légende et sur chaque fiche.

### Fixed
- **Un réseau ne disparaît plus de l'index parce que le catalogue l'a cru
  injoignable une minute.** Le Point d'Accès National publie deux choses très
  différentes sur une ressource : ce qu'elle **est** (son format et ses
  `features`, que seul l'éditeur change) et si le PAN a **réussi à la joindre**
  à l'instant (`is_available`). La construction de l'index lisait les deux de
  la même façon, et laissait donc le second décider de l'appartenance.
  Or ce drapeau bat. Mesuré le 2026-09-07 : la ressource 81755 — le flux urbain
  de **TaM, le réseau principal de Montpellier** — était marquée injoignable
  lors de la lecture de catalogue de 17 h 10, et joignable de nouveau deux
  minutes plus tard. La première construction l'a donc **supprimée** du fichier
  livré, avec son emprise observée, son historique de santé et ses ressources
  compagnes, sur un tirage à pile ou face. Le flux répondait : sondé à 17 h 18,
  il rapportait **178 véhicules**, sa plus grosse flotte de l'année.
  L'ironie est que le script savait déjà traiter une panne : un flux qui échoue
  au sondage est mis en quarantaine — retiré de la sélection, gardé dans le
  fichier, ressuscité par n'importe quel succès ultérieur. C'était la
  *déclaration* du catalogue qui était traitée plus durement que la mesure.
  Les trois constructions lisent maintenant la déclaration de l'éditeur, et
  laissent le sondage juger de la joignabilité. Un éditeur qui cesse de
  déclarer `vehicle_positions` sort toujours de l'index — c'est une phrase, pas
  une panne — et c'est bien ce qui est arrivé aux cinq réseaux partis ce
  jour-là.
- **Ce que le serveur apprend d'un navire lui survit enfin.** « Type non
  déclaré » n'était pas un défaut d'affichage : l'AIS coupe un navire en deux.
  Les messages de position — 1/2/3 et 18, ceux dont la carte est faite — ne
  portent **ni type, ni nom, ni numéro IMO, ni dimensions**. Tout cela ne voyage
  que dans le message 5 et dans la partie B du message 24, qu'un transpondeur
  émet toutes les six minutes environ (le 19, extension Classe B rare, en porte
  une partie ; il ne change pas l'ordre de grandeur). Le serveur l'avait compris et fusionnait
  correctement les deux familles, dans les deux sens — mais dans une `Map` de
  mémoire de processus que **rien n'écrivait nulle part**. Chaque redémarrage
  jetait 100 % de ce que le flux avait mis des heures à enseigner : un
  changement de config Vite, un déploiement, un capot rabattu. Mesuré sur le
  flux réel le 2026-09-03, boîte mondiale, 5 minutes : **18 308 MMSI distincts
  ont émis une position, 5 530 ont émis un message statique**. Ces ~70 % sont la
  taille du seau « Type non déclaré » à un instant donné — et sans rien sur
  disque, chaque session repartait de 100 % pour y redescendre.
  Les identités apprises tiennent maintenant dans
  `.gev-cache/ais-static/registry.json`, **30 jours** — le TTL et le
  raisonnement du cache des installations militaires : un MMSI change de type à
  l'échelle du chantier naval, pas de la session. Écriture atomique (fichier
  temporaire puis `rename`, pour qu'un disque plein ne déchire pas des semaines
  d'apprentissage), une réécriture par minute au plus, et un vidage
  **synchrone** à l'extinction — la minute de retard n'est perdue que sur un
  `kill -9`. Le fichier est lu une fois au démarrage et **le flux en cours gagne
  toujours** une collision ; le disque ne fait que combler ses trous, ce dont a
  précisément besoin un `StaticDataReport` scindé en deux moitiés dont l'une
  porte le nom et l'autre la coque.
  **La destination n'y entre pas.** Elle voyage dans le même message 5 que
  l'identité, mais c'est une donnée de *voyage* : vraie pour une traversée,
  fausse pour la suivante. Rejouer une destination de trois semaines sur une
  fiche vivante serait un mensonge dit avec aplomb ; le champ est retiré à la
  porte et n'est jamais restauré.
  Et la fuite, réelle et indépendante du reste : `pruneAisStreamCache()`
  élaguait les positions et les traces, jamais ce registre — qui grossissait
  donc pour la vie du processus. Il a maintenant son propre balayage, borné par
  le TTL de 30 jours et par un plafond de 50 000 identités (la plus anciennement
  entendue part la première), au plus une fois par minute puisqu'un TTL de
  30 jours ne peut rien périmer entre deux messages de position.
  Politique et forme du fichier sont pures et testées hors ligne dans
  `src/data/aisStaticRegistry.js` ; `vite.config.js` ne garde que le chemin, la
  temporisation et le `rename`. `npm run qa:vessel-types` mesure le serveur qui
  tourne : contacts dans la boîte souscrite, taille du registre, part des
  contacts vivants déjà sur disque — c'est-à-dire ce que le prochain démarrage
  gardera —, part de types déclarés, absence de destination sur disque et
  bornes du registre. Vérifié sur de vrais redémarrages successifs — **159,
  puis 442, puis 1 568 identités écrites puis relues à l'identique** —, et le
  premier contact servi après un démarrage portait déjà son type et sa coque.
  Sur la dernière session, 3 252 contacts vivants : **1 463 d'entre eux
  (45,0 %) étaient déjà sur disque**, c'est-à-dire ce que le démarrage suivant
  n'aura pas à réapprendre. Avant, ce nombre était zéro à chaque fois.

- **Le seuil de fraîcheur des vols suit le TTL, au lieu de le contredire.**
  Le rapport terrain était « ce data layer tombe très rapidement en mode
  fallback ». Il n'y avait aucune panne derrière. Il y avait **deux constantes
  de 120 s écrites séparément** — l'une au proxy, décidant quand abandonner
  OpenSky pour le cercle régional de 250 NM d'adsb.lol, l'autre au navigateur,
  décidant quand allumer le badge orange STALE — et, entre les deux, un
  gouverneur de crédit qui étire le cache à **300 s** à mesure que le budget
  quotidien OpenSky s'épuise. Un corps servi depuis un cache de 300 s a
  mécaniquement plus de 120 s. Passé le premier palier, ces seuils ne
  *mesuraient* pas la péremption : ils la *garantissaient*.
  Un seul endroit décide maintenant, `src/data/openSkyFreshness.js`, lu par le
  proxy **et** par le navigateur : périmé ⟺ plus vieux que **le TTL que le
  gouverneur a lui-même choisi**, plus une tolérance fixe de 120 s pour l'âge
  que l'instantané avait déjà en amont. Cacher 300 s délibérément et servir un
  corps de 300 s n'est pas une surprise ; 420 s en est une. Le TTL étant borné
  à 300 s, le seuil est borné à 420 s — ce n'est jamais un permis de servir des
  positions anciennes. Le proxy publie le TTL appliqué sur
  `X-OpenSky-Ttl-Seconds`, pour que le client juge le même nombre plutôt qu'une
  seconde copie.
  Mesuré le 2026-09-03 par `npm run qa:flight-freshness`, sur une fenêtre de
  cache complète, clé anonyme, TTL 300 s : **6 sondages sur 13 dépassaient
  120 s** — exactement les polls qui affichaient FALLBACK — et **aucun** ne
  dépasse le nouveau seuil.
  **Et adsb.lol cesse d'être présenté comme une panne.** Deux choses lui
  collaient une pastille orange. La première était une regex : `manager.js`
  déduisait « repli » en cherchant `adsb.lol` dans le *nom* de la source — au
  point que la couche militaire, dont adsb.lol est la source *primaire*, devait
  publier `fallback: false` pour démentir la devinette. La seconde était un mot
  dans la prose : l'en-tête de couverture disait « 250nm regional **fallback** »,
  que la même fonction relisait avec `/\bfallback\b/i`. Un nom de source n'est
  pas un verdict de flux, et un mot glissé dans une phrase encore moins.
  Or adsb.lol n'est pas une dégradation : il est **plus frais** que l'instantané
  OpenSky qu'il remplace et porte le **désignateur ICAO en clair**, qu'OpenSky
  n'a tout simplement pas. Ce qui change quand il sert, ce n'est pas la
  qualité, c'est l'**étendue** — un cercle de 250 NM autour du point visé au
  lieu d'un instantané mondial. C'est donc l'étendue, et rien d'autre, que la
  réponse annonce désormais : un **rayon en nombre**, que la couche met en
  phrase elle-même (« cercle régional de 250 NM », en face de « couverture
  mondiale »). Une phrase destinée à l'écran n'a rien à faire dans un en-tête
  HTTP, dont les valeurs sont en ISO-8859-1 : le premier accent hors de cette
  table s'y perdrait en silence.
  La couche civile publie le booléen elle-même, à `false`, comme la militaire :
  aucune de ses deux sources n'est un repli, et le jour où un vrai chemin
  dégradé existera, c'est ce champ qui basculera — pas un mot passé en fraude
  dans un libellé. La pastille reste **ON**, et la ligne sous le nom de la
  couche dit laquelle des deux sources parle et jusqu'où elle porte :
  `adsb.lol · cercle régional de 250 NM · flux · à l'instant`.
  **Et la fiche Contexte nomme la même source que la pastille.** Elle écrivait
  `OpenSky Network` en dur — donc, pendant tout le temps où le cercle régional
  servait, deux surfaces distantes de deux centimètres nommaient deux sources
  différentes, et celle qui parlait n'était pas la bonne.
  **Reste la cause racine, qui n'est pas du code** : `OPENSKY_CLIENT_ID` et
  `OPENSKY_CLIENT_SECRET` sont présents mais **vides** dans le `.env` racine,
  donc `OPENSKY_AUTH_MODE=oauth` retombe en anonyme
  (`X-OpenSky-Auth-Reason: oauth_invalid_or_missing`), donc le gouverneur passe
  au palier 300 s. Avec des identifiants OAuth, le TTL reste à 9 s et rien de
  tout ceci ne se déclenche. Voir `docs/opensky-auth.md`.
- **Le flux régional suit le contact suivi, plus la caméra.** Les paramètres
  `lat`/`lon` de `/api/opensky` ancrent le cercle de 250 NM d'adsb.lol — la
  couverture de repli, c'est-à-dire l'essentiel du temps sur une clé anonyme.
  Ils étaient pris sur le **point sous la caméra**, ce qui supposait la caméra
  toujours au-dessus de son sujet. Elle ne l'est pas : le cadrage de route la
  poste sur le flanc de la liaison, à 758 NM de l'avion pour un cadrage à
  5 200 km, et une simple orbite large fait la même chose en plus petit.
  L'avion suivi sortait alors de son propre flux, était évincé au sondage
  suivant et se désélectionnait tout seul — mesuré le 2026-09-03 sur EZY61NZ,
  dont la vue de route effaçait son propre sujet un sondage après l'avoir
  cadré. L'ancre est maintenant la position du contact suivi quand il y en a
  un, le point sous la caméra sinon.
- **Le nom d'un avion, et celui d'un aéroport, sont des surfaces cliquables.**
  L'étiquette DETECT d'un vol est peinte par le calque de détection sur un
  canevas `pointer-events: none` : elle n'existait pour le clic à aucun titre.
  Viser la callsign — plusieurs fois l'aire du sprite, qui fait quelques pixels
  d'une cible à 900 km/h — revenait donc à cliquer le globe, c'est-à-dire à
  **désélectionner l'avion qu'on voulait suivre**. Le calque publie désormais,
  à chaque frame peinte, le rectangle exact des mots qu'il vient de tracer, sous
  une portée par couche (`detect:flights`, `detect:military`) — sans quoi un
  clic sur un vol civil se résoudrait dans la couche militaire. Les
  gestionnaires de clic des **Vols** et des **Vols militaires** consultent ce
  plan **après** `scene.pick`, jamais avant : un contact sous le curseur garde
  son propre clic, et une callsign trop pâle pour être lue ne publie rien du
  tout. Le même correctif ouvre les **noms d'aéroports** — et ceux des ports,
  barrages et datacenters : le nom sur le globe sélectionne et cadre exactement
  comme la pastille au bout de la tige, alors qu'il était inerte. Cette couche
  cède le pas au marqueur d'une couche voisine, mais **pas** à une tuile 3D
  photoréaliste — sur un globe texturé, presque chaque pixel « pique » une
  tuile que personne ne possède et que personne ne peut sélectionner, et la
  traiter comme occupée aurait laissé tous les noms inertes.
- **Les avions cessent de porter la silhouette d'un autre.** La source de repli
  du calque civil, adsb.lol, publie le désignateur de type OACI (`t`) et
  l'immatriculation (`r`) sur chaque contact ; l'adaptateur
  `adsbLolFallback.js` ne recopiait ni l'un ni l'autre. Il ne transmettait que
  la catégorie d'émetteur — un canal grossier qui range un jet d'affaires parmi
  les monocouloirs et un turbopropulseur parmi les avions légers. Mesuré le
  2026-09-03 sur l'amont réel, Paris et Los Angeles, 1 452 contacts : **95,7 %
  portent un désignateur de type**, et le lire **reclasse 19,7 % de la flotte**
  — dont **244 contacts qui n'étaient pas « non classés » mais classés faux**
  (96 jets d'affaires dessinés en monocouloirs, 39 turbopropulseurs dessinés en
  avions légers). Le vecteur d'état gagne deux entrées après les 18 d'OpenSky,
  que le client lit déjà par indice. Une réponse `adsbdb` déjà obtenue reste
  prioritaire : elle seule porte aussi le nom lisible que les fiches impriment.
  Sur le chemin OpenSky, rien ne change et rien ne pouvait changer —
  `/states/all` ne transporte aucun code type, et sa catégorie d'émetteur reste
  vide pour **94,6 %** des contacts, mesuré le même jour sur 12 869 états.
- **L'immatriculation cesse de se faire passer pour un indicatif.** Faute
  d'indicatif, l'adaptateur logeait `r` dans la case indicatif du vecteur, si
  bien que `mapAnalystRecord` publiait une immatriculation comme un indicatif
  prononcé. Elle voyage maintenant dans sa propre case, et la chaîne
  indicatif → immatriculation → hexadécimal fait la substitution un étage plus
  haut, là où elle sait quel champ elle lit. Sur l'amont réel : 17 contacts
  concernés, désormais 0.
- **La carte ne se reconstruit plus deux fois par chargement.** `#map=ign-plan`
  activait OSM au démarrage, puis rejouait le vrai fond une seconde et demie
  plus tard — et `_activateGlobeStack()` **détruit et reconstruit** chaque
  `Cesium.ImageryLayer`, donc le lecteur voyait un fond apparaître, disparaître,
  puis un second se raffiner du grossier au net depuis un cache de tuiles vide.
  Mesuré avant : trois couches d'imagerie construites par chargement, OSM à
  500 ms puis Plan IGN à 1 500 ms. Après : **deux, dès la première frame**, et
  le fond demandé du premier coup. Le hash est lu avant l'activation, et
  `setStack()` sur le fond déjà vivant ne reconstruit plus rien.
- **Le flou ne s'installe plus pour la session.** Le gouverneur de détail double
  la tolérance d'erreur du globe sur `moveStart` et la rend sur `moveEnd` ; un
  vol annulé en plein air — ce que fait `camera.cancelFlight()`, appelé par la
  restauration de lien — laissait le globe **épinglé au double jusqu'au
  rechargement**. C'est le « on passe à une version moins nette » qui ne revient
  pas. Un filet de sécurité rend la valeur réglée dès que la pose de la caméra
  n'a pas bougé d'un intervalle entier : pas un simple délai, qui couperait le
  vol d'introduction de quatre secondes ou une orbite de plusieurs minutes.
- **Une couche allumée ne dégrade plus le seuil de rafraîchissement de toutes
  les autres.** `camera.percentageChanged` est **un seul nombre** partagé par
  tous les écouteurs `camera.changed` ; onze couches le descendaient à 0,05 à
  l'activation et leur `disable()` ne le rendait jamais. Mesuré avant : 0,5 →
  Transports en commun allumé 0,05 → **éteint, toujours 0,05**, pour le reste de
  la session. C'était la sensation de rechargement permanent. Les douze
  demandeurs passent par un module à compteur de références
  (`src/data/cameraSensitivity.js`, calqué sur les prises du gouverneur de
  rendu) : la valeur appliquée est le minimum des demandes vivantes, et celle
  d'origine revient quand la dernière est relâchée. La sauvegarde manuelle de
  `traffic.js` disparaît — elle était encore fausse à deux couches, la seconde
  sauvegardant la valeur que la première avait déjà baissée.
- **Un fond de carte qui n'est pas celui demandé le dit.** Un échec Google
  Photorealistic 3D Tiles au démarrage se repliait en silence sur OSM : le fond
  n'était donc pas déterministe d'un rechargement à l'autre. La puce de source
  de carte porte désormais l'avertissement et la phrase du fournisseur —
  « HTTP 403 — Your request cannot be served because satellite tiles and 3D
  tiles are not available for your account and region » — réduite à une ligne
  lisible depuis le `RequestErrorEvent` de Cesium, qui n'a pas de `message` et se
  sérialisait en neuf cents caractères d'en-têtes gzip.
- Nouveau harnais : `npm run qa:map-reload` vérifie les quatre nombres sur une
  page réelle — constructions d'imagerie par chargement, tolérance d'erreur
  après un vol annulé, `percentageChanged` après extinction d'une couche, et le
  fond dégradé nommé sur la puce.
- **Les bouées ne traversent plus le globe.** Rien n'y était animé : les
  positions viennent d'un seul `Cartesian3.fromDegrees` par relevé, le parseur
  est positionnellement juste, aucune propriété n'est une callback. La dérive
  était une **asymétrie** entre les trois marques d'une même station. La
  pastille ignorait le test de profondeur *et* n'était écrêtée nulle part — une
  bouée du Pacifique se peignait donc à travers la planète — pendant que sa
  propre tige, elle, était masquée par le limbe, et que sa fiche l'était déjà
  par l'hôte de surcouche. Une pastille sans tige et sans fiche, glissant sur le
  disque du globe quand la caméra tourne : c'était ça, la « dérive ». La
  pastille garde `disableDepthTestDistance` — c'est la convention arrêtée deux
  fois dans ce dépôt, chez les vols et chez les navires, parce qu'une distance
  finie ferait clignoter les contacts sur le maillage photoréaliste et ne
  servirait à rien quand les tuiles 3D Google possèdent la planète. C'est le
  **découpage** qui manquait : l'occulteur ellipsoïdal partagé retire la face
  cachée, et le cadre de la caméra retire le reste. Les 879 stations du relevé
  du 2026-09-03 tombent à 816 vues de l'Atlantique nord à 14 000 km, et à 199
  au-dessus du golfe du Mexique. Mesuré : la plus lointaine dessinée à 71,47°,
  l'horizon à 71,78°, la plus proche masquée à 72,12° — l'écrêtage tombe **sur**
  le limbe.
- **Une bouée et un navire flottent enfin sur la même mer.** `heightReference:
  NONE` posait chaque station à la hauteur ellipsoïdale zéro, alors que
  l'ondulation du géoïde EGM96 va de −106 à +85 m et que le calque AIS y ancre
  déjà ses coques. Les pastilles et leurs tiges se posent sur le géoïde ; une
  grille qui ne charge pas coûte le **repère**, jamais le calque.
- Nouveau harnais : `npm run qa:marine-buoys` compte, il ne regarde pas. Face
  cachée depuis l'Atlantique nord puis depuis l'antipode, écrêtage au limbe à
  la fraction de degré, stations hors cadre, accord entre le nombre publié et
  le nombre dessiné, et la hauteur des stations dans la plage EGM96 — 8/8 sur
  page réelle.

## [Unreleased] — 2026-09-02

### Added
- **Le carroyage peut enfin être servi au millésime 2021, pas seulement 2019.**
  L'INSEE a publié le carroyage 2021 le **12 février 2026** ; la Géoplateforme
  relaie toujours 2019 — mesuré au nombre de carreaux : 2 314 836 servis, contre
  2 313 783 documentés pour 2019 et 2 324 577 pour 2021.
  `npm run filosofi:pack-2021` transforme le CSV de l'INSEE en shards gzippés
  dans `.gev-cache/`, et le proxy les préfère quand ils sont là.
- **Le pack est OPTIONNEL et son absence n'est pas une erreur.** Un clone neuf
  n'a pas de pack, dessine 2019, et **dit** 2019 : le millésime voyage avec
  chaque réponse au lieu d'être une constante que le client suppose. C'est la
  propriété que tout ce chemin existe pour protéger — un calque qui code son
  propre millésime en dur est à un rafraîchissement amont de légender des
  chiffres 2021 avec « 2019 ».
- **Le parquet de 95 Mo sur data.gouv était la voie économique, et il est
  inutilisable** : 34 colonnes, et pas l'indicatrice d'imputation. Ce calque
  dessine un carreau modélisé en anneau parce que 39 % le sont ; une source qui
  ne sait pas dire lesquels ne peut pas l'alimenter. Le CSV de l'INSEE porte
  `i_est_200`, `i_est_1km` **et** `lcog_geo`.
- **Une découpe CSV naïve corrompait une ligne sur douze.** Environ **8 % des
  lignes citent leur champ commune** parce que le carreau est à cheval —
  `"2A041,2A247"` — et `split(',')` décale toutes les colonnes suivantes. Le
  premier build a publié une France à **64 010 communes** ; avec une découpe qui
  respecte les guillemets, **34 851**, ce qui est le bon nombre.
- **Le maillage 1 km est agrégé localement, à partir du fichier 200 m déjà
  ouvert.** Les ratios sont recalculés sur des numérateurs et dénominateurs
  **sommés, jamais moyennés** : la moyenne des taux de pauvreté de deux carreaux
  n'est pas le taux de pauvreté des deux.

### Fixed
- **Le HUD ne disparaît plus quand le sol est clair.** Les lectures du HUD
  étaient peintes à même le canevas du globe, dont la luminance couvre toute
  l'étendue — mer sombre jusqu'aux toits blancs — sans aucune plaque derrière
  elles : mesuré le 2026-09-03, masque de portée désactivé, `#hud-summary`
  au-dessus du centre de Paris se posait sur `rgb(227,231,228)` pour un rapport
  de contraste de **1,00** contre son propre cyan. La ligne qui répond à « où
  suis-je » était exactement de la couleur du sol qu'elle décrit. Le masque de
  portée cachait le problème parce qu'il assombrit les bords du cadre, mais
  c'est une coïncidence et non une garantie : le masque est une bascule
  utilisateur. Les quatre coins portent maintenant un voile sombre flouté —
  ramené à **5,31** dans le même relevé, au-dessus du seuil AA. La variante
  `operator`, qui avait déjà une plaque à 0,36 d'alpha, est alignée dessus :
  elle était trop mince pour porter le texte sur un toit blanc.
- **La bascule ON/OFF de chaque calque montre enfin qu'elle a le focus.**
  `.data-toggle-btn` déclarait `outline: none` — délibéré, l'anneau du
  navigateur est carré et jure avec le rayon de 4 px — mais rien ne l'avait
  remplacé : le contrôle le plus utilisé du produit était atteignable au clavier
  et invisible une fois atteint, au bout de neuf tabulations. L'anneau est
  désormais dessiné en `box-shadow`, donc il suit le rayon, et doublé d'un liseré
  sombre pour survivre au fond du bouton.
- **Un clic sur une bascule de calque s'accuse immédiatement.** L'état pressé
  n'existait nulle part sur le rail : trois sélecteurs `:active` dans toute la
  feuille contre soixante-douze `:hover`. Sur un flux lent, le clic ne recevait
  aucune réponse avant la fin du chargement, des secondes plus tard.
- **Un flux en cours de chargement ne se déguise plus en flux nominal.**
  `feed-loading` portait une largeur et un interlettrage, et aucune couleur : un
  calque actif encore en train de charger retombait sur `.data-toggle-btn.active`
  et prenait le cyan exact d'un flux sain. Cinq états de flux, quatre couleurs —
  celui qui veut dire « pas encore là » portait celui qui veut dire « bon ». Il
  prend une ardoise neutre, qui ne rejoint pas la rampe d'alerte (ambre périmé,
  orange dégradé, rouge indisponible).
- **Le document se déclare en français.** `<html lang="en">` couronnait une
  interface dont le texte visible est français à dix contre un — 68 nœuds de
  texte français contre 7 anglais, relevés à l'écran panneaux ouverts. Un
  lecteur d'écran lisait donc « Bouées marines » et « État du réseau routier »
  avec une voix anglaise (WCAG 3.1.1). La racine passe à `fr` et les six
  en-têtes de panneau, qui sont systématiquement anglais, sont marqués
  `lang="en"`. Le reste de la chrome anglaise n'est pas encore marqué.
- **La Martinique et La Réunion se dessinent enfin — elles n'avaient JAMAIS été
  dessinées.** Le calque déclarait les couvrir depuis sa mise en service et n'a
  jamais tracé un seul de leurs carreaux : l'INSEE maille chaque territoire dans
  sa propre zone — métropole en EPSG:3035, Martinique en 5490 (UTM 20 N), La
  Réunion en 2975 (UTM 40 S) — et le lecteur d'identifiant n'acceptait que
  `CRS3035`. Chaque cellule était jetée sans un mot. Mesuré le 2026-09-03 sur
  Saint-Denis : le service répond `numberMatched: 2 502` et le calque en
  dessinait **0**.
- **L'application porte désormais l'inverse des deux zones UTM**, à côté de
  celui du LAEA et pour la même raison : trois formules fermées ne justifient
  pas une dépendance de projection. Vérifié contre la géométrie que le service
  envoie réellement — **0,78 mm d'écart maximal sur La Réunion, 0,50 mm sur la
  Martinique**, sous le 1e-8° que le module promet. Le maillage fait partie de
  l'identité d'une cellule : deux carreaux de deux territoires peuvent porter
  les mêmes coordonnées et désigner des lieux différents.

- **Le carroyage INSEE se regarde enfin depuis la France entière.** Le calque
  refusait toute vue plus large que 0,9° — à raison : 2,3 millions de carreaux
  ramenés à une page de 5 000, c'est une image de l'échantillon, pas du pays.
  Mais ça laissait la carte vide exactement à l'altitude où l'application
  s'ouvre. Au-dessus du plafond de la grille, le calque **change de jeu de
  données** au lieu de s'éteindre : un disque par **région**, puis un par
  **département**, sur les agrégats que l'INSEE publie déjà.
- **Quatre régimes sur une seule ligne de calque** : régions au-delà de 12°,
  départements jusqu'au plafond de la grille, puis carreaux de 1 km et de
  200 m. Même grammaire à tous les niveaux — l'aire est la population, la
  couleur est l'indicateur, six paliers mesurés sur chacun — parce que traverser
  un seuil de zoom change la RÉSOLUTION, pas le sujet.
- **Six indicateurs au niveau territorial, dont deux que le carreau ne peut pas
  calculer** : niveau de vie médian, taux de pauvreté, population, **écart
  D9/D1**, **indice de Gini**, et le **salaire net privé 2024** — la seule
  donnée de revenu que l'INSEE publie pour 2024 avec une géographie. Le salaire
  n'est pas un niveau de vie et l'infobulle le dit : c'est avant impôts et
  prestations, par emploi et non par ménage, fonction publique exclue.
- **C'est un AUTRE jeu de données, pas le même vu de plus loin, et chaque fiche
  le dit.** Une médiane là où la grille a une moyenne, des personnes là où elle
  compte des ménages, 2023 là où le relais est en 2019. Trois éditeurs, trois
  millésimes, et chaque ligne de fiche porte l'année de son chiffre.
- **Les paliers de couleur territoriaux sont mesurés, pas empruntés.** La rampe
  du carroyage va de 15 300 à 32 400 € ; tous les départements de France tiennent
  dans une fenêtre de 10 000 €. La lui emprunter aurait peint le pays en deux
  bandes. `build-filosofi-territoires.mjs` mesure les quantiles pondérés sur
  **les 97 territoires — 67 055 494 habitants** : ce n'est pas un échantillon,
  il n'y en a que 97.
- **Le repère des Hauts-de-Seine n'est pas dans Paris.** Le 92 est un croissant
  autour du 75, donc son centroïde de surface tombe dans Paris : les deux disques
  se seraient superposés. Le constructeur du pack vérifie les 97 et déplace ceux
  qui tombent hors de leur propre contour vers le point intérieur le plus éloigné
  du bord. Un seul en avait besoin, et c'était celui-là.
- **Le calque ne déplace plus la caméra.** Il volait l'opérateur jusqu'à une
  ville quand on l'allumait depuis une vue nationale, parce qu'une vue large ne
  dessinait rien. Elle dessine maintenant les départements du pays : bouger la
  caméra reviendrait à résoudre un problème qui n'existe plus, en prenant une
  décision à la place de l'opérateur.
- **Pouls vélo — la carte réapparaît sous la nappe, et le panneau se déplace.**
  Quatre corrections tirées de la doctrine cartographique du dépôt, mesurées
  plutôt qu'estimées. **L'opacité portait la valeur une deuxième fois** (0,50 →
  0,90 selon l'intensité, par-dessus une couleur qui disait déjà la même chose) :
  au sommet de la rampe il ne restait **10 % du fond de carte** sous une tache,
  donc le calque effaçait la ville précisément là où il avait quelque chose à en
  dire. Alpha fixe à 0,45, le fond garde 55 % de lui-même partout.
- **La rampe montait puis redescendait.** Mesurées en clarté CIE L\*, les cinq
  bandes donnaient 27 · 50 · 67 · 80 · **58** : la bande la plus chargée était
  plus sombre que celle d'en dessous, donc l'ordre mourait dès qu'on retirait la
  teinte — daltonisme, niveaux de gris, écran délavé. Et aucun réglage d'opacité
  ne le rattrapait, le défaut était dans la rampe.
- **Et la première réparation en a créé une autre.** Faire monter la rampe
  jusqu'au bout — jusqu'à une menthe pâle — remettait l'ordre et rendait le
  calque invisible : mesurée contre la carte qu'elle recouvre, la bande la plus
  chargée tombait à ΔE 11 sur une ville claire, soit une tache que personne ne
  voit. Une rampe doit passer **deux** épreuves, et une seule est dans la
  doctrine. La rampe descend donc, et elle descend vers le chaud : blanc bleuté
  → ambre → orange → rouge → carmin, **93 · 80 · 63 · 45 · 27**. Les bandes
  restent à 6,3 L\* l'une de l'autre sur six fonds d'essai, la bande « ≥ 80 % »
  ressort à **ΔE 24** de la carte, et la bande « < 20 % » n'en ressort
  volontairement presque pas : une station qui ne fait rien laisse voir sa rue,
  ce qui est exactement la demande. Aucun vert, donc aucune lecture « feu
  tricolore » ; ΔE 19 des deux autres rampes de magnitude dessinées sur les
  mêmes rues. Un test recalcule toute la chaîne — y compris l'alpha lu dans le
  calque lui-même — et échoue à la première inversion, à la première bande qui
  cesse de se détacher, et à la première bande chargée qui cesse de se voir.
- **Une heure non relevée passe de 22 % à 32 % d'opacité.** Contre la bande
  pâle de la nouvelle rampe — une station mesurée et presque inerte — le gris à
  22 % tombait à ΔE 12 sur une ville claire : assez proche pour être confondu.
  Un trou et un zéro sont deux affirmations différentes.
- **Une tache ne grossit plus avec la distance.** Sa surface EST la quantité ;
  la multiplier par un facteur qui dépend de la caméra faisait dessiner deux
  stations identiques à des tailles différentes dans une même image oblique — la
  lointaine jusqu'à 4,5 fois la proche — pendant que le panneau affirmait « la
  surface, c'est la quantité mesurée ». Ce qui remplace ce facteur n'est pas une
  correction de taille mais l'aveu de la portée : le champ s'efface entre 40 et
  90 km, et au-dessus le panneau dit « descendez sous 90 km » au lieu de gonfler
  ses marques.
- **Le panneau dit ce qu'il dessine** : *une tache par station*. Ce n'est pas une
  carte de chaleur par noyau — celle-ci agrège ses points et rendrait la fiche
  mensongère, puisqu'il n'y aurait plus une station sous le curseur.
- **Trois défauts trouvés par une revue adverse, et corrigés.** Le fondu de
  distance de Cesium n'est pas linéaire — `czm_nearFarScalar` travaille sur des
  distances au CARRÉ et élève le résultat à la puissance 0,2 — donc un champ
  annoncé « 40 → 90 km » est déjà à 42 % d'opacité à 45 km et à 13 % à 70 :
  l'avertissement se déclenche désormais à 45 km, là où la carte se vide
  vraiment. Il écoute aussi `moveEnd` en plus de `changed`, sinon un zoom
  ordinaire franchit le plafond sans rien dire. Et une heure non relevée est
  maintenant DESSINÉE — un point gris au rayon plancher — au lieu d'un rayon
  nul : un site qui disparaît ne se distingue pas d'un site qui n'existe pas,
  alors que la ligne du calque les compte sous « non relevé ».
- **Et deux dans le déplacement lui-même.** Les gestionnaires de glissé étaient
  partagés par toutes les prises au lieu d'une par glissé : deux doigts sur un
  écran tactile, ou une reprise après un `pointerup` avalé par un changement de
  fenêtre, et la première prise abandonnait ses écouteurs sur `window` sans que
  rien puisse les retirer — le panneau suivait la souris sans bouton enfoncé et
  le clic suivant enregistrait la position (0, 0) d'un nœud détaché. Un clic
  droit sur la bande de la semaine, enfin, lançait un scrub que rien ne
  terminait, le menu contextuel avalant le relâchement. Les deux ont leur test
  de régression, vérifié par mutation.

- **Et il se déplace.** Cliquer-glisser n'importe où sur le panneau le déplace,
  sauf sur la bande de la semaine et les boutons, qui restent des commandes ; il
  est bloqué à six pixels des bords pour qu'on puisse toujours le rattraper,
  retrouve sa place à la session suivante, et un double-clic sur son en-tête le
  ramène à son ancrage. La géométrie sort dans `src/panelDrag.js`, que `ui.js`
  utilise désormais aussi : une seule définition de la marge et de la clé de
  stockage pour tous les panneaux, y compris ceux qu'`ui.js` ne voit jamais
  parce qu'ils s'installent eux-mêmes.
- **La zone de chalandise se dessine autour du point que vous choisissez.**
  Jusqu'ici le centre était l'endroit que la caméra regardait — correct pour lire
  une rue, inutile pour la seule question que ce calque pose : « qu'est-ce que
  CETTE porte atteint ». Un clic sur la carte fixe désormais le centre. La
  caméra ne le déplace plus, une puce **LIBÉRER** le rend au suivi automatique,
  et le repère central dit lequel des deux états il est dans.
- **Et fixer un point supprime le plafond d'altitude, ce qui est le seul moyen
  de voir une zone de chalandise en voiture en entier.** Mesuré le 2026-09-02
  sur cinq communes, à quinze minutes : une zone à pied fait au plus 1,8 × 1,9 km,
  à vélo 4,1 × 7,2 km, en voiture **16,5 × 14,1 km** (Cantal rural). Cesium
  montre environ 0,65 × l'altitude de sol sur le petit axe de l'écran au nadir :
  avec un plafond unique à 8 km, le calque effaçait la zone qu'il venait de
  mesurer au moment précis où on reculait pour la regarder. Les plafonds suivent
  maintenant le mode — **8 / 20 / 45 km** — avec des seuils de déplacement de
  0,25 / 0,6 / 1,5 km assortis ; et un centre fixé n'a plus de plafond du tout,
  parce qu'un point fixe ne déclenche aucune requête quand la caméra bouge.
- **Le vélo fonctionne, et il annonce qu'il n'est pas de la même nature.** L'IGN
  ne publie aucun profil vélo, sur aucune ressource — resondé le 2026-09-02,
  `bicycle`, `bike`, `cycle` et `cycling` répondent tous HTTP 400 sur
  `bdtopo-valhalla` **et** sur `bdtopo-pgr`. La BD TOPO n'a pas de modèle de coût
  cyclable : il n'y a rien à lui demander. L'anneau vélo est donc mesuré sur le
  réseau cyclable OpenStreetMap via la table OSRM de FOSSGIS — **36 rayons de 11
  échantillons**, une seule requête pour les trois anneaux, et la portée de
  chaque rayon est l'endroit où la durée mesurée croise le budget.
- **C'est une ENVELOPPE, et rien ne laisse croire le contraire.** Le trait entre
  deux rayons voisins n'est mesuré par personne : une étoile ne sait pas dire une
  poche inatteignable ni une zone en morceaux, elle les remplit. Sa surface est
  donc un **majorant** — contour en tirets, « km² au plus », jamais « réellement
  atteignables », et le nombre de rayons, l'écart des portées et le nom du réseau
  sur chaque fiche. L'écart est mesuré, pas affirmé : la même méthode appliquée
  au réseau piéton et comparée au polygone IGN au même point donne **+1 / +17 /
  +19 %** à Lyon, **+14 / +11 / +14 %** à Paris 11e, **−24 / +2 / +9 %** à
  Bordeaux, **−32 / −12 / +40 %** à Ustaritz et **+117 / +69 / +69 %** dans le
  Cantal rural. C'est le pire cas honnête, et c'est pour lui que l'étiquette
  existe : là où le réseau tient en trois routes, la vraie forme est une araignée
  et toute enveloppe autour d'une araignée est surtout du sol inaccessible.
  Ajouter des rayons n'y change rien — à 24, 32, 48 et 64 directions le chiffre
  lyonnais reste à un point de +19 % : l'erreur est la FORME, pas la résolution.
- **Pouls vélo — une carte de chaleur, et une semaine qu'on peut enfin lire.**
  Le calque dessinait 561 cubes extrudés : la couleur pour la part du maximum, la
  HAUTEUR pour la quantité. À l'écran c'est un champ de confettis flottants — l'un
  cache l'autre, au nadir le canal hauteur disparaît entièrement, et d'assez loin
  pour voir la forme d'une ville il ne reste rien. C'est maintenant une nappe de
  chaleur : une tache douce par site, posée au sol, dimensionnée EN MÈTRES, qui
  déborde sur ses voisines comme le fait une carte de densité. La couleur reste la
  part du maximum hebdomadaire du site lui-même, interpolée entre les cinq bandes
  de la légende au lieu de sauter de l'une à l'autre ; ce qui était dans la hauteur
  est passé dans la SURFACE — deux fois la quantité, deux fois l'encre, ce qui est
  ce qu'un lecteur lit d'un disque.
- **L'animation dit ce qu'elle montre.** SEMAINE déroulait 168 heures en 37
  secondes sans une seule indication : pas d'heure à l'écran, pas de forme de la
  semaine, aucun moyen de s'arrêter sur une heure. Un panneau sous le globe porte
  désormais l'heure en toutes lettres, ce que fait le réseau à cette heure-là
  (« pointe », « la nuit — presque personne ne roule »), la semaine entière en 168
  barres — la courbe même sur laquelle POINTE se fige — et un curseur sur l'heure
  dessinée.
- **Cette bande EST la commande.** Un clic, un glissé ou les flèches du clavier
  posent la semaine sur l'heure demandée et la mettent en pause ; le bouton la
  relance exactement là. Le rythme passe de 220 ms à 520 ms par heure — la semaine
  complète en 87 s au lieu de 37 — et chaque tache glisse ENTRE les heures au lieu
  de sauter : la valeur affichée est l'heure où l'on est, adoucie vers la suivante,
  et un trou dans l'archive n'est jamais comblé par son voisin.
- **La fiche d'une station ne peut plus se cacher.** La carte d'un site cliqué est
  ancrée dans le monde : hors du hublot elle tombe à 1 % d'opacité, autant dire
  rien — un lecteur qui clique près du bord du scope n'obtenait aucune réponse. La
  fiche est désormais aussi dans le panneau, toujours à l'écran : le nom, la
  lecture de l'heure dans l'unité de la ville, le maximum de la semaine, et la
  semaine propre de la station en 168 barres aux couleurs de la carte. Les deux
  sortent de la même fonction, donc elles ne peuvent pas imprimer deux nombres
  différents pour un même quai.
- **Le bruit des aéroports se lit enfin de loin.** Le calque tirait UNE bande sur
  les quatre d'un plan et s'effaçait au-dessus de 12 km — alors que le plan le
  plus large de France, la zone D du Bourget, fait 65,8 km de côté : la forme ne
  pouvait être entière à l'écran à aucune altitude où le calque répondait. Un
  PEB est un jeu d'anneaux emboîtés, le point de référence de l'aérodrome est
  dans la zone A, et B, C et D sont des couronnes qui ne le contiennent pas. Le
  service ne renvoie que ce qui touche le pixel demandé, donc à l'échelle fine
  il ne renvoyait que le cœur.
- **Au-dessus de 12 km, le calque change de question.** Il ne demande plus « dans
  quelle zone est ce point » mais « quels plans couvrent ce cadre » : une sonde
  par AÉRODROME en vue, sur son propre point publié, à une échelle dont le tampon
  ramène le plan complet. Mesuré sur 25 aérodromes du registre : 37 bandes à
  l'échelle fine, **88 à l'échelle d'ensemble**. Roissy sort ses quatre zones
  d'un coup, et Toussus, Pontoise et Coulommiers — qui ne répondaient à aucune
  échelle fine — répondent. Jusqu'à 24 aérodromes à la fois, ce qui couvre tout
  le bassin parisien ; ce qui dépasse est compté et annoncé, jamais coupé en
  silence.
- **L'intérieur d'une zone répond au clic, plus seulement son contour.** Le
  lavis est un polygone, un polygone n'a pas de position, et l'index de cartes de
  la coque se construit sur des positions : tout pixel à l'intérieur d'une bande
  était inerte. Mesuré à 60 km sur Roissy, un clic sur le repère de l'aérodrome
  lui-même renvoyait le lavis en dessous. Le clic répond désormais pour le sol
  visé — bande, seuils, arrêté — retesté point-dans-polygone contre les
  découpes, et il dit qu'il a été lu sur un contour généralisé.
- **Autorisations d'urbanisme — what has not been built yet.** Every other
  French register here draws what stands: the cadastre the ground, BD TOPO the
  roofs, DPE their energy, DVF what they last sold for. This one draws the
  permits — granted, under construction, and in three métropoles, **still being
  instructed at the counter this week**. Scan a block and the cranes on it are
  cyan for a file still open, amber for granted, hot orange for a chantier
  running, green for finished.
- **The national register only holds permits that were GRANTED, and that is the
  whole reason the layer reads two.** Sitadel's own SDES dictionary says it in
  as many words. There is no national open feed of applications under
  instruction — Plat'AU, where every dematerialised file transits, is closed to
  accredited actors. So the layer reads Sitadel for the country (3 020 749 rows
  across four datafiles, republished monthly, running about six weeks behind
  the counter) and the ADS portals of **Paris, Bordeaux Métropole and Nantes
  Métropole** for the half Sitadel cannot publish. Measured 2026-09-02: 2 296
  Paris dossiers under instruction, deposits two days old.
- **The two registers merge on the dossier number rather than layering.** Both
  number a file the same way underneath — département, commune, year, sequence
  — Sitadel closed up (`07510826V0143`), the portals spaced and prefixed
  (`DP 075 108 26 V0143`). So one card says *"en cours d'instruction, déposé le
  6 mars"* from the counter and *"12 logements, 940 m²"* from the State,
  instead of drawing the same permit twice. Measured on a 400 m Nantes scan:
  **107 of 116 dossiers carried both halves**.
- **Sitadel carries no coordinate at all, and the layer says how sure each dot
  is.** Rows are placed by address through one bulk BAN call per commune.
  Measured on 211 Nantes authorisations: 167 resolve to a house number, 33 only
  to a street, 11 not at all. A permit geocoded to the middle of a street says
  so on its card; one the BAN can place no better than its commune is **dropped
  rather than drawn at the centroid**, and the count travels with the answer.
- **Sitadel keys Paris, Lyon and Marseille at COMMUNE level — the exact inverse
  of DVF.** `COMM=eq:75113` answers *"Le fichier est vide"*, `75056` answers
  the whole of Paris. Both layers resolve a point through the same BAN reverse
  call and then bend the answer in opposite directions. Getting it backwards
  yields an empty layer over the three densest cities in France, with no error.
- **Paris spells "no coordinate" as Lambert-93 (0, 0), and Opendatasoft
  reprojects it faithfully.** 19 rows, measured — and their `geo_point_2d`
  comes back as a perfectly well-formed pair off São Tomé. Nothing about the
  WGS84 coordinate reveals it; only the published `x`/`y` do, so that is what
  the guard reads.
- **DiDo rate-limits concurrent requests, and the failure is silent.** Firing
  the four Sitadel families in parallel returned **HTTP 429 on three of four**
  for Nantes while the same URLs answered 200 one at a time — a 429 becomes a
  null becomes an empty family, so the layer drew a city with no housing
  permits rather than reporting an outage. The families are sequential, and a
  family that fails is reported as failed, never as empty.
- **The Sitadel number series are PER FAMILY, and two of the files share one.**
  A mixed operation — flats over a shop — is filed once and listed in BOTH
  permis-de-construire files: 151 such pairs over Paris in three years, plus 12
  dossiers listed twice inside the non-residential file alone. They are folded
  into the one operation they are. But `NUM_PA` and `NUM_PD` are their own
  counters, and **271 numbers collide across series at completely different
  addresses** — folding on the bare number would have glued 271 unrelated Paris
  dossiers together, each inheriting the other's address and dwellings. Identity
  is series + number, never the number alone.
- **Three rows claiming one entity id is a render Cesium abandons half-way.**
  Found in the browser, not in a unit test: twelve markers drawn and the layer
  then frozen — no payload, no scan centre, no clickable cards, and no error
  anyone would connect to a data shape. The browser harness that caught it now
  covers this layer, and its click probe verifies a marker owns its own pixel
  before aiming at it — with six point layers over one block, clicking a
  covered marker tested Cesium's stacking rather than the layer's handler.
- **A certificat d'urbanisme is not permission to build, so it is not drawn.**
  Only Bordeaux publishes them — 174 662 of its 309 094 rows — and keeping them
  would make one métropole look three times busier than Paris for a category no
  other source has. They are counted and reported, so the exclusion is a stated
  line rather than a missing number.
- **Bordeaux draws the ground, not a dot on it.** One ADS portal in France
  publishes the emprise of the parcels a dossier names, and the layer now
  clamps it onto the terrain under the crane. A permit stops being a point on a
  street and becomes the plot it is about: the shape was checked against the
  IGN cadastre, which returns the same ring to the seventh decimal for parcel
  `33063000KD0112` — where the row's own `superficie` column says 5 471 m² and
  both geometries say 45. Paris and Nantes publish no shape, and their scans
  report zero plots rather than letting the absence look like a failure.
- **The outline belongs to the plot, and one plot is drawn once.** Bordeaux
  repeats the same emprise once per dossier standing on it: 392 dossiers over
  **252 distinct plots** on a 400 m scan of place Pey-Berland, one plot
  carrying nine. Drawn per dossier, translucent fills ADD — nine copies paint
  that plot at 0.83 alpha where a single one reads 0.18, so the thickest FILE
  on the block would have looked like the biggest project on it. The plot is
  identified by its GEOMETRY and merely named by its parcel references, because
  the same file writes those in two spellings and occasionally repeats one,
  each of which would split one plot into two stacked washes.
- **And the outlines cost less than nothing.** The certificats were being
  downloaded — outlines and all — only to be discarded a function later. Moving
  that exclusion into the query and asking the portal to COUNT them instead
  turns a 400 m Bordeaux scan from 416 KB without any geometry into **391 KB
  with all of it**; the naive version would have been 1 338 KB. ODSQL has no
  `<>`, and the export endpoint answers a syntax error with HTTP 200 and a JSON
  error object, which reads as a short answer rather than as a failure.
- **A published polygon is not a valid one, and the publisher's own flag is not
  the test.** Bordeaux ships its emprises out of Oracle Spatial with the
  validation verdict attached: 428 rows are flagged, and 108 of those carry no
  geometry at all — those keep their point. Dropping the other 320 was measured
  and rejected: against each row's own stated area they draw at a median 0.997
  of it. What is repaired instead is what a renderer cannot take — every ring
  arrives closed and leaves open, and 45 rings across 134 413 rows write a
  vertex twice in a row. Requiring a hole to sit inside its outer ring was
  written, measured and removed: it would have silently filled in three genuine
  courtyards of 787, 754 and 249 m², none of them flagged by the publisher.
- **La fenêtre devient un réglage, et le défaut ne bouge pas.** Trois pastilles sur la ligne de la couche — **3 ANS / 6 ANS / 13 ANS** — là où la requête portait deux constantes gelées. 3 ans reste le défaut, donc rien ne change pour qui ne touche à rien. Les deux autres rungs ne sont pas décoratifs : 13 ans est l'amplitude entière de Sitadel, et **6 ans est le plus court qui atteint une maison finie** — le PC d'Ustaritz autorisé le 2021-07-20, lu en 2026-09, tombe sous le plancher de 36 mois. Un chantier survit à la fenêtre qui le montre. Vérifié dans le navigateur : à 3 ans le dossier est absent du calque, à 6 ans son marqueur est dessiné.
- **Le choix voyage dans le lien de partage** (`lo=au.w.6`), première option jamais portée par l'une des six couches d'adresse : une fenêtre est une question, et rouvrir le même pâté de maisons sur six ans est une autre réponse. Les valeurs forment un ensemble **fermé** — tout ce qui est atteignable ici l'est aussi depuis l'URL d'un inconnu, donc une valeur hors liste est **refusée** et non rabotée sur la plus proche. Un lien d'un build qui proposait un quatrième rung retombe sur le défaut au lieu de répondre à une question que personne n'a posée.
- **La pastille active porte l'avertissement de troncature**, parce qu'élargir la fenêtre est ce qui la provoque : `ADS_MAX_PERMITS` sert les 400 dossiers les plus proches, donc sur un bloc dense une fenêtre plus longue n'ajoute pas d'histoire, elle **échange** le bord du cercle contre elle — et rien à l'écran ne le dit. L'infobulle l'annonce au moment du choix.
- **La parcelle plutôt que l'adresse — le sol de la France entière, sans Bordeaux.** Sitadel ne publie aucune coordonnée mais nomme jusqu'à trois parcelles par dossier, et le cadastre est ouvert. La couche résout donc le dossier sur son emprise avant de le géocoder : **58,1 % des 543 lignes d'Ustaritz** et **2 307 lignes de Paris** cessent d'être une adresse devinée pour devenir le terrain sur lequel le permis a été déposé. Un dossier ainsi placé n'entre plus dans le lot BAN — le placement s'améliore et l'appel rétrécit. Effet de bord mesuré : une panne du géocodeur ne vide plus le scan, les dossiers debout sur leur parcelle y survivent.
- **Et quand la parcelle n'existe plus, c'est le permis qui l'a tuée.** 37,3 % des lignes nomment une parcelle absente du cadastre d'aujourd'hui — non pas une erreur, mais une division : on dépose sur un pré, on découpe le pré, on bâtit sur un lot. Etalab publie des éditions **datées** du cadastre depuis le 2017-07-06 ; la couche remonte l'échelle jusqu'à retrouver la parcelle vivante, intersecte avec le cadastre courant et lit la division. Sur `06454721B0009` à Ustaritz : AN 221 vivante au 2021-04-01, disparue au 2021-07-01, soit trois mois avant l'autorisation ; ses trois enfants — AN 511 (811 m²), AN 512 (527) et AN 513 (34) — totalisent **1 372 m² contre 1 372 pour le parent, au mètre près**.
- **Le lot bâti se lit dans le diff du bâti, pas dans le dossier.** Les mêmes éditions datées portent les bâtiments : AN 511 avait déjà ses 188 + 12 m² en 2021 et n'a rien gagné, AN 513 est la bande de desserte, **AN 512 passe de zéro à un bâtiment de 76 m²**. C'est la maison — et la BAL la nomme *18 impasse de Haroztegia*, un numéro qui n'apparaît nulle part dans le permis. Il tombe de la chaîne.
- **Quand aucun lot ne se distingue, c'est l'emprise mère qui est dessinée.** Mesuré sur les 125 divisions ambiguës d'Ustaritz depuis 2018, le diff du bâti ne désigne un lot unique que dans **29,6 %** des cas ; 45,6 % ont plusieurs enfants bâtis et 24,8 % rien du tout. Les deux tiers restants reçoivent donc le parent, étiqueté « emprise avant division » : un polygone qui contient certainement le chantier vaut mieux qu'un point sûr de lui au milieu de la chaussée. La fiche imprime laquelle des trois preuves a tranché, parce qu'une déduction dessinée comme un relevé est exactement l'erreur que tout ceci évite.
- **Un permis d'aménager reste sur le parent, et deux dossiers qui se disputent un lot n'en obtiennent aucun.** Trouvé dans le navigateur et non en test unitaire : le PA qui a découpé AN 221 et le PC qui a bâti dessus nomment la même parcelle, et résolus un par un ils atterrissaient **tous les deux** sur le lot bâti — la couche dessinait le permis qui a créé trois lots comme s'il portait sur l'un d'eux. Un permis d'aménager n'est pas un projet sur un lot, c'est l'acte de tracer les lots ; et « le seul lot construit depuis » n'identifie personne quand deux dossiers le revendiquent. Seul leur propre numéro BAL peut alors les séparer.
- **Les limites sont chiffrées, pas tues.** L'archive Etalab commence en juillet 2017 : les permis de 2013 à 2016 perdent 61 lignes sur 161, contre 5 sur 227 pour 2018-2021. Une référence à suffixe (`255P`, *partie de parcelle*) est signalée pour ce qu'elle est plutôt que rembourrée en un numéro qui n'existe pas. Et les enfants qui ne totalisent pas leur parent à 12 % près sont refusés au lieu d'être dessinés. Le décompte complet — placés sur parcelle, divisés, résolus, sur un lot, sur le parent — voyage jusqu'à la fiche de la couche.
- **IPS des écoles — le dernier point du brief, et ce n'est pas une couche.** L'*indice de position sociale* de la DEPP ne publie aucune coordonnée : ses 43 322 lignes sont clés sur l'UAI et rien d'autre, donc une couche devrait emprunter sa géométrie à `schools-fr` — c'est-à-dire qu'elle SERAIT `schools-fr`. L'indice arrive donc comme la cinquième jointure sur l'UAI de ce fichier, à côté des quatre fichiers d'effectifs qui donnent déjà la taille des points. Sans clé, Licence Ouverte 2.0, via le proxy `/api/schools-fr` existant.
- **La couleur veut toujours dire NIVEAU et la taille toujours EFFECTIF.** Rien de ce qui est à l'écran ne change quand on active la couche. Il n'y a pas d'échelle de couleur IPS, même optionnelle : le canal couleur porte déjà un sens, et un second sens caché derrière un interrupteur ferait dire deux choses différentes à deux captures de la même couche sans que rien à l'écran ne les distingue. L'indice arrive là où il peut être qualifié — sur la fiche, et sur la ligne sous l'interrupteur.
- **Un établissement sur trois n'a pas d'IPS, et sa fiche le dit.** Mesuré le 2026-09-02 contre les fichiers vivants : `schools-fr` dessine 68 158 lignes ouvertes et géolocalisées sur **68 083 UAI distincts**, dont **62 857 peuvent porter un indice** (Ecole 48 169 · Collège 9 055 · Lycée 5 547 · EREA 79, plus 7 que l'annuaire laisse sans type et que la DEPP indexe quand même). **42 974 trouvent une ligne IPS (68,4 %)** et **40 529 en rapportent un nombre (64,5 %)** : Ecole 66,9 % / 61,8 %, Collège 77,8 % / 77,7 %, Lycée 65,4 % / 65,4 %, EREA 97,5 % / 97,5 %. Les 22 328 autres portent *IPS non publié pour cet UAI* — jamais dessinés, jamais colorés, jamais lus comme moyens.
- **Quatre fichiers, quatre rentrées différentes : un `max()` global efface 32 494 écoles.** `fr-en-ips-ecoles-ap2022` s'arrête à **2024-2025 (32 494 lignes)** là où les collèges (7 089), les lycées (3 662) et les EREA (77) atteignent **2025-2026**. Chaque jeu découvre donc SA propre rentrée par son `group_by=rentree_scolaire`, plancher à la valeur mesurée, comparée comme chaîne `YYYY-YYYY` derrière un garde de format — `Number('2024-2025')` vaut NaN, un max numérique rendrait le plancher pour toujours. Les fichiers sont en plus cumulatifs (97 080 lignes écoles = trois années empilées), donc la rentrée est épinglée dans le `where`.
- **Les lycées n'ont pas de colonne `ips`, et leur chiffre d'établissement mélange deux populations que le fichier publie séparément.** Ils publient `ips_voie_gt`, `ips_voie_pro`, `ips_post_bac` et `ips_etab` avec `type_de_lycee` ∈ {LEGT 1 565, LP 1 097, LPO 1 000} — une jointure écrite contre `ips` en perd 3 662. `ips_etab` est le chiffre retenu (seule colonne définie sur 3 661 des 3 662, seule comparable entre les trois types), mais la fiche le nomme comme chiffre d'établissement puis nomme les voies dessous : sur les **931 LPO qui portent les deux, l'écart médian GT / pro est de 18,1 points, le neuvième décile 27,9, et le plus large est 0312746S à GT 140,1 contre pro 92,4** — 47,7 points dans un `ips_etab` de 126,3. Ce n'est pas non plus une copie d'une voie unique : 2 042 lignes portent `ips_post_bac`, replié dans `ips_etab` et nulle part ailleurs.
- **`fr-en-ips-erea-ap2022` écrit mal le nom de sa propre colonne, et c'est un HTTP 400.** `nom_de_l_etablissment`, sans le second « e ». Vérifié dans les deux sens le 2026-09-02 : l'orthographe correcte renvoie `ODSQL query is malformed: Unknown field: nom_de_l_etablissement. Clause(s) containing the error(s): select.` sur les EREA, et la faute renvoie la même chose sur les écoles. Le `select` est construit par jeu de données, jamais partagé.
- **La référence est par type pour les lycées : LEGT 120,2, LPO 104,4, LP 89,9.** 30 points d'un bout à l'autre — comparer un LP à la référence LEGT n'est pas un arrondi, c'est un mauvais chiffre. La fiche porte la référence départementale et nationale du type de l'établissement, et l'écart au département. Deux cas mesurés renvoient l'écart à la référence nationale : la référence départementale manque (2 LEGT, 10 LPO, 3 LP) ou elle ÉGALE l'indice de l'école, donc elle la contient et presque rien d'autre — **184 lignes, dont 49 des 77 EREA**, puisqu'il y a au plus un EREA par département. Avec ni l'une ni l'autre (94 collèges et 39 lycées n'ont pas d'`ips_national`), la fiche donne les ancrages qu'elle a et aucun écart.
- **« NS » est une valeur publiée, et `Number('NS')` vaut NaN.** Le fichier écoles écrit littéralement `"NS"` — *non significatif*, le marqueur de secret statistique de la DEPP — dans **2 504 de ses 32 494 lignes (7,7 %)**. `Number(ligne.ips) || 0` en ferait 2 504 IPS de **0** sur une échelle dont l'étendue mesurée est 54,9 à 162,7. Elles sont lues comme sentinelle et la fiche dit *IPS non significatif (« NS ») — effectif trop faible*, ce qui n'est pas la même chose qu'une école que la DEPP n'a jamais examinée. Deux autres vides existent : 2 collèges publient `ips = null` et 1 lycée publie toutes ses colonnes IPS nulles. Au total **2 445 établissements dessinés sont DANS les fichiers de la DEPP et n'ont quand même pas d'indice**.
- **L'écart-type a fallu sa propre fenêtre de vraisemblance, et réutiliser celle de l'indice en mangeait 162.** La dispersion intra-établissement va de **7,9** (0752954D) à 46,2, donc un plancher d'indice à 20 supprimait en silence 102 collèges, 39 lycées et 21 des 77 EREA. Ce n'est pas la même grandeur que l'indice qu'elle disperse.
- **Le maillage ne porte pas un octet d'IPS.** Ce paquet expédie des coordonnées SANS les noms pour tenir à 1,66 Mo contre 5,42 Mo ; un indice par tuple l'y ramènerait. L'indice emprunte donc le chemin de clic que le NOM paie déjà : une lecture du registre pour une coordonnée, mémorisée pour la session, et la fiche produite est exactement celle du régime exact, IPS compris. Coût mesuré ailleurs : huit requêtes une fois par processus (**7 598 242 octets bruts / 750 413 gzippés, 3,4 s à froid, 0,64 s à chaud** ; les quatre exports toutes colonnes feraient 33 040 379 / 1 587 950), et sur la vue la plus dense de France (0,34° sur Paris, 4 725 établissements) **+473 636 octets bruts (+17,0 %) et +30 741 sur le fil (+8,8 %)**.
- **Perdre la DEPP ne casse pas la couche.** Vérifié de bout en bout en pointant le portail IPS sur un hôte inexistant : la vue rend toujours ses 195 établissements, 169 portent *Indice de position sociale indisponible — fichier DEPP injoignable* et zéro porte « non publié », le rollup national reste intact avec `ips.status: unavailable`. Un seul fichier en panne ne coûte son indice qu'à son niveau. Les deux caches disque sont versionnés pour l'occasion (`SCHOOLS_NATIONAL_CACHE_VERSION` 1 → 2, et un `SCHOOLS_VIEWPORT_CACHE_VERSION` neuf à 2), sans quoi une boîte mise en cache dans les six dernières heures aurait continué à servir des fiches muettes sur l'indice.
- **Équipements du quotidien — les sept choses qu'une vie quotidienne touche, et les cinq que la carte refuse de redessiner.** Nouvelle couche `amenities-fr` (🏪, jeton `bq`, catégorie BÂTI & TERRITOIRE) sur la Base permanente des équipements 2025 de l'Insee et le registre FINESS : 126 859 lignes de registre repliées en **95 406 points** — 30 215 médecins généralistes, 19 354 commerces alimentaires, 19 216 pharmacies, 16 832 guichets La Poste, 3 953 gendarmeries et commissariats, 3 625 bassins de natation, 2 211 hôpitaux. Sans clé, Licence Ouverte, via le proxy `/api/amenities-fr`.
- **Aucune école, et c'est le premier choix de conception.** Le brief demandait « écoles » en tête de ligne ; la couche n'en dessine pas une. `schools-fr` trace déjà les 68 158 établissements ouverts et géolocalisés de l'Annuaire du ministère, clé UAI, et `sup-fr` 6 914 sites du supérieur — tandis que les 79 743 lignes DOM=C de la BPE (C1 écoles 48 661, C2 collèges 7 532, C3 lycées 5 872) **ne portent aucune colonne UAI** : les 95 colonnes livrées ont été vérifiées une à une, aucune ne permet de rapprocher une école BPE d'une école déjà tracée autrement que par appariement d'adresses. Son géocodage est en plus mesurablement moins bon (79,2 % de `QUALITE_XY = B` sur tout le fichier, 124 107 lignes sans latitude). La légende porte donc une ligne « Écoles — non dessinées ici » avec le compte et la destination, parce qu'un lecteur qui ne les trouve pas doit être renseigné, pas laissé à conclure qu'il manque des données.
- **insee.fr renvoie 200 sans en-tête `Origin` et 403 avec.** Vérifié deux fois le 2026-09-02 depuis `http://localhost:4173`, sur la page, sur `BPE25.zip` et sur `BPE25.parquet`, en GET comme en HEAD — un HEAD nu renvoie 200, ce qui fait croire à l'absence de blocage. Le serveur ignore aussi `Range` (200 et non 206, et il commence à diffuser les 142 Mo) et ne renvoie pas de `Content-Length`. Aucun navigateur ne peut lire ce fichier, aucune clé n'y change rien : le pliage se fait dans le proxy ou pas du tout. Build à froid mesuré de bout en bout sur les amonts réels : **52,9 s**, dont 51 s de téléchargement ; l'inflation des 1 515 251 530 octets et la lecture des 2 921 770 lignes prennent **8,7 s**.
- **Un point que le registre avoue avoir inventé n'est pas dessiné — et les deux registres l'avouent différemment.** La BPE publie `QUALITE_GEOLOC = 33`, que l'Insee traduit mot pour mot par « Voie inconnue, Position aléatoire dans la commune » : **1 284 lignes** sur les dix codes retenus, et le mot « aléatoire » est littéral — sur les 207 communes portant plus d'une de ces lignes (724 lignes), **3 seulement** contiennent une coordonnée répétée. FINESS le dit autrement : **4 646 lignes sont géocodées sur `ADMIN-EXPRESS-2023`** avec un score `.` au lieu d'un nombre, et la partition est exacte (BAN 88 737 et BDADRESSE 9 535 ont un score, ADMIN-EXPRESS 4 646 et MAPS 19 n'en ont pas). Ce sont des centroïdes de commune, prouvés et non supposés : **2 612 des 2 619 lignes ADMIN-EXPRESS partageant une commune avec une autre sont sur une coordonnée identique à l'octet près**, contre 1 608 sur 84 561 pour le témoin BAN — quatre établissements de Bourg-en-Bresse sont tous à 5,224702 / 46,205283. Au total **2 182 positions refusées**, comptées par famille sur la fiche, plus 170 lignes sans aucune coordonnée.
- **Les 100 équipements quotidiens de Mayotte existent comme comptage et pas comme lieux.** Les 40 médecins, 14 bureaux de poste, 5 supermarchés, 7 gendarmeries et 3 bassins que la BPE recense dans le 976 ont **LATITUDE, LONGITUDE, LAMBERT_X et LAMBERT_Y vides** tout en déclarant `EPSG=4471`. C'est 100 des 170 lignes sans coordonnée de toute la sélection. L'île ne porte donc aucun équipement BPE sur cette carte, et la fiche le dit ; ce qu'on y voit vient de FINESS, qui place ses 189 établissements de santé dont 28 pharmacies et 7 hôpitaux.
- **FINESS ne publie pas de latitude : des mètres projetés dans cinq CRS, nommés dans un champ libre.** `coordxet`/`coordyet` sont en mètres et la projection est le **cinquième jeton séparé par virgule** de `sourcecoordet`. Sur les 103 032 lignes, les 102 937 valeurs non vides se coupent **toutes** en exactement cinq jetons avec le CRS en position 4 — y compris les deux lignes `4,ATLASANTE,.,MAPS 06-11-2024,WGS84/UTM zone 1S (Wallis-et-Futuna)` dont on dit souvent que les jetons se décalent, et dont ils ne se décalent pas. Une expression régulière sur `EPSG:(\d+)` perdrait en silence **18 lignes sans préfixe** (16 à Saint-Pierre-et-Miquelon, 2 à Wallis-et-Futuna). Passer les 2 659 lignes non métropolitaines dans l'inverse Lambert-93 les déplace de **6 990 km en médiane** (4 632 km au minimum, 21 004 km au maximum : l'Hôpital de Sia, à Wallis, atterrit à 0,88 E / 63,57 N, en mer de Norvège). Tous les datums ultramarins étant GRS80, une seule inverse UTM paramétrée par fuseau et hémisphère couvre les sept cas.
- **Le point dessiné est une ADRESSE, pas une ligne de registre — parce que la BPE n'a aucune clé.** IDEQUIP, IDSOURCE et SOU sont documentés dans le dessin de fichier et ne sont pas livrés, et le SIRET est vide sur tout équipement hors Sirene. Or les lignes s'empilent : **60 270 médecins généralistes occupent 30 215 coordonnées distinctes**, dont 12 084 en portent plusieurs et une en porte **146** (Paris 14e). 126 859 lignes deviennent donc 95 406 points, chacun disant combien d'établissements il représente et nommant les quatre premiers, le reste étant compté. Les familles ne fusionnent jamais entre elles : 1 137 positions portent deux familles différentes, et une pharmacie dans un supermarché, ce sont deux choses.
- **La vue nationale peint une PART, pas un compte — et c'est le compte qui le décide.** Le nombre d'équipements par département va de 186 (Territoire de Belfort) et 221 (Lozère) à 3 560 (Nord) et 3 710 (Paris), soit à trois chiffres près l'ordre de la population. La couche peint donc quelque chose d'indépendant de la population, tiré du même fichier : la BPE liste **34 915 codes DEPCOM** (la commune, et l'arrondissement municipal pour Paris, Lyon et Marseille), dont **34 778 se replient sur un polygone métropolitain**, et la teinte dit combien d'entre eux portent au moins un des cinq équipements que la BPE fournit. Nationalement **15 196 sur 34 778 = 43,7 %** ; par département de 21,6 % (Gers), 22,0 % (Hautes-Pyrénées), 22,5 % (Somme) et 22,6 % (Ardennes, Meuse) à 100 % (Paris, Hauts-de-Seine, Seine-Saint-Denis, Val-de-Marne), médiane 48,8 %. Les deux familles FINESS sont volontairement hors du ratio et la fiche le dit : FINESS publie une ligne d'acheminement postal, pas un code commune Insee.
- **Le maillage éclaircit famille par famille, parce que les familles vont de 1 à 13,7.** Sur une seule passe globale au budget national de 1 100 points, la répartition mesurée est médecin 414 · commerce 179 · pharmacie 139 · poste 284 · bassin 25 · gendarmerie 45 · **hôpital 14** — quatorze hôpitaux pour un pays qui en compte 2 211. Sept passes séparées avec un plancher de `budget / (4 × familles)` donnent médecin 331 · commerce 223 · pharmacie 222 · poste 197 · bassin 42 · gendarmerie 46 · **hôpital 39**, et la légende imprime tracés-sur-en-vue par famille, parce que le mélange à l'écran n'est alors plus le mélange réel. Le poids que la sélection classe est la **précision de géocodage** : quand une cellule ne garde qu'un point, elle garde celui dont le registre est le plus sûr.
- **La taille d'un point ne veut rien dire, et c'est écrit.** `schools-fr` dimensionne par effectif, `sup-fr` par inscrits, `irve-fr` par puissance ; ici aucun des deux registres ne publie de magnitude. La taille est donc une règle de lisibilité inverse à l'effectif national (médecin 6,5 px pour 30 215 points, hôpital 12 px pour 2 211) et aucune fiche ne la relit comme un nombre. Le second canal est celui que les registres publient vraiment : **108 573 des 126 859 lignes retenues sont au numéro de voirie** (`QUALITE_GEOLOC = 11` ou score FINESS ≥ 95) et portent un halo sable ; 12 990 sont à la voie, 912 en « voie probable » et 4 384 sans aucune précision publiée — dont **3 626 bassins de natation, le recensement sportif n'étant pas géocodé par la chaîne d'adressage de la BPE** (3 632 de ses 3 633 lignes sont `_Z`). Les deux bandes basses perdent le halo et 40 à 50 % de leur opacité.
- **Quatre autres refus, chacun avec sa mesure.** B326 stations de recharge (28 819) : `irve-fr` lit le même fait en direct sur 39 579 coordonnées, montrer un instantané 2025 à côté serait un second avis périmé. DOM=E transports (99 280) : 96 253 sont des adresses d'exploitants de taxis et VTC, et les 2 938 gares et 89 aéroports appartiennent à `transit-fr` et `local-airports`. D307 pharmacies (20 334) : FINESS répond pour cette famille, avec `nofinesset` unique sur 103 032 lignes sans un seul doublon et une actualisation mensuelle. D106 urgences (695) : mesuré et non supposé — **547 des 694 géolocalisées sont à moins de 200 m d'un hôpital FINESS déjà dessiné, 665 à moins de 1 km, médiane 79 m** ; ce sont des services à l'intérieur des bâtiments déjà tracés.
- **Trois vocabulaires pour les mêmes départements, donc aucune jointure par code.** La BPE écrit `971 972 973 974 976` et la Corse `2A`/`2B` ; FINESS écrit `9A 9B 9C 9D 9F`, plus `9E` pour Saint-Pierre-et-Miquelon et `9J` pour Wallis-et-Futuna ; les contours IGN embarqués en utilisent un troisième. Chaque point et chaque commune est placé par point-dans-polygone avec l'accroche côtière partagée de 2 km : **92 725 des 95 406 points rattachés, dont 307 accrochés à la côte, et 2 681 hors de tout polygone métropolitain**, signalés plutôt que traînés sur l'un d'eux.
- **Sitadel — the only forward-looking layer on the globe, drawn on the parcels the permits were granted for.** France publishes every building authorisation since 2013 — 3 020 749 across four files — and not one of them carries a coordinate: 94 columns on the housing register, 33 on the demolitions, `geoFields: ["REG","DEP"]` on both. The new layer reads the two files that answer "what will be here" (1 917 260 + 202 895 permits, 70,2 % of the corpus) and turns each one into the exact cadastral parcel it was granted for, by joining `SEC_CADASTRE1..3`/`NUM_CADASTRE1..3` to the same Etalab cadastre `cadastre-fr` draws.
- **The join rate travels with every object, because it is the finding.** Measured 2026-09-02 over six communes and both files against cadastre edition 2026-06-01: 21 271 permits, **9 744 placed (45,8 %)** — Paris 91,3 %, Nantes 75,6 %, Ustaritz 55,1 %, Beaupréau-en-Mauges 54,5 %, Marseille 20,1 %, Toulouse 7,6 %. For calibration, DREAL Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes published the same join officially and placed 162 171 of 362 038 (44,8 %). Every card prints its commune's rate AND its year's, and the row line prints the count that was not placed.
- **Two different failures, kept apart, because a reader can act on the difference.** *Missing* means the parcel was divided and renumbered — which is what happens when somebody builds on it, so Nantes places 60 % of 2013 and 97 % of 2026, and its single largest permit (553 dwellings, 2015) is one of the losses. *Ambiguous* means the commune publishes section préfixes Sitadel has no column for: Toulouse's 46 préfixes put 34 different parcels under the key `31555AB0069`, so a last-writer-wins index "places" 97,7 % of its permits and is wrong about nearly all of them, while refusing the tie places 9,5 % and is right.
- **The declared plot surface audits the join independently, and ranks the communes the same way.** `SUPERFICIE_TERRAIN` places nothing; compared with the area actually drawn it agrees within a factor of two for 98,4 % of Paris' placed permits, 94,2 % of Nantes', 86,4 % of Beaupréau's, 84,7 % of Ustaritz', 68,6 % of Marseille's and **51,5 % of Toulouse's**. Each card carries its own ratio and the word CONCORDANT or DISCORDANT.
- **Three real dates, not one — which is what makes this different from `dvf-sales`.** `ETAT_DAU` and the three dates give four states of a project and they are the colour: `Autorisé` (nothing further reported), `Chantier ouvert` (a DATE_REELLE_DOC exists), `Travaux achevés` (a DATE_REELLE_DAACT exists), `Annulé`. Demolitions get a fifth band of their own rather than being coloured by `ETAT_PD`, which carries no information — 1 497 of Nantes' 1 587 and 1 582 of Paris' 1 609 sit at *Autorisé*. Dot size is dwellings CREATED, square-rooted, capped at 200.
- **ONE commune at a time, and the arithmetic is the reason.** DiDo answers a filtered, column-projected query by scanning an 889 MB CSV: 3,57–5,01 s regardless of the answer's size, so a national pass would be 39 hours. The layer resolves the commune under the middle of the screen through `geo.api.gouv.fr`, gates at 12 000 m of camera altitude (2·h·tan 30° = 13,86 km of ground, against communes 12,1–17,9 km wide, measured from their own parcel bounds), and draws the commune contour so the neighbouring commune reads as *never asked* rather than *nothing here*.
- **DiDo refuses a fourth simultaneous request, and nothing upstream of this said so.** Six parallel queries returned three HTTP 200 and three HTTP 429 within 145 ms, body `max connections reached: 3` — with no `content-type`, no `retry-after` and no CORS header. The proxy holds a global semaphore of two; three simultaneous commune builds (six queries) complete in 10,5 s at peak concurrency 2 with no refusal.
- **Panning is free.** `/api/sitadel-fr/commune` takes `have=<insee>` and answers an unchanged commune in **53 bytes** instead of the 2 085 535-byte Nantes pack or the 3 144 667-byte Paris one. Cold build 5,9–7,6 s, warm 8,6 ms from memory, 126 ms from the disk cache under `.gev-cache/sitadel-fr/`.
- **No coverage rectangle, on purpose.** Sitadel and the Etalab cadastre both cover the DROM — Saint-Denis de La Réunion answers with 2 849 permits and a 10,4 MB parcel file — so a metropolitan box would have refused them while claiming national coverage. A point with no French commune under it is a real answer that clears the map instead of leaving the last commune's permits drawn over ground they do not cover.
- **`idfm-frequency` — the first time-of-day dimension in God's Eye View.** Île-de-France Mobilités' own *Offre hebdomadaire moyenne hors vacances*: **1,311,578 rows** of average departures per stop, per line and per one-hour band for a term-time week of 2025, Licence Ouverte v2.0. `transit-fr` consumes zero IDFM data because IDFM publishes no vehicle positions (0 in Paris intra-muros against 453 in Bordeaux) and `idfm-network` draws the offer as a static referential, so "how often does anything stop here at 08:00 versus 22:00" was previously unanswerable on this globe.
- **One number moves as you scrub the clock, on a FIXED ladder.** Six steps at 2/4/8/16/32 departures an hour, never a quantile, so a colour means the same wait everywhere and at every hour. Measured on the 805 stops of a 4 km box on Châtelet, on an average Tuesday: **115 stops above 32/h at 08:00 and exactly 1 at 22:00; at 01:00, 397 of the 805 run nothing at all.** Saint-Lazare (métro) is 37/h at 08:00 and 8.7/h at 22:00.
- **Silence is measured, so it is not grey.** A stop that publishes a profile and has no course in the selected band was measured and the published answer is zero, so it keeps its own colour, its own size, its own legend row and its own card sentence — and `fraicheur-fr`'s repo-wide grey `#8a93a6` ("the register did not measure this") is deliberately not borrowed for it. A silent stop is also never offered to DETECT.
- **The operating day is 04:00 → 03:59, and the night bands are kept.** `min/max(tranche_horaire)` is 4 and 27; band 25 is 01:00–01:59. Validating 0..23 would delete the half of the day that separates two addresses, and it is where the largest signal is: **band 25 is 15,904 courses region-wide on a Monday and 31,585 on a Friday, +98.6 %**. 01:30 on a Wednesday is mapped onto TUESDAY's band 25.
- **A wide view gets the same ladder in the same unit.** 356 aggregate rows and 17 enumerated stop censuses fold to **14,719 bytes raw / 5,864 gzipped** in 54 ms, painting 8 départements by departures per hour PER STOP: Paris **13.22** at 08:00 against Seine-et-Marne's **3.00**, and **7.13 against 0.61** at 22:00 — the gap more than doubles after dark. The divisor is enumerated, not counted, because Opendatasoft's `count(distinct id_arret)` is an estimator that answers 3,452 for Paris where enumerating returns 3,506.
- **Designed around a deliberate overlap with `idfm-network`.** 34,903 of these 36,502 stops (95.6 %) join `arrets.arrid` and another 518 join `zdaid` — 97.0 % in all — so both layers mark the same coordinate. Measured on the 805-stop box: median nearest-neighbour **24.2 m**, 463 stops with a neighbour inside 30 m. So the rate disc is 4.5–13 px, strictly under `idfm-network`'s smallest pictogram (14 px), its interior is translucent so the mode glyph reads through whichever paints last, the ramp is a desaturated cold→warm ladder holding none of that layer's five saturated mode hues, and record ids are namespaced `idfm-freq:` so a click on a stacked stop is never ambiguous to `pickRegistry`.
- **549 stops (1.50 %) publish no coordinate and are counted, never placed.** They are exactly the null-`code_departement` bucket — and `where=code_departement="None"` returns HTTP 200 with zero rows, so the predicate has to be `is null` or all 549 vanish without an error. 473 Train, 69 Bus, 7 Tramway, carrying **84,768 of the 3,071,759 average-Tuesday courses (2.76 %)**. 518 join a stop ZONE in the referential, but 512 of those zones have two or more platform coordinates, so there is no single published point to borrow.
- **Eight départements outside Île-de-France hold 235 stops between them and stay unpainted.** 60 (87 stops) · 28 (82) · 27 (36) · 89 (11) · 02 (9) · 45 (7) · 10 (2) · 51 (1). The paint threshold is 1,000 stops and it is not tuned: the smallest painted bucket has 2,971 and the largest unpainted one 87, a 2,884-stop gap.
- **The published département code and the IGN outlines disagree on 542 of 35,953 stops (1.51 %), and the layer says so instead of correcting it.** 35,411 agree, 0 fall outside all 96 polygons, 0 need a coast snap; the largest single flow is 49 stops published as 75 that sit inside 92. The courses are only published per code, so repartitioning the divisor by polygon would divide one partition by another.
- **A box past the ceiling is refused after ONE call.** The identity query asks for 1,201 rows so a full page is the signal. Measured at Châtelet on square boxes: 4 km 802 stops, 5 km 1,133, and every box from 5.5 km up returns exactly 1,201 rows — so the refusal tests page saturation, not the distinct count, which is always under the ceiling on a truncated page. Refusals cost 531 bytes and 194–422 ms instead of four heavy pages.
- **One failed band window is a hole in the DAY, not a hole in the map, and it is named.** The viewport's profiles arrive as four pages split on the band axis; the proxy reports `windows: {asked, answered}` and both the row and the card say how many are missing, because an unnamed hole in the sparkline reads as "no service between 16:00 and 21:00".
- **Two defects fixed in `idfmFrequencyFeed.js`, both of the coercion class.** `bandLabel(null)` printed `00:00–00:59` — a real, readable clock face for a band the publisher does not have — because `Math.trunc(Number(null))` is 0 and `Number.isFinite(0)` is true; and `clampBand(null)` returned band 4 while `clampBand(undefined)` returned the documented default of 8, from the same function, for the same absence. `num('')` also returned 0 rather than null. All three now guard before the coercion, and 22 assertions in `idfmFrequencyFeed.test.mjs` hold them to it.
- **Provenance.** Edition discovered from the portal's own `data_processed` and floored at 2026-08-18T15:54:55+00:00; an older discovery is a malformed answer, not a new fact. Licence Ouverte v2.0 for the frequency figures, and the layer ships its own credit line rather than sharing `idfm-network`'s ODbL 1.0 one, because the two obligations are not the same.
- **Aircraft-noise plans, and a layer that refuses to guess which zone you are in.** New `bruit-fr` layer (token `bz`, 🔊, RISQUES & ENVIRONNEMENT): the DGAC's *plan d'exposition au bruit* and *plan de gêne sonore* read under the point the camera is looking at, from the keyless Géoplateforme WMS-V. 224 aerodromes carry a PEB; 215 of them answer with geometry at their own published point.
- **The dB label is fabricated on a third of French aerodromes if you print the register as published — so this layer prints the index instead.** `indldenext`/`indldenint` mix the *indice psophique* France abandoned in 2002 with Lden dB(A). Measured over the 298 zone rows one probe at each of the 224 aerodromes returns: **75 rows on a pre-2002 arrêté with values 78 … 96, and 223 on a later one with values 50 … 70**, two ranges that do not overlap. The unit is taken from the LATER of `date_arret` and the date inside the arrêté PDF — LFNA (Gap-Tallard) publishes 1985-07-01 on a plan reissued 11/04/2017 — and where the date rule and the value range disagree the unit is SUPPRESSED, not guessed. Nothing converts psophique to decibels: the correspondence is a regulatory table, not a formula.
- **34% of probes return more than one polygon, so the layer ranks them and says on the card which clause won.** Features per probe over 224 aerodromes: 0 → 9, 1 → 141, 2 → 67, 3 → 5, 4 → 2. Taking `features[0]` would be a coin toss on a third of France. A band the point is not inside (measured at Les Mureaux: 4 features, 2 of them containing the probe) is drawn DASHED as context and can never be the answer; the same band published twice (LFPV, LFXU, LFGQ, LFPZ — where the two copies disagree about `producteur` and `date_maj`) is merged with its piece count; and where two zones genuinely both cover the point the **strictest** wins, because the PEB's restrictions are cumulative-strictest. At Saint-Cyr-l'École zone B has no hole cut where zone A sits, so 48,81025 / 2,07712 is inside both — the card reads “2 zones sous le repère — retenue : la plus exposée des zones sous le repère” and names zone B underneath it.
- **Two airports at one point are two facts.** At Le Bourget the probe returns Le Bourget's own zone A (arrêté 2017) and Roissy's zone D (arrêté 2007) — 15 041 bytes, 742 vertices, the heaviest response in the register — and the card names both rather than folding twelve years of arrêtés into one answer.
- **The probe scale is pinned, because the service goes silent with HTTP 200.** `dgac_peb_plan_wmsv` stops rendering below ~1:25 000 and answers a 137-byte empty FeatureCollection, which reads exactly like “no noise plan here”. The probe is fixed at 1e-4° per pixel (1:39 757, a 59% margin) and never derived from the camera. At that scale 9 aerodromes answer nothing at their own reference point; six of them do answer at a coarser probe and every one of those features is OUTSIDE the point, and the remaining three — Toussus-le-Noble, Coulommiers, Pontoise — have an arrêté and no polygon at any scale.
- **An empty probe gets a sentence, not a blank.** The national arrêté register (224 points, 66 355 B, disk-cached for 7 days) turns “nothing here” into “the nearest aerodrome with a PEB is LFPG — P. CH. DE GAULLE, 39,4 km away, arrêté du 03/04/2007”, from the register's own published coordinate and never a commune centroid. Standing ON an aerodrome that answers nothing, it says that instead. And a register that came back short says so on the card, because “the nearest” out of a truncated index is confidently wrong.
- **“The service did not answer” and “there is nothing here” are different sentences.** Both are zero features downstream; only `available` tells them apart, and the card leads with the outage rather than reporting a clean bill of health.
- **Enclaves are cut out of the fill, because a PEB zone is a RING.** Its interior rings are exactly where the LOUDER zone begins — Roissy's zone C arrives with two, Les Mureaux's zone B with six per piece, one band at Saint-Denis de la Réunion with thirteen. Filled without them, zone C is painted over zone B and zone A and the map shows the quiet number on the loudest ground. Every ring is stroked, the interior ones included.
- **There is NO strategic noise map on the Géoplateforme, and the layer says so on every card.** Its WMS-V capabilities are 1 009 124 B and declare 915 layer names; exactly four mention bruit, and all four are DGAC aviation. The EU directive's CBS isophones exist only as ~76 per-DDT Géo-IDE ATOM shapefile zips — EPSG:2154, ISO-8859-1, no `access-control-allow-origin` header at all, four distinct HTTP-200 failure modes on the live OGC services, and Tarn shipping MapInfo TAB with no shapefile inside. That harvest is deferred; road, rail and industrial noise are absent from this layer and the cards read « avions seulement » rather than letting quiet ground beside a motorway be inferred.
- **`data.geopf.fr` rate-limits in HTML.** A 240-point grid sweep at three concurrent probes returned HTTP 429 with `content-type: text/html` and a 134-byte nginx page on 190 of 240 points; `response.json()` on that throws `Unexpected token '<'`. The proxy checks the content type before parsing, retries a 429 twice, and caches per ~11 m.
- **Three coercion defects fixed in the noise feed before it shipped.** `Number(null)` is 0, so `projectPebArretes` PLACED an aerodrome whose coordinates arrived as `[null, null]` at 0°N 0°E and made it “the nearest aerodrome with a noise plan” for the Gulf of Guinea, `projectRings` turned a null vertex into a ring point there, and `threshold(false)` returned a fabricated 0 dB. All three now type-check before parsing.
- **Antennes mobiles (ANFR) — 72 700 supports, colorés par ce qui émet vraiment.** Nouvelle couche `anfr-fr` (📡, jeton `an`, catégorie RÉSEAUX & CAPTEURS) sur l'observatoire hebdomadaire de l'Agence nationale des fréquences : 826 418 lignes de l'édition 2026-08-27 (181 988 412 octets de CSV) repliées sur 72 700 supports répartis sur 107 codes département, DOM et COM compris. Sans clé, Licence Ouverte 2.0, via le proxy `/api/anfr-fr`.
- **Un projet approuvé n'est pas un mât — et c'est 8,05 % du fichier.** Recompté le 2026-09-02 sur les `refine.statut` du portail : `En service` 639 019, `Techniquement opérationnel` 120 891, `Projet approuvé` 66 508. Replié sur les supports, **3 638 (5,00 %) n'émettent rien du tout** et sont dessinés en anneau creux, jamais comme une génération ; 15 606 supports émetteurs portent un dossier approuvé, dont **3 776 seulement ajouteraient une génération** qu'ils n'ont pas — les 11 830 autres rouvrent une bande déjà à l'antenne. Le registre se confirme lui-même : `emr_dt` est nul sur 66 321 lignes et toutes sont des projets approuvés.
- **« Techniquement opérationnel » décrit la 5G, pas un mât.** Croisement sur les 826 418 lignes : les 120 891 lignes techniquement opérationnelles sont **toutes** de la 5G, et **aucune ligne 5G de cette édition n'est jamais « en service »** ; les 639 019 lignes « en service » sont toutes 2G/3G/4G. La fiche dit quelle génération est dans quel statut, et la puce du panneau explique une fois pourquoi la réponse est toujours la même.
- **La couleur dit la génération qui émet, la taille dit les opérateurs, l'anneau dit le dossier.** Bandes mesurées sur les 72 700 supports : 5G 50 148 · 4G 18 698 · 3G 127 · 2G 89 · rien 3 638. Les deux échelons du milieu sont presque vides et c'est le constat, pas un bug : 54 757 mâts émettent de la 3G mais 54 630 émettent aussi de la 4G ou de la 5G, donc 127 mâts seulement ont la 3G pour meilleure génération. Le nuancier a donc deux ancres et non cinq échelons. Taille = opérateurs distincts : 36 671 supports en portent un, 16 786 deux, 8 230 trois, 11 012 quatre, et **exactement un en porte cinq** (SUP_ID 506104, Saint-Barthélemy).
- **Pas de choroplèthe départementale, et c'est une mesure qui le décide.** Les polygones embarqués sont les 96 départements métropolitains. La part des supports dont la meilleure génération émettrice est la 5G est presque plate en métropole — interquartile **59,7 % → 75,5 %** sur les 101 départements d'au moins 200 supports — alors que tout l'écart est outre-mer : Nouvelle-Calédonie **1,0 %**, Polynésie française 8,7 %, Martinique 28,8 %, Guadeloupe 29,8 %, contre 84,1 % dans le Val-d'Oise. Une choroplèthe métropolitaine peindrait la bande plate et perdrait les 3 822 supports où se trouve le constat. La vue nationale est donc le maillage : de vraies positions, éclaircies à 1 100 points, dans les 107 codes département.
- **Les supports se superposent, donc la couche est indexée par SUP_ID.** L'ANFR dérive ses coordonnées de degrés/minutes/**secondes entières**, soit une quantification à 1/3600° (~31 m de longitude à 48°N) : les 72 700 supports n'occupent que **71 748 positions distinctes à cinq décimales**, 895 positions sont occupées deux fois ou plus et une en porte six. Une table indexée par coordonnée perdrait 952 mâts. Le maillage, lui, ne connaît qu'une position : un clic y interroge le registre dans une boîte de ~110 m et la fiche dit combien de supports partagent le point.
- **La fiche Cartoradio, à la demande et une seule fois par mât.** Adresse, propriétaire, catégories que la couche ne dessine pas (FH, TNT, PMR), nombre d'antennes et de stations, systèmes avec leurs **paires de fréquences publiées** (la 5G NR 700 du support 449714 revient en 708–718 / 723–733 / 763–773 / 778–788 MHz, jamais additionnées en une largeur de bande que l'ANFR n'a pas publiée), et la mesure d'exposition publiée la plus proche dans 300 m avec sa distance, son laboratoire, son protocole et **sa date**. Sur le support 449714 : 33 mesures dans 300 m, la plus proche à 40 m, **0,0 V/m mesurés le 04/02/2009 sous protocole ANFR/DR 15-2.1** — un rapport sans aucune bande 5G, à côté d'un mât dont le dernier émetteur est entré en service le 18/07/2025. La fiche affiche l'avertissement plutôt que le seul chiffre.
- **Le registre DAS existe, il est réel, et il n'est pas géographique.** `das-telephonie-mobile` compte 1 230 lignes (1 150 conformes, 80 non conformes, 136 marques, prélèvements de 2012-01-03 à 2025-07-02) et **aucune coordonnée** : c'est un registre de produits, pas de lieux. Il est résumé une fois sur la charge nationale et jamais joint à un mât. Le portail se contredit sur sa taille — le catalogue D4C annonce 1 232 pour la même ressource là où le datastore en renvoie 1 230 ; la projection lit le datastore.
- **Les pièges du fichier, refusés plutôt que devinés.** Le CSV est en LF pur (zéro `\r` sur 181 988 412 octets) là où les tables 5 W voisines sont en CRLF — un analyseur écrit pour l'une laisse un retour chariot sur `statut` et transforme toute la carte en projets ; il commence par un BOM UTF-8, qui fait disparaître `id` d'un index de colonnes naïf ; `coordonnees` est en LATITUDE d'abord chez l'ANFR et en LONGITUDE d'abord dans la republication clermontoise du même schéma, donc une valeur qui ne se coupe pas sur exactement une virgule est refusée ; `sup_nm_haut` porte une virgule décimale sur 243 889 lignes et vaut `0` sur 551 supports, ce qui n'est pas une hauteur et sort en « non publiée » (médiane 30 m, 95ᵉ centile 48 m, maximum 343,3 m).
- **Collision de NOM, pas de données.** La couche `radio` de ce dépôt est radio-browser.info : des flux audio Internet identifiés par un UUID de station. Celle-ci est constituée de mâts physiques identifiés par le `SUP_ID` de l'ANFR. Elles partagent une étagère de panneau et rien d'autre : aucun champ, aucun identifiant, aucune source commune. Les deux libellés sont voisins dans le panneau exprès.
- **Hors champ par la loi, et la couche le dit.** Cité mot pour mot du jeu de données : *« Installations radioélectriques de plus de 5 watts, hormis celles de l'Aviation Civile et des ministères de la Défense et de l'Intérieur. »* Un vide au-dessus d'une base ou d'un aéroport est une politique publique, pas un trou de données.
- **🌳 Îlots de fraîcheur (Paris) — a new keyless ODbL layer over four Ville de Paris / Eau de Paris registers.** 535 cool spots as points, 984 cool green spaces as real footprints (584 Polygon + 400 MultiPolygon, 219 832 published vertices), 1 323 drinking fountains, and the 219 432 trees of the city loaded per viewport. Two regimes and the split is by SIZE, not by zoom: the three refuge registers fold server-side into one 643 107 B gzipped document and ship whole, the trees cannot (111 MB decoded for the whole file) and are a bbox query.
- **Only 23 of the 984 cool green spaces stay open during a heatwave, and the layer draws all 23 in their own hot stroke.** Verified directly — `where=canicule_ouverture="Oui"` answers `{"total_count": 23}` — because the cross-facet returns three `Oui` rows, (Oui,null)=3, (Oui,Non)=11, (Oui,Oui)=9, and adding two of the three gives the 20 an earlier reading of this dataset reported. Nine are also 24 h. **Eleven of the twenty-three publish `indice_veget_sup8m_2024 = 0`** — no measured vegetation over 8 m at all — with a median canopy share of 0,0280 against 0,3197 across all 983 spaces carrying the metric; eight of those eleven are `categorie: "Jardiniere"`, five of them on the Porte Maillot roundabout.
- **The equipment register is coloured by mechanism, not by building type, because the building types ARE the finding.** 127 ombrières pérennes, 125 lieux de culte, 87 brumisateurs, 65 musées, 39 piscines, 19 mairies d'arrondissement, 17 bains-douches, 16 bibliothèques, 13 terrains de boules, 12 ombrières temporaires, 11 baignades extérieures, 4 découverte et initiation. 225 of the 535 are cold stone you go inside — the biggest family and the one nobody guesses — and the five families (pierre, ombre, brume, bain, plein air) name why each thing is on a heat list.
- **Green spaces are coloured by a measured canopy metric, not by area.** `indice_veget_sup8m_2024` is the share of ground under vegetation taller than 8 m at the 2024 survey; seven fixed bands on the measured distribution (p25 0,1083, p50 0,3197, p75 0,5366), with `= 0` its own band (66 spaces) and `null` grey (1 space) because “nothing was found here” and “nobody looked” are different statements. The register also publishes `p_vegetation_h`, a DIFFERENT number on 903 of the 953 rows carrying both (SQUARE D'ANVERS: 0,10921619 against 0,12799286); the card prints both and calls neither a correction. Total measured canopy: 8 734 377 m², of which the two bois hold 6 159 289 m².
- **682 of the 984 green spaces publish opening hours whose own validity window had already expired**, 638 of them the same `du 01/05/26 au 31/08/26`, in a file last modified 2026-08-28. The window is printed on the SAME line as the open/closed answer on every card, never in a footnote. 214 spaces and 423 cool spots publish no readable weekday hours at all and are reported as *unknown*, never as *closed*.
- **“Open right now” is recomputed in the browser, on Europe/Paris, every minute.** The proxy caches its fold for an hour and its summary is unusable for this question: measured over the real registers, 757 green spaces and 93 cool spots are open at 14 h 00 Paris against 367 and 0 at 01 h 30. The local re-fold costs 5,0 ms over the whole pack. The zone is `Europe/Paris` and not the browser's, because an operator in Denver would otherwise be shown a Paris park as open eight hours after it shut.
- **The tree half is a viewport query with a 36-byte gate.** `exports/geojson` honours `where=in_bbox(geo_point_2d,…)` and is subject to neither cap `records` carries — 100 rows a page, and `offset + limit <= 10000` with *“Invalid value for sum of offset + limit API parameter: 10099 was found but <= 10000 is expected.”* Before any download, `records?…&limit=0&select=count(*) as n` answers the box's population in 36 B and 99 ms; over budget nothing is fetched and the true count is printed. Measured: 5 287 trees for 1 690 170 B decoded on a central box; 10 571 trees for 3 368 281 B on the densest box in Paris.
- **The tree budget is 12 500, set on the widest box the PROXY accepts rather than the widest the client asks for.** Every grid-aligned window was scored over all 219 432 published coordinates (downloaded through `exports/json?select=geo_point_2d`, 15 737 120 B): the densest 0,020° window holds **10 571** trees at 48.816,2.346 → 48.836,2.366 — the 13e — confirmed against the portal's own count probe, and the densest 0,022° one holds 12 269. A budget set at 10 000 would have refused the arrondissement with the most trees in it.
- **A tree height of 0 means “not surveyed”, and 19 407 of the 219 432 trees carry it** (with `circonferenceencm = 0` on 16 250; 16 123 carry both). Those dots take their own grey and the minimum size and are never scaled. The size ceiling is 25 m, the 99th percentile of the 200 025 published heights, not the 65 m maximum that exactly two trees reach. `remarquable` is three-state — NON 205 726, null 13 523, OUI 183 — and the null is not a no. `stadedeveloppement` carries `"Jeune (arbre)Adulte"`, two states concatenated upstream, on 41 526 trees (18,9 %), labelled as unreadable rather than mapped to either.
- **One palette across three modules, and grey means exactly one thing.** Grey `#8a93a6` is reserved for “the register did not measure this” — the space with no canopy index, the 19 407 trees with no surveyed height, and any fountain that stops publishing `dispo` — and no other channel may take it. Two collisions were caught and fixed on the way in: the measured-tree band was exactly `#2f8b43`, which is the canopy ramp's 40–55 % fill, so a measured tree standing on any of those 164 parks was painted in its own background; and the residual equipment family was amber, which the 183 remarkable trees own. A test now forbids both.
- **Nothing is placed that was not published.** All 535 equipment rows, all 1 323 fountains and all 219 432 trees carry a real coordinate; 984 of 984 green spaces keep at least one usable ring, and the 22 rings (of 3 439) that fall below a triangle at one metre are dropped and counted. Coordinates are rounded to 5 decimal places — 0,73 m of longitude at 48,86° N — which alone takes 219 832 published vertices to 127 465, because 42,0 % of them were duplicates of their neighbour once 16 decimal places of noise came off. No stride, no Douglas-Peucker: a park's outline is its published outline, moved by at most a metre.
- **`identifiant` is a key on neither refuge register, and `count(distinct)` on this portal lies.** 533 distinct identifiers over 535 equipment rows and 955 over 984 green spaces, 24 of which publish none at all; render ids carry the published key AND the geometry, and every reuse is counted onto the row. Separately, `count(distinct idbase)` answers 211 523 for a 219 432-row register — a HyperLogLog approximation — while `exports/json?select=idbase` settles it at 219 432 distinct, 0 duplicates.
- **Délinquance enregistrée (FR) — the SSMSI's recorded-crime bases, drawn with the publisher's caution rather than around it.** 34,920 communes, 101 départements, 18 indicators at département grain and 15 at commune grain, 2016–2025, keyless under Licence Ouverte 2.0. Two regimes: a 96-polygon département choropleth on `taux_pour_mille`, and per-département commune packs below a 0.75° view span.
- **Fixed a false gloss of the suppression rule that a card was printing to readers.** The layer described a withheld cell as « entre 1 et 5 faits ». The rule (« Les données diffusées sont limitées aux communes pour lesquelles plus de 5 faits ont été enregistrés pendant 3 années successives ») is a three-year condition on the series, not a ceiling on the displayed year, and the register refutes the gloss: measured 2026-09-02, **4,735 of the 251,145 withheld 2025 cells belong to a (commune, indicateur) pair that published more than 5 facts in 2023 or 2024** — Cessy (01071) published 16 *Vols de véhicule* in 2023 — and **36 (département, indicateur) pairs carry a withheld-commune mean above 5**, topping out at 22.33 in Seine-Saint-Denis. Every surface now quotes the SSMSI verbatim.
- **Fixed a dead branch in `delinquanceCellState` that made the whole three-state model accidental.** The register quotes its fields, so the flag arrives as `"ndiff"` with the quotes attached and a bare `String()` comparison never matched. Classification was falling through to the numeric branch and landing on the right answer only because a withheld row also carries `nombre = NA`; an edition that ever wrote a number beside a `ndiff` flag would have painted a withheld commune as measured.
- **`formatDelinquanceRate(null)` printed « 0,000 ».** `Number(null)` is 0, so an absent rate formatted as a measured zero — the exact sentence the three-state model exists to prevent. It now returns an em dash, while a genuine published zero (Ardèche recorded no homicide in 2025) still formats as `0,000`.
- **A withheld cell is not a zero and is not a low value, and 63 tests now hold that line.** A withheld cell takes no colour from the six-band ramp for any bin index including bogus ones, contributes to no quantile threshold, is never averaged, arrives on the wire as a bare `[state]` with no number to paint, and appears in the legend under its own name with its own count. The national withheld count reaches the row legend even at département zoom, where nothing is withheld and the map otherwise looks complete.
- **The quantile cut is taken on faits per MILLION, because the shared `countBins` rounds to integers.** Measured over the 96 metropolitan polygons on the 2025 edition, `Cambriolages de logement`: the real quantiles are 3.641, 4.769, 5.491, 5.926 and 6.569 per 1,000 dwellings and `countBins` on the raw rates returns **[4, 5, 6, 7, 8]**, moving the top boundary from 6.57 to 8.00. On `Homicides` the 93 real quantiles run 0.0071 to 0.0178 and it returns **[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]**, putting every département in band 0.
- **Rate, not count, and the Cher is the whole argument.** On the 2025 cambriolages, by count the leaders are Bouches-du-Rhône 8,586, Nord 8,501, Rhône 7,153 and Paris 7,072, and the eight biggest hold 55,198 of 211,596 facts (26.1%) — very nearly a list of the eight biggest départements. By rate per 1,000 dwellings the leaders are Guyane 9.80, **Cher 9.28**, Ain 8.67 and Isère 8.36, and the Nord drops from 2nd to 17th.
- **Real SSMSI rows, captured through the exact URLs the proxy builds.** `ssmsi-communes-sample.csv` (300 rows, 18 communes) and `ssmsi-departements-sample.csv` (504 rows, 14 départements) plus the geo.api.gouv.fr contours for Paris and five Haute-Corse communes and the trimmed data.gouv.fr dataset payload. Every row is a distinct trap: the withheld-but-not-small commune, the all-fifteen-withheld commune, the zero-population village détruit whose published zero carries a `NA` rate, the Paris arrondissement withheld to block subtraction, the Marseille arrondissements whose departmental mean is 11.0, the 2,897-vertex outline, the five-part island commune, and the enclave ring.

- **Comptages routiers (Paris) — the first road layer here that has counted a
  vehicle.** `traffic` is TomTom flow, bring-your-own-key, and its own header
  says a keyless build runs a SIMULATION; `road-status-fr` is DATEX incident
  reporting whose own header says Île-de-France has no publisher at all. Neither
  has ever counted a car inside Paris. This draws `q` — whose field description
  is verbatim *"Débit (nombre de véhicules comptés pendant l'heure)"* — from the
  city's own permanent loops, on the arc that measured it. **2,977 arcs, 500,136
  hourly readings**, folded from a dataset of **27,772,889**.
- **It is J-2, and the word "live" appears nowhere in it.** Measured
  2026-09-01T21:02Z: `data_processed` 2026-09-01T01:02:50Z, cadence
  *Quotidienne*, granularity *Horaire*, and `max(t_1h)` 2026-08-30T22:00:00Z —
  a nightly batch ~46 h behind the wall clock. So the unit is not a moment but
  the last COMPLETE local Monday–Sunday week, **discovered** from the data's own
  newest hour and floored at the week this was measured against. A discovery
  older than the floor is a malformed answer, not a new fact. `comptagesWeekLabel`
  is asserted to contain no clock time and no claim of liveness.
- **891 of the 2,977 arcs measured nothing, and they are drawn as silence.** The
  live build reports 1,730 arcs counting vehicles, 356 publishing occupancy but
  no count, and 891 publishing neither in any of the 168 hours — with the city's
  own `etat_barre` explaining them as 724 *Invalide*, 141 *Ouvert* and 26
  *Barré*, so 141 arcs are declared open and still silent. A silent arc gets
  `bin: null` and a colour that is **not a member of the flow ramp**; giving it
  the ramp's quietest step would assert a measurement on 891 real streets.
- **A null bin no longer prints as "< 100 véh/h".** `comptagesFlowBandLabel()`
  guarded with `Number(bin)`, and `Number(null)`, `Number('')`, `Number(false)`
  and `Number([])` are all `0` — so an unmeasured arc rendered as the bottom
  band on the legend and the card. It now guards on `typeof bin !== 'number'`.
  This is the exact conflation the module header forbids, reaching a user-facing
  surface; `comptagesFlowBin()` had always refused it.
- **The geometry comes from the measurement, not from the referential.**
  `referentiel-comptages-routiers` publishes **3,739 rows for only 3,348
  distinct `iu_ac`** — 338 repeated with no usable tiebreak, `date_fin` maxing
  at 2023-01-01 on 3,303 arcs that are demonstrably still counting in 2026 —
  and it misses 31 arcs that ARE counting while carrying 402 that are not. The
  counts export carries `geo_shape` on every row: 2,977 features for 2,977 ids,
  fresher, and 0.27 s against 7.7 s. The referential is never fetched.
- **31 arcs publish no geometry and 19 of them are measuring.** They are counted
  on the card and named in the loading line rather than dropped or pinned to a
  street they might not be on.
- **Ten upstream calls, folded once, in 3.1 s.** One `max(t_1h)`, one GeoJSON
  export pinned to the week's closing hour, eight grouped aggregations (the
  clock six hours at a time, because the grouped endpoint caps `offset + limit`
  at 30,000 and one day-type is 71,448 cells), and one `etat_barre` roll-up
  whose loss is explicitly not fatal. Payload 1,374,165 B raw, **305,250 B
  gzipped**. Cached six hours in memory, a fortnight on disk under
  `.gev-cache/comptages-fr/`.
- Share token `cr`, panel icon 🚦 — deliberately neither `traffic`'s 🚗 nor
  `road-status-fr`'s 🛣, because the whole point is that it is a different
  quantity. `REGISTERED_LAYER_IDS.length` moves 42 → 43.

- **Pouls vélo (FR) — une semaine type à Lyon et à Paris, et pourquoi les deux
  ne se dessinent pas pareil.** The globe already showed Vélib' and Vélo'v as
  they are *right now*. This shows how they are *usually*: 168 hours of a
  typical week, from the two cities' own archives.

  **The finding is the layer.** The Métropole de Lyon publishes the availability
  of every Vélo'v station continuously since 2023-03-27 — filterable per station
  and per date, the only archive of its kind in France. **Paris publishes no
  Vélib' equivalent at all.** Checked four ways on 2026-09-02: opendata.paris.fr
  carries two Vélib' datasets and both are real-time only; data.gouv.fr has no
  availability history; transport.data.gouv.fr's `history` array for the Vélib'
  dataset is empty; and `lovasoa/historique-velib-opendata`, the community
  mirror everyone cites, was last pushed 2023-04-04 with release assets dated
  2021.

  So the two cities answer through different instruments, and the layer says so
  on every card instead of quietly averaging them:

  - **Lyon — STOCKS.** How full each of 422 docks is. A station that empties
    every weekday morning and refills every evening is a commuter origin; the
    reverse is a destination.
  - **Paris — FLOWS.** How many cyclists pass each of 111 permanent counters.
    People going by, not bicycles standing still.

  Nothing puts the two on one scale. What is compared is each site against
  **itself** — its share of its own weekly maximum — which means the same thing
  in both cities while the height keeps each city's own unit.

  **Three ways to look at it.** MAINTENANT shows the hour of the week it
  currently is, so a reader opening the globe on a Tuesday morning sees a
  Tuesday morning. SEMAINE runs all 168 hours in 37 seconds — the morning peak
  fills, the city drains, the weekend flattens. POINTE freezes on the network's
  busiest hour.

  **Two traps the build had to survive, both measured.** Paris timestamps are
  UTC and a typical week is local: grouping without `timezone=Europe/Paris`
  puts the morning peak at 04:00, and counter 100003096's 04:00 bucket reads 38
  without the timezone and 4 with it. And Lyon's archive does not write every
  station every minute — a 5-minute window returned 332 of 454 stations in one
  probe — so the build samples five minutes per hour and leans on four weeks to
  fill the gaps, records how many of the four landed in each slot, and **drops
  and counts** a station sampled in fewer than half the week's hours rather than
  drawing it with holes in it. A CLOSED station is skipped rather than averaged
  in as 0 %: a maintenance outage is not an empty dock.

  **One fixed window, both cities: four weeks of June 2026.** A typical week in
  June is not a typical week in January, and averaging thirteen months would
  hide that rather than solve it. It is stated in the pack, on the row and on
  every card. Cost: 672 requests and ~215 MB for Lyon, paced at 300 ms; 113
  server-side aggregations and about a megabyte for Paris.

- **Fiche implantation (FR) — le chiffre qu'un outil de géomarketing vend, avec
  sa barre d'erreur.** Click a door: how many people live within ten minutes'
  walk of it, what do they earn, what may be built on the plot, what did the
  ground around it last sell for. Every half of that was already on this globe —
  the reachable shape, the INSEE carroyage, the PLU, DVF — and nothing had ever
  joined them. The join is the product.

  **The headline is a bracket, not a number.** A 200 m carreau sits inside the
  ring, outside it, or across its edge. Every commercial tool picks a convention
  and prints one figure; this one prints the centroid count between two
  countable bounds — the population of the squares entirely inside, and of every
  square the ring touches. Measured at place Bellecour, ten minutes on foot:
  **9 703 habitants, entre 5 643 et 15 694** on 0,96 km². Place de la
  République: **28 878, entre 21 988 et 50 074** on 0,95 km².

  **That bracket is wide because the grid is coarse relative to the question,
  and the card says so out loud.** A ten-minute walk is about 1,1 km across and
  a carreau is 200 m, so most of the squares the ring touches ARE its border —
  24 of 35 at Bellecour. Without that sentence a reader meeting a ±100 % bracket
  assumes a bug rather than a resolution. And the four counts are printed as a
  partition that adds up: retenus au centre, touchés, entiers, à cheval.

  It never scales a square by the fraction of it inside the ring. That is areal
  interpolation, it assumes people are spread evenly across a square, and
  INSEE's own imputation flag exists precisely because they are not.

  **No new proxy.** The layer fans out across four routes this server already
  has — all cached, all tested — through the shared address-scan factory's
  `fetchImpl` seam, and joins them in the browser. A fifth route would have
  duplicated their load logic server-side and missed their caches. One source
  going quiet degrades the fiche rather than killing it, and the card names
  which one.

  Share token `im`, carrying the duration: "9 703 habitants" at ten minutes and
  at fifteen are two different claims about the same door. `npm run
  qa:implantation` proves it in a browser over Lyon and Paris — and it asserts
  on the WORDS, because this is the one layer whose product is a sentence.

- **Zone de chalandise (FR) — le service isochrone avait un proxy et aucune
  surface.** `/api/isochrone` has been in this repository since 2026-09-01,
  wired, cached, unit-tested — and drawn by nothing. It is now a layer.

  **A circle at 800 m is a lie a map tells.** It crosses railways, rivers and
  motorways as if they were pavement. IGN runs Valhalla over its own BD TOPO
  road and path network and answers the polygon actually reachable, and the
  difference is the entire product: from place Bellecour, a fifteen-minute walk
  is **2,19 km²** and stops dead at the Rhône and the Saône except where a
  bridge crosses; the same doorstep by car reaches **32,41 km²**.

  Three nested rings — 5, 10, 15 minutes — in one request. The route now takes a
  comma list and fetches the rings **one at a time** upstream: the Géoplateforme
  publishes 5 requests per second per IP with no SLA and an explicit right to
  cut a client off, and three parallel rings per scan across a deployed
  instance's visitors is the traffic shape that closes an open service. A ring
  that fails is dropped rather than zeroed, and the layer says how many are
  missing — a smaller catchment area drawn with full confidence is the one way
  this layer could quietly mislead.

  **Two numbers no competitor's map carries.** Each ring reports the radius of
  the circle with the SAME AREA — the honest version of the number a reader was
  going to use anyway, printed immediately before "mais ce n'est pas un cercle".
  And between consecutive rings, the **expansion**: in open ground a reachable
  area grows with the square of time, so doubling the budget quadruples it, and
  every shortfall is the network. The measured growth against that ×4 needs no
  assumed walking speed and no model — it is two measured areas divided by each
  other. Bellecour's outer band reads 107 %, place de la République 104,5 %: two
  cities that open up past the first block, and the number would say so just as
  clearly if they did not.

  **There is no cycling ring, and the chip says why.** The service accepts
  `pedestrian` and `car` and rejects `bicycle` with HTTP 400. So VÉLO is drawn
  as a **disabled chip carrying that reason**, `setParams` refuses the value
  even from a hand-edited share link, and the codec cannot encode it at all — a
  link must not be able to carry a state the service cannot produce. Mapping
  bike onto pedestrian would have drawn a walking ring and labelled it cycling.

  The layer's own altitude ceiling is 8 km rather than the shared 12 km, because
  a 2 km² ring seen from 12 km up is a smudge, and a smudge that looks like an
  answer is worse than none. A clamped outline answers `scene.pick` with null,
  so each ring plants one label — the only reachable card path — and the centre
  carries the summary. Share token `is`, carrying the mode. `npm run
  qa:isochrone` proves it in a browser over Lyon and Paris.

- **Carroyage INSEE (FR) — qui habite là, en carrés de 200 mètres.** The globe
  already drew everything France has BUILT — the buildings, the schools, the
  doctors, what sold, what the PLU allows — and nothing about who lives in it.
  A commune average cannot answer that: Lyon 7e is one code covering both the
  Guillotière and Gerland. This is INSEE's Filosofi carroyage, **2 314 836
  squares of 200 m** and **377 234 of 1 km** over métropole, Martinique and La
  Réunion, extruded on the globe for the viewport you are looking at.

  **Colour is the indicator; height is the count it was computed on.** That is
  the layer's one real design decision and it is a correctness one: a stack of
  "27 100 € par personne" has no volume, and the eye reads volume as quantity.
  A block whose volume is its population is a true statement — so switching
  between the eight indicators recolours the city without relaying it, and a
  brilliantly coloured square one pixel tall is four households and reads as
  one. Every card says so in words, because it cannot be read off the picture.

  **The bands are national and absolute, and they were measured.** There is no
  scale to borrow — INSEE publishes deciles of niveau de vie per PERSON, and a
  carreau carries a mean over its inhabitants, a much narrower distribution.
  `npm run filosofi:ramp` samples 42 boxes across urban, peri-urban, rural and
  overseas France — **80 105 carreaux, 12 285 745 habitants** — and takes the
  population-weighted quantiles, weighted because a 6-person square in the
  Cantal and a 2 818-person square in Paris 19e answer for very different
  numbers of people. A colour therefore means the same thing in Neuilly and in
  Roubaix, which is the whole point of drawing it.

  **Two cells in five are modelled, not observed** — 31 351 of the 80 105
  sampled carry INSEE's `i_car_est`, meaning the figures were imputed because
  publishing the observation would have breached statistical confidentiality.
  They are drawn as a smaller square inside their own footprint, so the grid is
  visibly perforated where the data is inferred, and the card names it.

  **No geometry crosses the wire.** Each cell is named
  `CRS3035RES200mN2529400E3919200` — its own south-west corner in EPSG:3035 —
  so inverting that projection rebuilds the exact polygon the service would
  have sent, verified against captured fixtures to eight decimals. A Lyon
  viewport costs **311 KB instead of 1.63 MB**. The two grids do not share
  their column names (`i_car_est` against `i_est_1km`, and no commune at all at
  1 km), and asking one for the other's column is an HTTP 400 rather than an
  empty column.

  The layer refuses a view wider than 0.9° instead of drawing a sample of the
  country that would look like a picture of it, and flies the camera in. Share
  token `fi`, and the link carries the chosen indicator: the same squares
  coloured by wealth and by poverty are two different maps, and a link that
  dropped the choice would restore the wrong one. Keyless, Licence Ouverte 2.0,
  30-day disk cache. `npm run qa:filosofi` proves it in a browser over Lyon and
  Paris.

- **Stations météo (FR) — where France measures the weather, and what each
  instrument can actually tell you.** All **2 144 stations** of Météo-France's
  real-time observation network, from the tide line to the **Aiguille du Midi at
  3 845 m**. The globe already showed the weather three times — Open-Meteo in the
  cockpit, Vigilance météo per département, Vigicrues on the rivers — and never
  once showed where the numbers come from. A vigilance map is an interpretation
  of readings taken somewhere; this is the somewhere.
- **Colour is capability, because a French weather station usually is not one.**
  A reader expects 2 144 identical instruments knowing temperature, wind,
  pressure and humidity. Against Météo-France's own per-station inventory:
  **1 254 of the 2 144 — 58 % — measure temperature and rain and nothing else**,
  only **845 can tell you which way the wind is blowing**, and only **234** have
  a barometer. **228** measure all five. So the palette is what each dot can
  answer, the disc is sized by how many of the fourteen instrument families it
  carries, and the **VENT** chip deletes 60 % of the map on purpose.
- **190 stations publish their readings in the open — and Météo-France's own
  list names 62.** A ring means a station whose last hour is readable without a
  key, and clicking one fetches it: temperature, wind and gust in km/h, pressure,
  humidity, rain, visibility, snow. Boulogne-sur-Mer, Le Touquet, Dunkerque,
  Dieppe, Beauvais-Tillé, Ouessant-Stiff and 123 others publish hourly without
  appearing on the list that is supposed to name them; **CAP CEPET is on the list
  and has written nothing all year**. The layer counts the archive, never the
  list. The other 1 954 stations are measuring right now and publishing nothing
  a visitor can read — the card says that, rather than showing an empty reading.
- **Every station's records, with the window they stand in.** 1 230 postes
  publish a *fiche climatologique*, and a click brings back the hottest and
  coldest day ever recorded there plus the period the record was established
  over — Toulouse-Blagnac's 42,4 °C in 2023 against observations back to 1947,
  Arbent's 39,2 °C against 2004. The window is printed with the number because
  without it the two read the same.
- **The instrument inventory, joined from a 191 MB file no browser can fetch.**
  The station list is eight columns and says nothing about what anything
  measures; that lives in Météo-France's per-parameter inventory, dated one
  instrument at a time. `npm run meteo:stations` joins four of the publisher's
  files into a 644 KB pack. Families are anchored on hourly base readings, never
  keyword-matched: matching on "VENT" would count a decadal wind average —
  present on 879 stations — as an anemometer when only 845 have one.
- **Seven stations in the live list are closed, and six exist in no metadata at
  all.** MARSILLARGUES since 2026-01-01, DESHAIES GENDARMERIE since 2024-10-01,
  ST JOSEPH-CIRAD and TAN ROUGE-CIRAD since 2023-03-29, and three more —
  Météo-France's own metadata records the closure and its own real-time list
  still carries the station. They are drawn hollow and the card leads with the
  date. ALBA LA ROMAINE, SOULAINES, TARASCON, PIOGGIOLA, QUERCITELLO and MURAT
  SUR VEBRE are drawn in the neutral grey this project uses for "the publisher
  did not say" — never as stations that measure nothing.
- **Urbanisme (PLU) — click anywhere on the map, not on the marker.** The layer
  drew a whole block of zoning and put every word of the answer on one 26-pixel
  glyph, so the plot opposite could be SEEN and not READ: knowing what the
  magenta polygon across the street means meant flying the camera over it.
  A click on the wash, on an outline, or on the bare globe between them now
  opens a card for that spot — which zone, what the family means, which
  easements reach it, when the PLU was approved and under which document.
  Measured at Ustaritz at 900 m: four clicks across one screen answer `UB`,
  `UA`, `A` and `UB`. No request and no wait: the answer is read out of the map
  already in hand. The scan marker keeps its own card, which is the scan-level
  summary.
- **The register outranks the drawing, within 30 m of the marker.** The shapes
  on screen are decimated by up to 96%, and this layer's own rule is that a
  simplified outline must never decide which rule applies to a house: measured
  at Ustaritz, the point APIcarto itself answers `UB` for falls OUTSIDE the
  drawn `UB` ring — 571 sampled points do. At the scan point the register has
  already answered, so it is used and the geometry is not consulted; further
  out the drawn map answers and the card says its outlines are simplified.
- **Four ways to have no zoning, said apart.** The answer was refused whole,
  the box never covered this spot, the camera is above 1 500 m so only the
  marker was asked about, or the published document genuinely stops here.
  A card printing "aucun zonage" for all four would report three of the layer's
  own limits as facts about the plot. Easements the same: "aucune servitude à
  ce point" only where the register answered that point, and "aucune des N
  servitudes du repère n'atteint ce point" everywhere else — because "this
  ground is clear" is a survey, and the easement half is only ever asked at the
  marker.
- **An approval date is a date.** The same national schema publishes `datvalid`
  as `20240323` at Ustaritz and `2026-06-16` in Paris; both now read
  `23/03/2024` and `16/06/2026` on every card.
- **Accueil du jeune enfant (FR) — the indicator, because the register does not
  exist.** The question "can we add a crèche dataset?" was answered by
  measurement, not assumption, and the answer is no: the Cnaf publishes 210
  open datasets and **not one is an establishment**; FINESS holds 174 621
  establishments of which only **183** have a crèche-shaped name, and those are
  incidental (EAJE are authorised by the département's PMI, not an ARS);
  INSEE's BPE has the right object but its only API millésimes are 2016 and
  **2021**; and Sirene's NAF 88.91A silently drops the entire public sector —
  `nature_juridique` 7210 with that APE returns **zero rows**, while a
  municipal crèche is really there as an establishment of the commune's SIREN.
  So the new layer draws what the State does publish: **places of formal
  childcare per 100 children under three**, at the three scales the Cnaf
  publishes them — 102 départements, 1 251 EPCI, 1 061 communes.
- **The colour is a ratio to France, not a quantile.** This layer paints three
  nested scales, and a quantile band means "the top sixth of what is on
  screen" — so the same colour would mean different things at different zooms
  and an area would change colour without anything changing about it. Every
  scale is anchored on the one national figure (**60,9** in 2023, which
  cross-checks exactly against the ONAPE 2024 report), on a diverging ramp
  whose break falls where the ratio crosses 1. The map then says something
  immediately: the Atlantic west is well above France, the Paris ring and the
  Mediterranean south well below.
- **The omission is the finding.** The bundled polygons are metropolitan, so 6
  of the Cnaf's 102 rows cannot be painted — Guyane 13,4, Saint-Martin 30,2,
  La Réunion 38,5, Guadeloupe 44,1, Saint-Barthélemy 47,5, Martinique 55,2.
  **Every one is below the national rate, Guyane at 22% of it**, while not one
  metropolitan département reaches the lowest band. A map stopping at the
  coastline would delete the whole bottom of the distribution, so the six are
  carried with their rates and named on the national card.
- **Two placeholder rows that are not spelled alike.** The EPCI file publishes
  `numepci = "XX"` carrying a real and extreme 195,8 — the national maximum,
  drawn nowhere, anchoring any ramp — and the département places file spells
  the same idea `XXX`. Matching a literal would have caught one of the two.
  With it gone the real EPCI range is 2,7 to 160,5.
- **Médecins (FR) — where doctors are, and where access runs out.** 64 232
  practice addresses, 117 922 named doctors and what each of them charges,
  drawn at three scales. The national view paints the DREES's **accessibilité
  potentielle localisée** rather than a headcount, and that is a measured
  choice: the median French person lives **0.7 km from a general practitioner**
  and only 0.49 % of the population is beyond 10 km, so a map of counts would
  say "France is covered" and be useless. What is scarce is capacity — 18 % of
  the population lives in a commune the ARS class as under-served. Closer in,
  colour is the family of medicine and dot size is the number of distinct
  doctors at the address; a click names them, says what each costs (94 % of GP
  entries are secteur 1 against 18 % of ophthalmologists, 63 % of whom set
  their own fees), places the commune in the national tenth, and shows what
  the neighbourhood loses when its over-62s retire — **−22 % nationally**.
- **The register that publishes no coordinates, geocoded.** The CNAM's
  *Annuaire santé Ameli* is the only nationwide list of conventioned doctors
  and it contains **not one latitude**: its address block is named
  `coordonnees_*` in the sense of *contact details*. Every ready-geocoded copy
  in circulation descends from the previous CNAM directory, deprecated in
  December 2025, and still speaks of the *contrat d'accès aux soins* — closed
  to new signatures on 2016-12-31. The one daily-geocoded national register,
  Atlasanté's, answers HTTP 403 outside the ARS network. So
  `npm run medecins:registry` geocodes the register against the Base Adresse
  Nationale in three passes and ships the result: **64 232 of 64 625 addresses
  placed, 99.4 %**, 82.7 % at the exact door, 1.1 % at a commune centre that
  says so on its card, and 393 named rather than quietly dropped.
- **Checked against the CNAM's own headcount, and it holds.** The same
  publisher counts the same population a second way; `--verifier` replays the
  comparison. **117 922 named doctors against 112 159**, +5.1 % — the gap a
  directory should show over an activity count taken two years earlier — with
  23 professions between −1.5 % and +15.1 %, and per DÉPARTEMENT a median gap
  of **+2.1 %, 97 of 101 inside [−10 %, +15 %]**, so the geocoding moved nobody
  between departments. Three register traps are neutralised on the way: a
  radiologist is listed at every imaging site they cover (5.53 entries per name
  against 1.18 for a GP), three separate codes read `Médecin généraliste`
  (grouping by code loses 11 % of them), and 9 328 doctors practise in more
  than one département (summing per-department distinct names answers 130 330
  for a country holding 117 922).

- **Urbanisme (PLU) — it draws the block now, not the dot.** The layer answered
  one point, which is the wrong question: "could the car park opposite become
  twenty-five metres of construction?" is about the plot OPPOSITE. Below
  1 500 m the zoning half is asked for over a BOX around what the camera is
  looking at — clipped to the view, so nothing off screen is fetched — and each
  zone is drawn in its family's colour with **its code written on the ground**,
  the way the paper document does it. Above 1 500 m it falls back to the point
  answer, which is still correct and much cheaper. The enclaves that were blank
  islands are now named: the school reads `UE`, the industrial estate `UYc`.
- **The servitude half stays a point, and the measurement is why.** One 390 m
  box over Lyon's Presqu'île answers **210 easement features and 2.3 MB**. At
  the zoning ceiling a full-box regime cost 4 MB upstream, 1.8 MB on the wire
  and 1 182 entities, against the hybrid's 888 KB, 506 KB and 218 — four times
  the payload for the half of the answer a point already gets right.
- **It costs bytes, not frames.** Measured in the browser on the shipped build,
  both regimes, IGN ortho: median frame **0.6–1.4 ms**, worst frame after a
  redraw **1.4–2.2 ms**, and **zero frames over 16 ms** in either. Cesium
  batches ground fills by material and there are only eight zone colours.
  Upstream, the box costs +13% to +27% in a city (the easements already
  dominate) and 17× in a rural commune, where the point answer was 30 KB.
- **`zone-urba` truncates at 5 000 features, HTTP 200, silently — same trap as
  the cadastre.** Measured 2026-09-01: a 0.15° box over Paris returns 4 105 of
  4 105 whole; a 0.40° box returns **5 000 of 17 182**, and a 1.0°
  Île-de-France box **5 000 of 46 500**. A zoning map missing four fifths of
  itself is not visibly incomplete — it looks like a commune with genuinely
  mixed zoning — so a box over the ceiling is refused whole and the true count
  printed. At the layer's own 0.02° ceiling the densest measured box answers 55
  zones, so the refusal is the exception.
- **A label that might sit outside its own zone would be worse than no label.**
  Anchors are the midpoint of the longest interior chord, not the centroid: a
  PLU zone is routinely a meander along a village street or a ring around a
  hamlet, and the centroid of either lands on ground the rule does not cover.
  Verified against all 55 zones of a real answer — every anchor inside its own
  drawn shape. A zone too narrow to hold text is drawn and coloured but
  unlabelled; its card still names it.
- **Which zone you are standing in is decided by whoever was asked.** Under a
  point query APIcarto has already answered it, and re-deciding can only
  disagree; under a box query the layer decides, against the ring as PUBLISHED
  rather than the one it draws. That is not academic: Ustaritz's `UB` ring is
  521 vertices, decimated to 400 for drawing, and the coordinate APIcarto
  itself answers `UB` for falls OUTSIDE the decimated ring. The drawn shape is
  a simplification and must never decide which rule applies to a house.
- The card separates the block from the address: the zone under the marker, how
  many others are on screen, and — when two communes disagree at their shared
  limit — that several zonings claim the same ground. A neighbouring zone's own
  card says it is a neighbour.
- A scan now refetches when the QUESTION changes, not only when the scan centre
  moves 250 m. Zooming straight down through the box altitude moves the centre
  by nothing at all while changing the kind of answer that belongs on screen.
- `viewportBox.focusedViewBox` and a new `ringGeometry.js` hold the box
  derivation and the point-in-polygon the cadastre layer had already paid for;
  the cadastre keeps its own names and ceilings and delegates the arithmetic.

- **Urbanisme (PLU) — the zone is now a wash on the ground, with its enclaves
  cut out of it.** The layer drew bare outlines, and an operator asked the
  right question of them: how can one house be in two PLU zones at once? An
  outline has no inside. Nothing on screen said which side of a line the rule
  applied to, and a building between two lines belonged to both as far as the
  eye could tell. Each zone is now filled — ground-classified, so it drapes on
  IGN ortho, on Bing and on the photoreal tileset alike — with the stroke kept
  on top: the wash says where, the stroke says exactly where.
- **The enclaves were ours, and they are fixed.** The projection kept outer
  rings only, on the reasoning that a hole in an outline is invisible. It is —
  and it is the whole point of a fill. Measured at Ustaritz on 2026-09-01, the
  zone returned for the village centre is `UB`, one polygon, **two interior
  rings**: 6 646 m² the same PLU zones `UE` (the school) and 50 686 m² it
  zones `UYc` (the industrial estate). Filled without them, `UB` painted
  57 332 m² of ground with a rule that does not reach it — and across the
  commune, 14 rings and 299 441 m². Interior rings are now carried, spent out
  of the vertex budget *with* the ring they perforate so a hole can never be
  what a budget drops, and stroked in their own right.
- **A point really can be in two zones, and the layer now says so.** Sampled
  on a 35 m grid over a 9 × 6 km box around Ustaritz: **17 of 34 126 points
  (0,05 %) fall inside two zoning polygons, every one of them at a commune
  limit**. Seven urbanism documents overlap in that box across 73 polygon
  pairs and 5,3 ha — including 525 m² that Jatxou zones `UD` (urbaine) while
  Halsou zones the same ground `A` (agricole). Each commune digitises its own
  PLU against its own idea of where the limit runs, and the Géoportail stacks
  the documents without reconciling them. `zoneCount` is reported so the case
  reads as the register disagreeing with itself, not as a broken answer.
- **`typezone` has seven values, and the table had four — so the family this
  layer exists for was drawn in the unknown-value grey.** Measured across
  twelve APIcarto boxes (Paris, Lyon, Lille, Toulouse, Marseille, Rennes, five
  peri-urban boxes, Ustaritz): **4 216 zoning features and not one plain
  `AU`.** Every à-urbaniser zone published `AUc` or `AUs`. And that letter is
  the most decision-changing thing in the layer: **`AUc` is open** — the plot
  opposite can be built under the PLU as it stands — while **`AUs` is closed
  until the document is modified or revised**. Same magenta family, cooled and
  quieter. `Ah` and `Nh`, the built pockets inside the agricultural and
  natural zones, take their family's hue brightened.
- **The wash weights are measured, not felt.** The same polygon repainted at
  five alphas over an IGN orthophoto, each frame differenced against the
  unpainted one across the ~380 000 pixels the zone covers: **0.18 moved the
  picture by a mean of 3/255 in red and could not be seen at all**; 0.22 by 5,
  0.28 by 11, 0.33 by 17, 0.40 by 24. Shipped: `AUc` 0.42, the exceptions
  0.34, `U` 0.30, and `A`/`N` 0.22 — they are most of the country, and at the
  urban weight a natural zone washes a whole valley teal.
- **Servitudes stay lines, and the lines are dashed.** They are not zoning, and
  a solid stroke said they were. They are also the wrong size to fill: one
  measured `pm1` risk envelope is 759 polygons spanning kilometres, so a wash
  of it tints the view rather than a plot.
- Each zone card now names its family in words — *zone urbaine — déjà bâtie et
  équipée*, *zone à urbaniser OUVERTE* — and says how many enclaves were cut,
  so an unpainted island inside a painted zone reads as the register's, not as
  a gap in the draw.
- The five point-scan layers hand their renderer the viewer, and the urbanism
  layer redraws on a map-stack change. A ground-classification surface is read
  once, when the primitive is built, so a wash addressed to terrain drew
  nothing at all once the photoreal tileset hid the globe — the layer looked
  switched off. It rebuilds from the answer already in hand, with no refetch.

- Added the **Parcelles cadastrales** layer — the lines France taxes land
  along, keyless. IGN's **Api Carto** serves the DGFiP's *Plan Cadastral
  Informatisé* (PCI vecteur) under Licence Ouverte 2.0 with no key and no
  account: one polygon per parcel, with its section, its 14-character national
  `idu`, and the surface the tax administration has registered against it.
  Loaded per viewport, ground-clamped so it drapes on IGN ortho, on Bing and on
  the Google photoreal tileset alike.
- **A cadastral line is a fiscal line, not a legal one, and every card ends by
  saying so.** In France a property limit is fixed by *bornage* — a
  géomètre-expert's survey under article 646 of the Code civil — and the
  cadastre has no authority over it. A crisp polygon on a photorealistic globe
  is exactly the thing a reader takes for a surveyed limit.
- **How approximate each line is, is published, and nobody draws it.** Every
  parcel belongs to a *feuille*, and the feuille carries the scale of the plan
  it was drawn on. Measured across 673 sheets on 2026-09-01: **1:250** in
  central Strasbourg, **1:5000** over the Landes forest, a twentyfold spread
  with zero nulls. At the conventional 0,5 mm of drawn line that is ±0,13 m
  against ±2,5 m for the same word "boundary". Parcels are coloured by that
  band, and the card prints the figure with the assumption attached — a bare
  "±0,25 m" reads as a survey result.
- **The holes are the streets, and the row says how many.** The cadastre
  parcels private land, not the public domain, so a correct answer over a city
  centre is full of gaps. Clipped to the view and measured: **45,7 % of Lyon's
  Presqu'île** is cadastred, 32,7 % around the Champ-de-Mars, 80,9 % in the
  Marais — against 95,0 % of a Cantal block and 98,6 % of a Landes forest one.
  The layer reports the fraction so the gaps read as the public realm rather
  than as a broken feed.
- The service disagrees with itself in ways a naive read gets visibly wrong, so
  six of them are absorbed server-side and pinned against a captured answer:
  - **Api Carto caps every request at 5,000 features and says so only in
    `totalFeatures`.** `_limit=10000` over Paris returns exactly 5,000 of
    12,483, HTTP 200, no warning — and paging with `_start` walks an internal
    order that mixes arrondissements, so a truncated answer is a cadastre with
    *scattered* holes, which is precisely what a complete one looks like over
    the public domain. A box over the cap is refused whole and the true count
    is printed. At the layer's own 0.02° ceiling the densest French cities
    answer 2,100–2,400 parcels, so the refusal is the exception.
  - **A sheet is not identified by (commune, section, feuille).** Lyon
    publishes section `AL` feuille 1 in five arrondissements, and the 5e's copy
    is drawn at 1:1000 while the others are at 1:500 — a four-part join gives
    those parcels a coin-flipped tolerance. With `code_arr` in the key there
    were 0 collisions across 27,595 parcels and 450 sheets.
  - **`idu` does not start with `code_insee` for 38 % of urban France.** The
    first five characters are the *arrondissement* code: a Marais parcel is
    `75103000AP0045` while its `code_insee` is `75056`. Reassembling the key
    joins to nothing in DVF for Paris, Lyon and Marseille, so the published
    `idu` is carried verbatim and never rebuilt.
  - **`contenance` is a fiscal declaration, not a measurement of the polygon.**
    Mamoudzou publishes it as `null` and Ostwald as `0` — and `Number(null)` is
    `0`, which would turn "not published" into "declares zero square metres".
    Where both figures exist, 7,2 % of parcels differ by more than 5 % and
    1,0 % by more than 20 %. Both numbers are on the card and neither is
    averaged into the other.
  - **Courtyards are holes and a parcel can be in two pieces.** Dropping the
    Palais-Royal's interior ring moves its area from inside 1 % of the declared
    contenance to outside 5 %; a Marseille parcel is one identifier over two
    disjoint polygons.
  - **A section is not always letters.** Alsace-Moselle numbers its sections
    (`22`), Marseille prefixes with a digit (`0D`), and `com_abs` — the API's
    "commune absorbée" — runs 801–842 across Toulouse, a commune with no
    arrondissements at all. All are carried as opaque strings.

- Added the **Bornes IRVE** layer — every public EV charge point France has
- **Enseignement supérieur (FR) — the level the schools layer stops before.**
  The *Annuaire de l'éducation* ends at the baccalauréat: measured 2026-09-01,
  its `type_etablissement` has eight values and not one of them is a
  university, an IUT, an école d'ingénieurs, an école de commerce, an IFSI or a
  school of architecture. Joining the two registers on the UAI measures the
  hole — of the 6 509 establishments the ministry's Parcoursup cartography
  lists for the 2026 session, **3 492 appear nowhere in the Annuaire**. The new
  layer draws the MESR's own *Effectifs d'étudiants inscrits — détail par
  établissements* (Licence Ouverte 2.0, rentrée 2024): **6 294 establishments,
  6 914 sites, 2 960 012 students placed**, coloured by seven bands folded from
  the register's 14 published categories and sized by the students counted at
  that campus.
- **No thinning and no sampling, because the whole register fits.** Resolved to
  sites it is **0.62 MB gzipped with every name, band, roll, cycle mix, campus
  count, formation list and website on it** — what the `schools-fr` maillage
  costs (0.63 MB gzipped) while carrying no names at all. So there is no bbox endpoint,
  no ceiling and no spatial thinning: `/api/sup-fr/sites` hands the browser the
  register once and every zoom is answered from it. `/api/sup-fr/departements`
  is the ~30 KB national rollup built by the same sweep. Cold build, measured
  end to end against the live portal: **2.9 s**.
- **1 665 establishments have no coordinate, and the fix is a second register.**
  `geo` is null on 3 442 of the register's 22 068 rows — the Université de la
  Nouvelle-Calédonie and the Université de la Polynésie française among them.
  Nothing is placed at a commune centroid. The layer reads the ministry's
  *Cartographie des formations Parcoursup* (session 2026, 25 831 formations,
  every one geolocated) and borrows a coordinate ONLY where that file gives
  exactly one point for the UAI: **977 establishments and 82 200 students**,
  lifting placed enrolment from 95.69% to **98.41%**. The borrow was checked
  rather than assumed — where both files give one point, the median
  disagreement is **74 m** and 90% agree within 1 km. Polynésie is recovered
  this way; New Caledonia is not, so all 18 of its establishments are reported
  as unplaced instead of being invented into the Pacific. A borrowed coordinate
  says so on its card.
- **The choropleth counts students, not dots — and says why.** Counting sites,
  Paris (484) leads the Nord (292) by 1.66× and the top ten départements hold
  35%. Counting students, Paris (394 788) leads the Rhône (192 964) by 2.05×
  and the top ten hold **49.8%**. The site count is flatter because 2 800 of
  the 6 914 sites are lycées running a BTS — and a map of where BTS sections
  are is a map of where lycées are, which **Établissements scolaires** already
  draws. Those 2 800 shared addresses get their own legend band, and the two
  layers use deliberately different palettes (deep hues and a white dot outline
  here, pastels and a black one there) so a stacked dot reads as the overlap it
  is rather than as a duplicate.
- **The name on the globe is now a click surface.** Every label the shared
  overlay paints — the river gauge's name, the substation's, the power
  station's, the cable's — selects its object exactly as the dot does. It never
  did: labels are painted onto a `pointer-events: none` canvas stacked over the
  viewport, so `scene.pick()` under one returns the globe, and a click aimed at
  a name reached the terrain behind it and DISMISSED the selection instead. The
  name is what says which object this is, and it is five to twenty times the
  target area of the 5–15 px dot it floats above, so it is what people aim at.
  Wired into twelve layers — Hub'Eau, Réseau électrique, Réseau gaz, Production
  RTE, Petite hydro, Événements routiers, Écoles and Bornes IRVE (their
  département names at national altitude), Radio (station names only — a
  cluster badge names a count, not a station), Câbles sous-marins, the ISS
  label and the rocket-mission markers. The depth-tested primitive is still
  resolved first, so a name drawn across a NEIGHBOURING object can never steal
  that object's click, a pick a sibling layer owns is left alone, and a click on
  empty space still clears the selection. Proved in a real browser by
  `npm run qa:label-click`, which reads where the host painted a label,
  dispatches a real pointer event at its centre — nowhere near the dot — and
  asserts the layer's card starts painting.
- **Six French public registers, read from a coordinate.** Géorisques, DVF,
  the ADEME DPE register, the IGN isochrone service, the Géoportail de
  l'urbanisme and Île-de-France Mobilités are now integrated end to end —
  keyless, Licence Ouverte or ODbL, behind six new proxies with unit-tested
  projections. Five new layers scan around the ground point the camera is
  looking at: **Risques (Géorisques)**, **Ventes immobilières (DVF)**,
  **Performance énergétique (DPE)**, **Urbanisme (PLU & servitudes)** and
  **Réseau IDFM (Paris)**. Measured over avenue de France, Paris 13e: 30
  classified installations, 153 recorded sales with a median of **9 063 €/m²**,
  915 energy diagnostics within 200 m, a railway protection strip and two risk-
  prevention envelopes, and 36 transport stops including a métro entrance 30 m
  from the door.
- **Reachable area instead of a circle.** `/api/isochrone` serves IGN's Valhalla
  rings over BD TOPO®: a 15-minute walk from that address covers **2.16 km²**,
  a 15-minute drive **56.96 km²**. Only walking and driving exist — the service
  rejects `bicycle` with HTTP 400 and no cycling ring is modelled in its place.
- **The Paris transit blank is answered.** IDFM publishes no GTFS-Realtime
  vehicle positions at all, so the live-transit layer is empty over the city
  this fork opens on. The new IDFM layer draws the network OFFER — 37 956 stops,
  2 121 lines with their official liveries, step-free status where surveyed —
  and reports the live-vehicle absence in its own stats rather than looking
  broken.
- **Délinquance — une option « Tous », pour ne plus avoir à choisir un délit
  avant de voir quoi que ce soit.** La couche s'ouvrait sur un indicateur
  unique et il fallait en désigner un pour obtenir une carte : elle répondait
  « où sont les cambriolages » quand la question était « où ce registre est-il
  chargé ». Elle ouvre désormais sur un **total cumulé**, chip de tête,
  les six indicateurs dérivés à sa suite. Trois conditions le rendent
  publiable : il s'annonce comme un total **CALCULÉ par God's Eye View, pas
  publié par le SSMSI** — le registre publie dix-huit indicateurs et aucun
  total ; il annonce son unité mélangée (victimes, infractions, véhicules,
  mis en cause) au lieu de se dire « faits » ; et il écarte les deux
  sous-indicateurs `Usage de stupéfiants (AFD)` / `(hors AFD)`, qui sont la
  décomposition d'un troisième — vérifié, le parent vaut exactement AFD + hors
  AFD dans **101 départements sur 101**. Restent 14 contributeurs à l'échelle
  communale, 16 à l'échelle départementale.
- **Et à l'échelle communale, ce total est un MINORANT, ce que la carte dit
  commune par commune.** Le secret statistique n'existe pas dans la base
  départementale — le total y est exact, 3 306 254 faits pour 68 350 798
  habitants, du Cantal à 24,4 ‰ à Paris à 109,9 ‰ — mais il domine la base
  communale. Mesuré sur l'édition 2025, des 34 920 communes : **9 606 portent
  un total positif, dont 9 428 minorants et seulement 178 complets**, 243 sont
  un zéro mesuré complet, et 25 071 ne publient rien du tout et restent
  ardoise. Une carte qui peindrait ces 25 071 en « calme » serait le contraire
  de ce que cette couche existe pour faire. La fiche d'une commune annonce
  combien de ses quatorze indicateurs sont non diffusés, et la légende dit que
  le vrai total est plus élevé d'un montant inconnu. Au passage, le total est
  la carte la plus peignable du jeu : 9 606 communes contre 8 134 pour
  escroqueries, le meilleur indicateur publié.

### Changed
- **Le carroyage INSEE ne recouvre plus la carte : un disque par carreau, à
  plat, translucide.** Le calque dessinait chaque carreau EN ENTIER, bord à
  bord, extrudé selon sa population — et 2 109 carreaux sur l'agglomération
  bordelaise faisaient un patchwork opaque : plus une rue, plus un nom de lieu,
  plus un repère des autres calques. Le pire était que la hauteur, seul canal
  portant le compte, est invisible pour une caméra qui regarde vers le bas,
  c'est-à-dire la vue par défaut de cette application : on payait le fond de
  carte pour une information qu'on ne pouvait pas lire.
- **Le compte est désormais l'AIRE du disque, plus jamais une tour.** L'argument
  reste le même — « 27 100 € par personne » n'a pas d'étendue, la population
  s'additionne, donc c'est elle que la géométrie porte — mais l'aire se lit dans
  la projection que l'opérateur regarde vraiment. Un carreau de quatre ménages
  est un point, et il doit se lire comme quatre ménages.
- **Six tailles, pas une proportion continue — et c'est un calcul, pas un
  goût.** À l'écran, un carreau du maillage 1 km fait ~35 px : un symbole doit
  faire au moins 8 px pour être vu et au plus ~28 px pour rester dans sa case,
  soit 3:1 de diamètre disponible. La donnée, elle, va de 1 à 100 en effectif
  (médiane 109 habitants par km², contre 11 690 dans le carré le plus dense de
  la vue bordelaise). Une échelle strictement proportionnelle doit dépenser cet
  écart quelque part, et elle l'a fait : **65 % des 1 907 carreaux de cette vue
  se sont retrouvés au plancher**, le canal s'est aplati et une région d'un
  million d'habitants s'affichait vide. Six paliers le dépensent volontairement,
  et chaque palier se voit. C'est exactement le choix que la rampe de couleur
  fait déjà, pour la même raison : l'œil ne relit pas une grandeur continue en
  nombre, et la fiche porte le chiffre exact.
- **Les paliers de taille sont mesurés, un jeu par maillage.** Les quantiles
  nationaux de l'effectif : ceux du carroyage 200 m sont ceux de la rampe
  « population » (89 · 193 · 426 · 895 · 1 522 habitants), et
  `build-filosofi-ramp.mjs --resolution 1000` mesure enfin les siens pour le
  maillage grossier — **6 727 carreaux dans les mêmes 42 boîtes, 12 941 533
  habitants**, p90 à 28 652. Multiplier les paliers fins par 25 aurait été
  l'arithmétique évidente et se trompe de 33 % en haut : les carreaux de 200 m
  qui composent un kilomètre dense ne sont pas tous denses. La légende publie
  les six seuils, sinon c'est une échelle que personne ne peut relire.
- **Deux garde-fous, écrits comme des règles et testés comme telles :** un
  symbole ne dépasse jamais 0,68 du côté de son carreau — 36 % de sa surface —
  et il est tracé à 70 % d'opacité. Le fond passe donc ENTRE les disques et À
  TRAVERS. Dans le 2e arrondissement de Paris, le cas le plus dense du pays,
  les boulevards, la Seine et les noms d'arrondissement restent lisibles.
- **Un carreau imputé est un ANNEAU, plus un carré rentré.** Le canal « rentré »
  servait à distinguer les valeurs modélisées ; il porte maintenant le compte,
  donc l'imputation passe sur la forme. L'anneau est agrandi pour récupérer
  exactement l'aire que son trou lui enlève : l'évidement dit d'où vient le
  chiffre, jamais combien il vaut. Et la légende porte enfin ses trois canaux —
  la rampe, l'aire (avec la population qu'elle totalise) et l'anneau (avec le
  nombre de carreaux modélisés).

### Fixed
- **Le seuil de déplacement des six calques d'adresse ne servait à rien.**
  `ADDRESS_SCAN_MIN_SHIFT_KM` documente 250 m comme la distance en dessous de
  laquelle la réponse en main décrit encore le même pâté de maisons — mais la
  comparaison qui l'appliquait était liée par un ET à une comparaison de la
  requête complète, coordonnées comprises, écrites à six décimales. Une caméra
  qui se posait un mètre plus loin produisait une chaîne différente et
  redemandait : le seuil n'a jamais supprimé une seule requête. Les deux moitiés
  sont désormais comparées séparément — le centre par la distance, le reste par
  la chaîne — ce qui préserve exactement la raison d'être de la seconde (le
  calque d'urbanisme change de question sans que le centre bouge) et rend la
  première effective. Trouvé en montant le plafond de la zone de chalandise à
  45 km, où un panoramique tranquille franchit 250 m sans que la vue change.
- **Une fiche de délinquance faisait toute la largeur de l'écran — et sur une
  fenêtre un peu plus étroite, elle disparaissait.** Un même bug, deux
  symptômes opposés. La largeur d'une fiche était « celle de sa plus longue
  ligne », sans plafond et sans retour à la ligne : parfait pour `450 KT ·
  FL350`, catastrophique pour une couche qui **cite son éditeur mot pour mot**
  — la phrase du SSMSI sur la propension à porter plainte mesure à elle seule
  ~1 900 px. En Gironde, la fiche d'une commune barrait donc le viewport de
  bord à bord. Autour d'Aubazine en Corrèze, la même fiche était illisible pour
  la raison inverse : dès qu'une fiche dépasse l'écran, le calage la plaque
  contre la marge, ce qui **déplace son centre** — et le fondu du keyhole lit
  le centre. Hors du cercle de visée, tout est peint au plancher
  `KEYHOLE_OUTSIDE_OPACITY_DEFAULT`, soit **0,01** : si claire et si
  transparente qu'on ne lisait rien. Et les communes les plus touchées étaient
  celles qui ont le plus de texte, c'est-à-dire celles dont les cellules sont
  retenues — Aubazine porte dix indicateurs non diffusés sur quatorze.
  Les fiches à texte empilé (`card`, `selected`, `tracked`) enroulent
  désormais leur texte sous un plafond partagé de **420 px**, resserré si le
  viewport est plus étroit, avec césure des mots plus longs qu'une ligne ; le
  peintre dessine l'enroulement mesuré et non la source. Le calcul est mis en
  cache sur l'entrée, donc une image stable n'alloue rien de plus.
  `scripts/qa-delinquance-fr.mjs` mesure le rectangle réellement peint — sa
  largeur, sa présence dans le viewport, et la distance de son centre au
  keyhole — parce que c'était la cause commune des deux symptômes.
- **Une caméra sélectionnée rendait VERTE au lieu d'ambre, parce que son icône avait sa propre couleur cuite dedans.** Cesium multiplie `billboard.color` dans la texture. La couche CCTV s'en sert pour dire laquelle des caméras l'opérateur a sélectionnée — `#6be8ff` au repos, `#ffd97a` pour l'active — mais le dessin portait du cyan en dur (`#75e7ff` sur des aplats sombres, plus un dégradé de lentille). #75e7ff × #ffd97a = **#75c57a** : la seule caméra que l'ambre devait isoler était la seule à ne pas être ambre. Le cyan de repos sortait lui aussi faux, sursaturé à #31d2ff. L'icône est maintenant `temaki/security_camera` en tracé blanc sur halo sombre, comme tous les autres jeux de ce dépôt le documentent depuis le début : le blanc rend la multiplication neutre, le noir y survit (0 × c = 0) et garde le glyphe lisible sur une orthophoto claire. Au passage, un détail de caméra murale dessiné pour 36 px cesse d'être bouilli en un pâté bleu à 15. Une teinte cuite est un bug, pas un parti pris — `mapIcons.test.mjs` refuse désormais tout glyphe portant un dégradé, une opacité ou un hexadécimal autre que `#ffffff`.
- **"Sites militaires — Context is temporarily unavailable", while Overpass was
  merely busy.** The layer went dark under normal panning and the server log
  said nothing, so the failure was indistinguishable from a dead upstream. It
  was a rate limit this app manufactured itself. `GET /api/status` on
  overpass-api.de answers **"Rate limit: 2"** — two concurrent slots per IP —
  and the rotation was never four mirrors wide — it was **four hostnames over
  two machines**. `lz4.overpass-api.de` resolves to `65.109.112.52`, one of the
  two addresses `overpass-api.de` itself answers with, and both facades report
  `Announced endpoint: lambert.openstreetmap.de/`; `overpass.kumi.systems` is a
  CNAME onto `overpass.private.coffee` (both land on `193.219.97.30`), and that
  host answered a bodyless **502 in ~3 s** on every probe. So half the list
  bought no redundancy and simply paid the same dead host's timeout twice.
  `overpass.kumi.systems` has been dropped. Nothing paced the requests: the installations proxy
  called straight through with no gate at all, and the generic Overpass proxy
  allowed six in flight against a budget of two. A burst of eight drew **429 on
  requests 6 and 8** — and a 429 is a verdict on the **IP**, not on the mirror,
  so "try the next one" collected the same 429, then six seconds of dead
  community mirrors, then surfaced a bare 503. Sequentially, **two of six**
  requests failed that way.
  Upstream requests are now queued at the budget the mirrors actually publish —
  two in flight, waiting rather than failing, proceeding ungated after 20 s so a
  busy moment can never become an error — and a reported rate limit is **waited
  out** (1.5 s, then 4 s) instead of rotated away, since waiting is the only
  move a per-IP limit responds to. The two healthy facades lead the rotation so
  the ~6 s of dead weight is only ever paid after the mirrors that answer have
  failed, and the installations proxy now **names the cause** in the server log
  — rate limit, server-side timeout, or refusal — because the three need
  different fixes and looked identical before.
- **A blocked IP made the globe feel hung, not degraded.** overpass-api.de does
  not only rate-limit an IP it dislikes; it stops answering it. Provoked while
  testing the fix above, the block outlasted **four minutes** of polling,
  `/api/status` included — and every rotation during it spent **47 s** of
  timeouts to learn the same thing, once per camera move, while still sending
  the traffic that caused it. A rotation where no mirror answers at all now
  parks the whole Overpass path for a minute, so the next caller fails in
  **1.7 ms** instead of 47 s and lands straight on its stale cache (measured
  live during that block). A rate limit is deliberately excluded — it is the
  recoverable case, and parking it would trade a two-second wait for a minute of
  blindness. The layer's disk cache, meanwhile, kept serving previously visited
  ground throughout the outage in **9 ms**.

- **Clicking a parcel highlighted a wedge with the NEIGHBOUR's corners.** The
  cadastral outline under the cursor was square and correct, and the cyan fill
  poured into it was a diagonal blob with two edges that belonged to no parcel
  at all. Measured over Ustaritz on parcel AN 0512: **41% of the plot filled**,
  and the two straight cuts through the highlight sat on parcel AN 0511's east
  and north **bounding-box** edges to within one pixel. That is the tell. A
  batched `GroundPrimitive` does not colour a ground pixel by the polygon that
  contains it — Cesium classifies the whole batch in ONE stencil pass, which
  records only "some instance here", and the colour pass then keeps the first
  instance whose kilometres-tall shadow volume reaches the pixel and whose own
  axis-aligned bounding rectangle contains it. Parcel bounding rectangles
  overlap their neighbours' constantly, so inside one batch neighbours repaint
  each other along rectangle edges. It was invisible while every parcel in the
  batch shared a band colour, and glaring the moment selection made one differ.
  Fills are now batched **by band colour** — five primitives at most, against
  one before and one-per-parcel never — and the selected parcel is drawn as a
  primitive of its own laid over the batch. The highlight now matches the
  parcel's own polygon to an intersection-over-union of **0.98 nadir and 0.98
  oblique**, against 0.44 and 0.14 before, proved on pixels by the new
  `npm run qa:cadastre-highlight`.
- **A digue titled "Barrage" — the pack knew better than the card.** Reported
  from the map: a "Barrage · 159 m de long" at Octeville-sur-Mer where no
  barrage is visible. Checked against OpenStreetMap: `w860215522` carries the
  single tag `man_made=dyke`, four nodes, no water body within 250 m — an
  anti-ruissellement bund on the Rouelles watershed, not a dam. The 159 m was
  never wrong; it is `spanM`, measured off the drawn geometry, and it
  recomputes to 159 m from the raw nodes. The word was wrong. The pack has
  stored `kind` since the two-axis rebuild and colours digues ochre, but the
  card title fell through to the LAYER's name whenever a feature had none of
  its own — which titled **1 198 digues, 24 barrage-digues and 88 unclassified
  world features "Barrage"**, out of 5 948 nameless features in a pack of
  7 432. Nameless features are now titled by what they ARE, in the same words
  the chips and the legend already use: Barrage, Digue, Barrage-digue, or
  Ouvrage for the world half that has no `kind` left to read. The second
  reported sighting settles what these actually are: `w849340116` is the bund
  of `w849340115`, tagged `natural=water` + `water=basin` + `intermittent=yes`
  — the embankment of a dry retention basin.

- **"Sites militaires — Error loading" was one mirror refusing, and three
  healthy ones never asked.** Every viewport answered HTTP 503, and the layer
  was right to say so: `/api/military-installations` reads `status >= 400` as a
  failure. The failure was underneath it. `overpass-api.de` scores requests for
  abuse at its Apache front-end and was returning a bare **406 Not Acceptable**
  to the proxy's agent string — a plain HTML page matching neither the
  rate-limit nor the runtime-error sniffer. Measured 2026-09-01, same query,
  interleaved to control for server load: the old
  `gods-eye-view-overpass-proxy/1.0` drew a 406 on **8 of 11** attempts, an
  OSM-conventional `app/version (+contact)` agent on **0 of 11**. That alone was
  survivable; what made it fatal is that `fetchOverpassPayload` rotated to the
  next mirror only on 429/5xx, so a 4xx ended the chain at mirror 1 with three
  mirrors untried below it. A 4xx is a MIRROR verdict, not a query verdict, and
  now rotates — the same rule the mapped-camera and power-grid probes already
  applied, which is why those layers stayed up through the same outage. A
  genuinely malformed query still surfaces: every mirror rejects it, nothing
  outranks it, the caller gets the 4xx back. Third fault, and the one that would
  have outlived the other two: `/api/overpass` cached anything under `< 500`, so
  the refusal was written to memory AND to disk under a **7-to-30-day TTL** and
  re-served as a `HIT` without asking upstream again — one bad minute upstream
  taking every Overpass-backed layer down for a month. Success only, now, and a
  4xx joins 5xx in serving last-good from disk at any age. Measured back to back
  on the same server, fresh cache keys: Lyon, Marseille and Nantes went 503 →
  200 with 21, 23 and 4 installations; in the browser the layer reports `ready`
  with BA107 Villacoublay, le Mont-Valérien and le Fort de Rosny drawn. Six
  regression tests in `overpassProxy.test.mjs` pin the rotation. Worth knowing
  separately: the other three mirrors were all answering 502/504 that day, so
  `overpass-api.de` was the only healthy one — which is why this filter hit so
  hard.

- **"Bâti 3D could not start cleanly" was a camera, not a fault.** Turning the
  layer on from a wide view failed outright: the toggle flipped straight back
  to OFF under an error toast, with a perfectly healthy IGN feed behind it. Two
  faults, one symptom. The layer refuses a request box wider than **0.08°** and
  returned that refusal as `false` out of its first `update()` — which the data
  manager reads as the module REJECTING its lifecycle, so it tore the layer
  down and said so. A load that fetched nothing because it was asked for
  nothing is now not a failed load, in Bâti 3D, the mapped grid and Hub'Eau
  alike. And the guidance it replaces is now carried out instead of announced:
  an explicit enable **flies the camera to the view the layer needs** and loads
  it. Measured over France at 420 km: 420 000 m → 2 900 m, buildings drawn, no
  error published anywhere. The flight only answers explicit intent — a share
  link or a Context restore keeps its own camera — it zooms in and never out,
  it steepens a horizon-facing pitch (no altitude alone can shrink a view that
  reaches the horizon), and it refuses to fly at all when the coverage in shot
  is a sliver at the edge of a camera aimed somewhere else: 400 km over Berlin
  clipping Alsace stays over Berlin. New harness: `npm run qa:view-gate`.

- **A scan with no coordinates no longer answers about the Gulf of Guinea.**
  `searchParams.get('lon')` is `null` when absent, `Number(null)` is `0`, and
  `Number.isFinite(0)` is true, so `GET /api/gpu` with no query string returned
  HTTP 200 and an empty result for 0°N 0°E — indistinguishable from "there is
  nothing at your address". Now HTTP 400. Pinned by `addressProxy.test.mjs`.

- **The address markers were unclickable, and half of each one was eaten by the
  ground.** Two separate faults, both invisible to a unit test. The app runs
  with `infoBox: false`, so an entity's `description` displays nothing on its
  own — every layer must own a `LEFT_CLICK` handler, and these five did not, so
  clicking a marker did nothing at all. Separately, `disableDepthTestDistance`
  was a finite 2 500 m, which re-enables depth testing the moment the camera is
  further off than that: at city zoom the terrain clipped the lower half of
  every disc. Markers now draw always-on-top, own a click handler, and open the
  same world-overlay card as their sibling layers.
- **Five registers over one building, drawn as five identical dots.** Turn on
  Ventes immobilières and Performance énergétique together and both painted
  coloured discs over the same roofs, with nothing to say which register a dot
  came from. Size and hue were already spoken for — DVF spends its colour on
  the price against the local median, DPE on the official A–G scale — so SHAPE
  was the only channel left, and it is the right one anyway: it survives at
  16 px and it survives colour blindness. Each register now draws what it is
  about: a **€** for a sale, **the A–G letter in a frame** for a diagnostic (so
  the grade no longer needs a click), a **hazard triangle** for Géorisques, a
  **plan sheet** for the PLU, and **the mode's own pictogram** for an IDFM
  stop. Every glyph is white line-art over a dark halo and carries no hue of
  its own, so `billboard.color` still delivers each layer's value channel
  untouched.

- **The address markers slid across the city as you moved the camera.**
  `Cartesian3.fromDegrees(lon, lat)` puts a marker on the ELLIPSOID, at height
  0, and the globe draws avenue de France at **79 to 83 m** — so every DVF sale,
  every DPE diagnostic, every risk site and every IDFM stop stood eighty metres
  under the street it describes, painted anyway because depth testing is off.
  Under an oblique camera a vertical error is a HORIZONTAL error on screen, and
  it changes with every camera pose: measured at 700 m and a pitch of −35°, a
  DVF dot landed **83 px** from its own address, and turning the camera moved
  that error **62 px sideways**. The reported symptom was exactly that — the
  dots are not fixed, they move when you nudge the map. Markers are now placed
  at the height of the terrain the globe is actually rendering, and re-seated as
  terrain streams in and as the LOD refines. Measured after the fix: 0 px, from
  both poses, on all five layers.
- **The address layers only noticed you had moved every five minutes.** They
  are camera-driven, but their refresh cadence is the manager's tick — 5 to 15
  minutes, right for registers that change in weeks and useless for someone
  flying across a city. Navigating to a new address left the previous
  neighbourhood's answer on screen until the timer happened to fire, which reads
  exactly as "the layer has trouble refreshing". All five now listen to
  `camera.moveEnd` with a 450 ms settle, matching the BD TOPO layer, behind a
  single-flight guard so a fly-through queues one repeat rather than a request
  per frame. They also request a repaint explicitly: the render governor runs in
  `requestRenderMode`, so a redraw nobody asks to paint never reaches the screen.
- **`HeightReference.CLAMP_TO_GROUND` makes a point unpickable.** It reads like
  the right answer for an annotation that belongs to a building; measured in the
  running app it produced 30 drawn Géorisques points where `scene.pick` and
  `scene.drillPick` both returned nothing. No point layer in this repo uses it,
  and these no longer do either.
- **Zoning outlines are not click targets, and no longer pretend to be.**
  Clamped polylines render as ground primitives and are not pickable here — 62
  vertices of one easement ring on screen, `scene.pick` null at every one.
  Widening the stroke did not help. The urbanism layer now plants a marker at
  the point it scanned, carrying the zone, its approval date and the easements
  crossing it, because a zoning rule describes the ground under an address
  rather than a particular line on a map.

### Notes

- Every price per square metre this release computes is deliberately absent for
  multi-lot sales, swaps and auctions. One captured Paris mutation is
  €32 000 000 spread over **179 rows**: summing the column inflates the 2024
  edition of the 13ᵉ from €0.89 bn to €15.33 bn, and dividing the first row by
  its 25 m² flat gives €1.28 million per square metre. The register does not say
  how such a sale was split, so neither does the layer.
- Added the **Établissements scolaires** layer — every school France
  registers, keyless. The *Annuaire de l'éducation* is published by the
  Ministère de l'Éducation nationale on data.education.gouv.fr under Licence
  Ouverte 2.0 and rebuilt daily: 68,939 rows on 2026-09-01, of which 68,557 are
  open and **68,158 are open and carry a coordinate** — the set the layer
  draws. Three regimes by view span, as the IRVE layer: the 96 départements
  with the country in view, a spatially thinned *maillage* of real positions in
  between, and every establishment with its card over a city. Coloured by
  school level, sized by pupils.
- The register holds no roll, so the roll is a join, and its completeness is
  stated rather than assumed. Dot size comes from the ministry's four per-level
  *effectifs* datasets at rentrée 2025, joined on the UAI: **57,683 of the
  62,918 open, geolocated teaching establishments get one (91.7%)**,
  11,237,267 pupils in total. The 5,235 that do not are named — 2,212 are
  sub-UAI SEGPA and SEP *sections* whose pupils are already counted inside the
  collège or lycée at the same coordinate, and 455 are under the ministry of
  Agriculture. A school with no roll draws at the base size and its card says
  *effectif non publié*; it is never drawn as, or described as, a school with
  no pupils.
- The register's own uncertainties are surfaced instead of flattened:
  - `precision_localisation` is its account of its own geocoding, and it is not
    uniform — **2,159 rows are placed at their commune's centroid, not at the
    school**. Those cards say so. The 22 published spellings fold onto a
    four-step ladder, and an unrecognised one resolves to *unknown* rather than
    inheriting "exact address".
  - **399 open establishments have no coordinate at all**, and 332 of them are
    one place: French Polynesia's 311 and Wallis-et-Futuna's 21 are ungeocoded
    in their entirety. They are excluded at the query rather than placed at a
    commune centroid, and the shortfall is carried to the client.
  - A UAI is an administrative unit, not a building, so two dots can share one
    address. Every site carries its `etablissement_mere`, and the card names
    the parent.
  - `restauration`, `hebergement`, `ulis`, `segpa` and `apprentissage` publish
    1, 0 **and null**, where null means "not declared". The card lists what is
    declared present rather than denying what was never stated.
- The national choropleth is metropolitan and admits it. The bundled
  département polygons are 96 features with no overseas geometry, so **2,762
  open, geolocated schools cannot be painted** — La Réunion's 855, Guadeloupe's
  448, Martinique's 403 and the rest, plus 9 island schools the simplified
  outlines drop. They are counted, named, and reported on the national row
  line; the other two regimes draw positions and show all of them. Assignment
  is point-in-polygon and never a code join, because the register spells
  Corsica `02A` where the IGN outlines say `2A`.

- **The roads the State measures but never says where.** Bison Futé's counting-station
  referential publishes a position for 843 of its 1 367 stations. The other 525 are
  not positionless — 153 of them publish an ADDRESS, the point repère that the French
  road network is actually numbered by, and every kilometre post of the non-conceded
  network is published with its Lambert-93 coordinates in a second open dataset, the
  [Bornage du réseau routier national](https://www.data.gouv.fr/datasets/bornage-du-reseau-routier-national)
  (51 940 posts, Licence Ouverte 2.0, keyless). Joining the two recovers **all 115
  stations of DIR Ouest**, which had never been drawn, plus 26 of DIR Atlantique, 10 of
  DIR Centre-Est and 2 of DIR Est. The join is **calibrated on every build rather than
  trusted**: 831 stations publish an address *and* a coordinate, and resolving theirs
  disagrees with the DIRs' own answer by a **median of 3.8 m** (p90 7.2 m, max 64 m,
  99.8 % within 25 m) — because the DIRs derive the coordinates they publish from this
  very referential. The number is recomputed and stored in the committed index each
  run, so an edition that stopped agreeing would move it in the build log before it
  moved a station on screen.
- **Nantes, Rennes, Saint-Brieuc and Lorient–Vannes are on the map.** The four Breton
  traffic centres publish 619 live road states under identifiers that appear in no
  referential row — which is why the layer drew nothing over a quarter of Brittany.
  Those identifiers turned out to be point-repère addresses themselves:
  `35A0084T096_00D` is département 35, route A84, PR 96, abscissa 0, right-hand
  carriageway. **602 of them resolve**, four cities move from the layer's "state
  published, position withheld" table to its showcase list, and the committed geometry
  goes from **1 195 sites / 832 located** to **1 958 / 1 587**, 608 of them full
  segments over **975 km**. A site placed this way says so on its card — *"position
  resolved from its kilometre post (PR), median 4 m"* — because a derived position and
  a published one are not the same claim.
- **Segments follow the surveyed centre of their own carriageway.** The referential
  gives a counting station two endpoints and nothing in between, so every segment was
  drawn as a straight chord. Threading the kilometre posts between the two ends was the
  first answer and it could not carry the layer: **the median segment is 948 m long and
  the median post interval 1 000 m**, so 643 of 842 segments contained no post at all
  and stayed straight. The drawn line sat a median **56 m** from its own tarmac, 142 m
  at p90, **411 segments past 25 m** — on the Bordeaux rocade, a green line cutting the
  inside of every curve. The shape now comes from the dataset next door:
  [Liaisons du réseau routier national](https://www.data.gouv.fr/datasets/liaisons-du-reseau-routier-national)
  (DGITM, Licence Ouverte 2.0, keyless) publishes **56 205 polylines, 1.66 M vertices,
  one per point-repère interval, at a mean 26 m between vertices** — against the
  1 000 m the posts offered. **The join needs no geometry at all**: every section NAMES
  the two posts it runs between, in the address grammar this build already reads, so it
  is placed in the same cumulative-distance space the bornage is sorted by — and the
  coordinates are then free to be checked rather than trusted. Over 33 483 joined
  sections the polylines' own ends sit **0 m from the posts they name at p50, p90 and
  p99**: the two files are cut from the same survey. **589 of the 608 real segments
  trace** (96.9 %), simplified at 4 m — under the width of a traffic lane — for a
  committed file of 485 KB against 364 KB. The 19 that do not are slip roads and
  unnumbered axes the point-repère referential does not address; they keep the post
  threading, or the chord, exactly as before. Three guards refuse to shape rather than
  guess: a section drawn more than 50 m from the posts it names, an endpoint more than
  150 m from any post of the road it names, and a trace running more than three times
  the straight line between its ends — the ring-road case, where shaping would wrap a
  segment around the whole of Bordeaux.
- **Lille stays dark, and that is a measurement, not a gap.** DIR Nord's 357 site ids
  were tested against the bornage both ways they can be read: three digits as the PR
  fits 24 % of them, two digits fits 75 % — but the two-digit reading puts DIR Nord's
  A1 sensors at PR 12–30, which is département 95, inside Île-de-France and 150 km
  outside its territory. A grammar that has to be wrong to parse is not the grammar,
  so the empty-state sentence over Lille now reads "under site ids that are neither a
  referential row nor an address" and the city keeps its explanation.

### Changed

- **Les lettres A–G du DPE sont maintenant celles d'Inter, la police de l'interface — plus des tracés faits à la main.** Les huit badges étaient sept chemins tracés au trait dans ce fichier, plus un point d'interrogation : épaisseur constante, des arcs là où une police a des courbes, et aucun rapport entre une lettre et la suivante au-delà d'une boîte englobante commune. Ça se lisait comme une **calligraphie approximative**, pas comme du texte composé — le B et le G le disaient le plus fort. Tout le reste de l'iconographie de ce projet est l'image d'un OBJET ; une lettre, non : c'est un caractère, et les caractères sont le métier des dessinateurs de caractères. Les contours viennent donc d'**Inter** (SIL OFL 1.1), extraits une fois au build avec fontkit à l'instance `wght 700, opsz 14` — l'axe de taille optique réglé sur 14 et pas 32 exprès, parce qu'il ouvre les contreformes pour les petits corps et que ça s'affiche à 15 px. Inter précisément parce que l'application compose déjà toute son interface avec (`--font-sans`) : un badge sur le globe et la même note imprimée sur la fiche sont désormais les mêmes lettres. **Aucun point de contrôle n'est déplacé** : chaque `d` est stocké tel que la police le contient, dans son espace em de 2048 unités, et le placement dans la boîte de 96 — hauteur de capitale à 42, ligne de base à y=70, centrage sur la boîte propre de la lettre, y inversé — est un `transform` SVG appliqué au rendu, donc vérifiable. Le halo de la lettre est volontairement plus fin que celui du reste du pack (5 au lieu de 12) : un contour strié grossit vers l'intérieur autant que vers l'extérieur, et à 12 la panse du A se referme et le badge se lit comme un triangle. Aucun fichier de police n'est redistribué, seulement huit contours.
- **Maki et Temaki — deux jeux d'icônes CARTOGRAPHIQUES à côté de Material Symbols, et un téléphérique qui cesse de ressembler à un immeuble.** Material Symbols est dessiné pour 24 px dans un menu ; Maki (Mapbox) et Temaki (l'éditeur iD d'OpenStreetMap) sont dessinés dans une boîte de 15 unités pour une étiquette posée sur de l'imagerie — soit exactement la bande où ces couches dessinent, 15 à 29 px CSS. Ce n'est pas une migration : Material garde les douze classes qu'il dessine bien. `aerial` passe à `maki/aerialway`, une cabine suspendue à son câble, là où `cable_car` est une cabine à pieds qui se lit comme un bâtiment à 22 px. Les deux jeux sont en **CC0 1.0** — dédicace au domaine public, donc aucune obligation d'attribution, contrairement à l'Apache-2.0 de Material et à son NOTICE à propager. `licenses/maki/` et `licenses/temaki/` existent quand même : consigner d'où vient une œuvre reprise est la discipline de ce dépôt, pas une contrainte de licence. Seule la chaîne `d` de chaque tracé est reprise, verbatim, dans la boîte de 15 unités de chaque jeu — jamais remise à l'échelle, ce qui serait un redessin. `cable_car` est retiré du dépôt, pas seulement laissé inutilisé, et le NOTICE de Material le dit.
- **Accueil du jeune enfant — le taux se lit sur le territoire, plus sur un point posé au milieu.** La couche dessinait ses deux échelles locales en pastilles au centre administratif de chaque zone. Un taux de couverture est une propriété d'un TERRITOIRE : posé sur une coordonnée il devient la propriété d'un centroïde — un champ à l'écart de la commune-siège pour une intercommunalité rurale, un point du 5e pour une Métropole — et rien à l'écran ne disait où le chiffre cessait de s'appliquer. Les 1 250 intercommunalités et les 1 061 communes sont désormais REMPLIES, en classification au sol, à partir des contours communaux de `geo.api.gouv.fr`.
- **Une intercommunalité n'a aucun contour publié : elle est peinte comme ses communes membres.** `geo.api.gouv.fr` ne publie pas de polygone d'EPCI et refuse une requête de contours non filtrée — 1 255 appels, 66 Mo, 3,1 millions de sommets (mesuré). Mais il publie `codeEpci` à côté de chaque commune, sans appel supplémentaire : le territoire d'une EPCI est donc dessiné comme ses communes membres, sous UNE seule couleur et sans liseré intérieur, pour se lire comme une zone et non comme une mosaïque. Ce qui manque est le trait extérieur de l'union, et rien ne l'invente.
- **Les deux échelles pavent le sol, elles ne se superposent jamais.** Sous 0,45° d'ouverture, chacune des 1 061 communes que la Cnaf publie est DÉCOUPÉE dans le lavis de son EPCI et remplie de son propre taux : chaque parcelle de sol porte exactement un chiffre, le plus fin publié pour elle, et le liseré blanc dit lequel. Deux fonds translucides ne peuvent donc plus se mélanger en une troisième couleur qui ne veut rien dire. Paris, Lyon et Marseille sont le cas dur — la Cnaf publie par arrondissement, `geo.api.gouv.fr` répond une commune unique — et l'arrondissement remplace sa commune-mère au lieu de s'y ajouter, la mère disparaissant entièrement du lavis.
- **Le service répond par BOÎTE, pas par département.** Les contours ne se récupèrent qu'un département à la fois en amont ; ils sont donc mémorisés entiers côté proxy et DÉCOUPÉS à la vue. Mesuré sur cinq villes, une boîte de 0,9° recoupe 4 à 18 départements — Paris étant le pire, ses départements étant les plus petits — donc servir les paquets entiers enverrait le Pas-de-Calais parce qu'un coin de l'écran l'a effleuré. Coût mesuré : **111 Ko pour une vue sur Lyon (32 Ko gzippés)**, et 2,03 Mo / 636 Ko dans le pire cas mesuré (1,3° sur l'Île-de-France, 2 261 communes, 4,5 s à froid et 9 ms à chaud). La boîte est calée sur une grille de 0,1° avant d'être demandée, donc un panoramique ne repose la question que toutes les quelques largeurs d'écran.
- **Le choroplèthe départemental descend jusqu'à la relève, il n'y a plus aucun zoom sans territoire.** Il répondait au-dessus de 9,5° parce que les pastilles prenaient le relais en dessous ; il tient maintenant jusqu'à 0,9°, où les territoires prennent la main. Le plafond est mesuré et non choisi : une boîte de 0,9° contient environ 1 450 communes, du même ordre que les lots de parcelles que cette application dessine déjà.
- **Un lot groupé de `GroundPrimitive` porte UNE couleur.** Cesium classe tout un lot en une passe de stencil, puis garde le premier instance dont le RECTANGLE ENGLOBANT contient le pixel — jamais le polygone. Les rectangles de communes voisines se chevauchent en permanence, donc un lot est constitué par couleur de bande (six au plus) et la sélection est un couple de primitives à elle, posé par-dessus. `npm run qa:petite-enfance-fr` le garde sur les pixels : le sol sous un territoire prend bien la couleur de SA bande, aucun anneau n'est dessiné deux fois, et le choroplèthe ne laisse aucune primitive derrière lui.
- **Ce que la carte ne dit plus.** La taille des pastilles portait le nombre de places, donc la couche répondait à deux questions à la fois. Un remplissage n'a qu'un canal et il va au taux — la question que l'indicateur existe pour poser. Le nombre de places reste sur chaque fiche, et l'alternative était une pastille flottant au-dessus de son propre territoire.
- Le découpage des contours communaux et la recherche « quels départements dans cette boîte » vivent maintenant dans `src/data/communeContours.js` et `src/data/franceDepartements.js`, partagés par la couche délinquance et la couche petite enfance au lieu d'être dupliqués. `delinquanceFeed.js` garde sa surface d'export et ses mesures ; ses suites de tests inchangées sont ce qui prouve que l'extraction est fidèle.

- The maillage thinning and the point-in-département lookup now live in
  `src/data/geoMeshThinning.js` and `src/data/franceDepartements.js`, shared by
  the charge-point and schools layers instead of duplicated. `irveMesh.js` and
  `irveDepartements.js` keep their full export surface and their measurements;
  their unchanged test suites are what prove the extraction was faithful.

- **The Data Layers panel is grouped and in French.** Thirty-four datasets no
  longer arrive as one flat list ordered by the accident of which PR merged
  first. They sit in **eight thematic groups** — *Air & espace, Défense,
  Maritime, Mobilité terrestre, Énergie, Risques & environnement, Réseaux &
  capteurs, Bâti & territoire* — each a collapsible section whose header carries
  its own tally (*"2/8 ON"*) and turns cyan while anything in it is live. Every
  group opens by default; a group you close is remembered, per group, across
  reloads.
- **Every row now reads in French.** *Live Flights* is **Vols en direct**, *Live
  AIS Vessels* is **Navires en direct**, *Mapped Installations* is **Sites
  militaires**, *Street Traffic* is **Trafic routier**, *Groupes de prod (FR)*
  is **Groupes de production**. The five `(FR)` suffixes are gone: a small
  **FR** / **US** / **VILLES** chip now says where a layer has data, once, on
  the sixteen rows where the answer is not "everywhere" — and nothing at all on
  a global layer, because a badge on every row is a badge on none. The panel
  widened from 280 to 320 px to hold the longer names on one line.- Added the **Bornes IRVE** layer — every public EV charge point France has
  declared, keyless. The *fichier consolidé des bornes de recharge pour
  véhicules électriques* is assembled daily by transport.data.gouv.fr from the
  operators' own filings and republished by **ODRÉ** under Licence Ouverte 2.0:
  231,079 points de charge, loaded per viewport, drawn as one dot per *site*,
  coloured by the highest power band installed there and sized by how many
  charge points are there. Clicking one gives the split by power, the
  connectors, the access conditions, the operators — and the span of that
  site's own declarations rather than the age of the poll.
- It is installed capacity, not availability, and says so. The register
  publishes where the charge points are, never whether any of them is free, so
  the layer draws no availability colour and prints no "libre" count.
- The register disagrees with itself in ways that a naive read gets visibly
  wrong, so seven of them are absorbed server-side and pinned against a
  captured payload:
  - `coordonneesxy` is **labelled backwards** — its `lon` key holds the
    latitude — on every row checked, and `geo_point_borne` is null on all
    231,079, so Opendatasoft's own geo filter matches nothing. Only the
    consolidated columns are read.
  - The station id fragments the station: Q-Park's Grande Arche car park
    publishes **127 station ids at one coordinate**, and 1,192 rows nationally
    publish the literal string `"Non concerné"`. The render unit is the
    coordinate, rounded to ~1.1 m.
  - 442 of 3,812 Île-de-France sites carry two "operators" publishing an
    **identical** power profile at the same point — 7.5% of the area's charge
    points, counted twice by any plain sum. Identical profiles collapse;
    overlapping ones never do; both totals travel to the client.
  - 3.0% of rows publish a power no charge point can have (771 rows at 7,360 —
    watts in a kilowatt column — and 5,315 at ≤ 0). Those are counted in an
    explicit *puissance non exploitable* band rather than rescaled by a guess
    that would turn a real 600 kW bank into 0.6 kW.
  - `consolidated_is_lon_lat_correct` is False for two different reasons. False
    with no verified commune (80,545 rows) means *unverifiable* and is kept;
    False with one (5,361 rows) means the position contradicts its own commune
    and is withheld and counted. Reading the flag as one thing would either
    discard a third of France or leave a Gironde site drawn south of Madagascar.
  - Booleans arrive in nine forms including `"False"`, which JavaScript coerces
    to `true` — that alone would report every paid site as free.
  - Some publishers ship Mac-Roman accents decoded as Latin-1, which would
    split one legend row into four.

- **Bornes IRVE** gained its middle regime — the *maillage*. The layer now
  answers at three scales instead of two: the 96 départements while the whole
  country is in view, real site positions thinned onto a 30 × 20 grid once
  France is cropped, and every site with full detail over a city. Only one is
  ever drawn, and each carries its own legend.
- The thinning is spatial, not by rank: every occupied grid cell gets a dot
  before any cell gets a second, so the Massif Central stays visible as sparse
  rather than vanishing. Taking the biggest N instead would have collapsed
  France to a dozen conurbations.
- And each cell is represented by its most common band rather than its biggest
  site. Picking the largest drew **46.2% of the dots as high-power DC when
  12.2% of the sites in view were** — the biggest site in a rural cell is the
  motorway bank — which made the map say France runs on 300 kW chargers when
  it runs on 22 kW ones. The modal rule brings that to 8.7% against 12.2%
  true. The residual (`normale` at ~46% against 36%) is stated in the legend
  rather than hidden.
- The national point set is served once (`/api/irve-fr/mesh`, 39 579 tuples,
  0.9 MB, cached a day) and picked in the client, so panning the maillage
  costs no round trip.
- The layer's share-link token is **`8`**, not the `l` this work was originally
  written against: `l` went to **Centrales EDF** while the branch sat unmerged,
  and two layers on one token is a share link that silently enables the wrong
  one. Links written before this lands never carried an IRVE token at all, so
  nothing in the wild changes meaning.

- **Clicking a parcel now answers what is on it, not only where it is.** The
  card leads with the **address** (Base Adresse Nationale, keyless, Licence
  Ouverte 2.0) and carries **what is built there** from IGN BD TOPO — the
  building count, their footprint, the share of the parcel they cover, the
  tallest, the storeys, the dwellings and the dominant use — plus the parcel's
  own longest dimension. `24 Rue Paul Valéry 75116 Paris · 1 bâtiment · 1 026 m²
  au sol · 83 % de la parcelle · R+7 · 25 logements`.
  - **Neither join is published, and both lines say so.** BD TOPO and the PCI
    are two products with two lineages and no key between them, so a building
    belongs to the parcel its footprint centre falls on — a stated rule the card
    names, wrong in both directions at a boundary. BAN answers with the NEAREST
    address point, so the distance it publishes is printed beside the address
    past 10 m and the answer is dropped entirely past 60 m: on a card whose
    subject is which piece of ground you are looking at, a confidently wrong
    address does more damage than a missing line.
  - **A building near a tile edge is in both tiles.** Measured over Paris 16e: a
    naive join of two z15 tiles reported 25 buildings on a parcel that has 14,
    with one identifier appearing three times at 2 983, 13 and 5 042 m². Vector
    tiles carry a buffer. Deduplicating on `cleabs` — present on 100% of the
    1 202 features in a sampled tile — is the difference between 89% built and
    56%.
  - Both lookups run only on a click, are memoised per parcel, and fail as
    absences: the cadastre's own card is complete and correct without either.

### Fixed

- **Clicking a parcel highlighted a shape somewhere else.** Selection asked
  Cesium what was under the cursor, and `scene.pick` against ground-
  classification geometry answers with whichever shadow volume the ray enters
  first — which at the grazing angles this globe is normally flown at is not
  reliably the parcel visible under the pointer. The polygons are already in
  memory, so a click is now resolved against them directly: exact, independent
  of the classification pass, and testable without WebGL. Clicking a courtyard
  or a street selects nothing, which is the honest answer — the gaps in this
  layer are the public domain, and answering with the nearest parcel would
  invent one where France publishes none.
- **A pan dropped the selection and left the card behind.** Rebuilding the
  records on a new viewport cleared `_selectedId` without clearing the overlay,
  so the card stayed on screen describing a parcel that was no longer drawn,
  no longer highlighted and no longer clickable. The selection is now matched
  back by IDU after a redraw, and cleared with the records when the parcel has
  genuinely left the box.
- **The layer would not load at street level on a tilted camera.** The viewport
  gate read the span of `computeViewRectangle`, which on a TILTED camera returns
  everything the lens can see down to the horizon — a statement about the pitch
  far more than about how close the operator is. Measured in the app at 240 m
  over Paris: 0.0038° of longitude looking straight down, 0.0084° at 45°, and
  **0.0397° at 25°** — the same altitude, a tenfold spread. This globe defaults
  to an oblique view, so the layer refused to draw while the operator stood in
  the street with the parcels in front of them, and the row told them to zoom in
  when they already had.
  - The gate is now the camera's **altitude** (≤ 1 500 m), which is stable under
    pitch, and the row says "Descends sous 1 500 m" rather than naming a span
    the operator cannot see.
  - The request is a ≤ 0.02° box anchored on the point the **middle of the
    screen** meets the globe, clipped to the view. Under a nadir camera the view
    is the smaller of the two and the box IS the view, so nothing off-screen is
    ever requested; under a tilt it is the near and middle ground around what is
    being looked at, and the far half of the screen — where a parcel is well
    under a pixel — is not asked for. Anchoring on the camera's own position
    instead would load the ground behind the operator's shoulder.
- **And the proxy then rejected its own client.** Because the anchored box is
  exactly the client ceiling on both axes above a few hundred metres,
  `snapBoxOutward` — which moves all four edges out by up to a full grid step —
  reliably pushed it past a proxy bound that only allowed one step of growth.
  The layer 400'd at 400 m, 800 m and 1 200 m over Paris while working at 240 m,
  which is the shape of a bug that a span-sized box had been hiding. The bound
  now allows two steps for the snap and a third for floating point.

Verified over Paris 16e on the oblique view that reported it: 2 393 parcelles at
239 m, 4 426 at 800 m, 3 736 at 1 400 m, and the guidance line above that.

- **The Événementiel-DIR road-events attribution was never rendered** — the
  same merge shape that erased the power grid's ODbL notice a week earlier.
  Two branches each appended a credit at the same point in `DATA_CREDITS`, and
  the three-way merge kept both bodies but lost the `},\n  {` between them, so
  `bison-fute-events` and `irve-charge-points` shared one object literal and the
  second `key`/`html` pair silently overwrote the first. The road events layer
  has been drawing Licence Ouverte data with no entry in the attribution
  popover. Both are now separate objects.
- **And the shape is now caught rather than found by accident.** Twice it took
  someone adding an unrelated credit next to it to notice, because every
  runtime invariant still holds: the array is well formed, every entry has a
  key, no key is duplicated — it is simply one entry shorter.
  `src/data/dataCredits.test.mjs` reads the source and asserts the number of
  `key:` and `html:` properties matches the array length, which is the only
  place the evidence survives.
### Fixed

- **234 road-status "segments" were points wearing a segment's shape.** Their
  referential row publishes a start equal to its end, and they were being written as
  four-number segments and handed to Cesium as zero-length ground polylines — geometry
  it cannot stroke. They are now written as single points, which is what makes the
  renderer draw them as the 25 m stub a positioned station with no extent deserves.
  The segment count falls from 842 to 608 and nothing is lost: the difference was never
  234 roads.
- **A rebuild of the road-status index reported Brittany as unlit.** The coverage table's
  `fromPointRepere` counted what a run had newly placed rather than what the file held,
  so the second build against an already-complete index reported zero for Nantes,
  Rennes, Saint-Brieuc and Lorient–Vannes on a day nothing about them had changed. It
  now counts from the committed record, and the assertion that guards those four cities
  survives a re-run.
- **One refused tile took the whole Bâti 3D layer down.** A city-sized viewport is 24–60
  separate requests to the Géoplateforme, a free service that rate-limits at 400 req/min
  and answers 5xx under load; they were gathered with `Promise.all`, so a single refusal
  rejected the entire load, blanked the buildings and put the layer into a 20 s→4 min
  backoff with fifty-nine good tiles in hand. This is why the layer failed to load on
  the hosted deployment and not on a laptop. A refusal is now per-tile: the squares that
  answered are drawn, the shortfall is counted, the row reads *"N tuiles BD TOPO refusées
  sur M — bâti incomplet, nouvelle tentative"*, and the layer asks again. Only every tile
  refusing is still a failure — there is nothing to draw then. A partial answer is marked
  DEGRADED and never passes as a whole city.
- **A school's name depended on how far you had zoomed.** The national *maillage* pack
  ships coordinates and not names on purpose — carrying them takes it from 1.66 MB to
  5.42 MB — so a dot clicked at region scale produced a card titled "Établissement" and
  an instruction to zoom in, while the same school two zoom steps closer was "Collège
  Jean Moulin". A click now asks the register for that one coordinate and the card
  becomes the full one, name included; the answer is remembered for the session, so
  re-clicking costs nothing. Where several UAIs share an address — 2,212 SEGPA and SEP
  sections nationally sit at their parent's coordinate — the dot's own level picks
  between them and the card says how many others are there.
- **DETECT described schools by their level or their roll, never by their name.** A
  callout read "412 élèves", which names nothing, or "École", of which a district has
  hundreds. It now reads the establishment's published name — "Collège Jean Moulin" —
  prefixed with its level only for the 2.6% of register names that do not already state
  one ("Lycée · Institution Saint-Pierre").
- **Deux satellites FIRMS sur trois disparaissaient les jours de grande activité, et la
  couche avait l'air en bonne santé.** `fires.push(...records)` passe un ARGUMENT par
  détection, et V8 refuse au-delà d'environ 124 300 (mesuré ici sur Node 26.0.0, le
  seuil exact dépendant de l'état de la pile). Un tirage `world/2` en rend ~131 000 pour
  NOAA20 et SNPP : les deux levaient `RangeError`, attrapé juste en dessous comme une
  panne d'amont, et seul NOAA21 — 114 000, sous la limite — survivait. Compte mondial
  mesuré en amont : **113 996 → 377 169**. La boucle passe par `appendAll`, et l'entrée
  `ok:true` n'est plus écrite qu'une fois les détections effectivement rangées : elle
  partait AVANT, donc une source qui échouait était listée deux fois, `ok:true` avec son
  vrai compte puis `ok:false`, et `/api/firms` annonçait des détections qu'il n'avait
  pas gardées. Correctif d'amont repris et étendu (bilawalsidhu/gods-eye-view#93).
- **Six plafonds de réponse comptaient des caractères là où ils annonçaient des octets.**
  `body.length` compte des unités de code UTF-16 : trois octets d'euro en valent un, donc
  un corps non latin pouvait tenir à près du triple d'un plafond et le passer. Pire, le
  test arrivait APRÈS `await response.text()`, c'est-à-dire après l'allocation qu'il
  existe pour empêcher. Les six sites — GBFS, le lecteur partagé des six scans d'adresse
  (Géorisques, DVF, DPE, GPU, isochrones, IDFM), NDBC, et le repli non diffusé de CCTV —
  passent par `readResponseTextCapped`, qui refuse sur `Content-Length`, compte en octets
  pendant la lecture et annule le flux au dépassement. Il servait déjà 14 appels dans le
  même fichier. Il relâche aussi la socket quand il refuse sur l'en-tête, au lieu de la
  laisser ouverte jusqu'au GC. Le repli CCTV était une seconde implémentation presque
  identique de ce lecteur, portant le bug que la version partagée n'a pas ; il n'en est
  plus qu'un adaptateur.
- **Un tirage FIRMS n'avait aucun plafond du tout.** `res.text()` lisait le CSV mondial
  sans limite. Il est plafonné à 256 Mo — un ordre de grandeur au-dessus des ~13 Mo que
  pèsent 100 000 détections, donc il ne peut se déclencher que sur un amont qui a changé
  de forme.
- **Les paquets Natural Earth et quartiers chargeaient par deux chemins selon le
  runtime.** Une branche `isNode` importait dynamiquement `node:fs`, ce que Vite
  externalisait avec un avertissement à chaque build de production. L'attribut d'import
  fait le même travail dans les deux runtimes et la branche disparaît, avec un test de
  frontière qui empêche un import `node:` de revenir dans un module construit pour le
  navigateur. Correctif d'amont repris tel quel (bilawalsidhu/gods-eye-view#83).

### Security

- **Le proxy GBFS validait une URL, puis en récupérait une autre.** L'hôte, le chemin et
  le protocole étaient vérifiés sur l'URL demandée par le client — puis `fetch()` suivait
  les redirections tout seul. Un flux de la liste blanche répondant
  `302 Location: http://169.254.169.254/…` suffisait à faire récupérer cette adresse par
  le serveur et à en renvoyer le corps, tous les contrôles ayant déjà été dépensés. Le
  proxy suit désormais les redirections à la main, en réappliquant la liste blanche à
  chaque saut (`gbfsRedirectTarget`), avec trois sauts au maximum et une seule échéance
  pour toute la chaîne — un flux ne peut pas gagner du temps en rebondissant. Même
  posture que le proxy Radio Browser, qui refusait déjà les redirections.

### Changed

- **Un visiteur froid tirait 5,06 Mo de l'origine à chaque visite, et le cache de Cloudflare n'en gardait rien.** `vite preview` — ce que fait tourner un déploiement — code en dur `Cache-Control: no-cache` sur chaque fichier qu'il sert. Mesuré sur l'origine hébergée : `cf-cache-status: BYPASS` sur tous les assets, donc l'edge ne stockait rien et chaque première visite traversait le tunnel jusqu'à Paris, où que soit le lecteur. Deux familles d'URL sont pourtant immuables par construction et le disent désormais : `/assets/*`, dont Vite écrit le hash de contenu dans chaque nom, et le paquet Cesium. La liste est délibérément une allowlist courte plutôt qu'une exclusion — un futur asset reste non caché tant que personne n'y a réfléchi, jamais gelé un an par inadvertance. `index.html` garde son `no-cache` : c'est la carte qui mène des noms hashés au contenu, et une copie périmée épinglerait un visiteur sur un bundle qui n'existe plus.
- **Le chemin Cesium porte sa version, sans quoi la promesse d'un an aurait été un mensonge.** `vite-plugin-cesium` recopie la sortie de build du moteur telle quelle sous une base unique, et aucun de ces noms de fichiers ne porte de hash : `/cesium/Cesium.js` désignait donc 6 Mo différents après chaque montée de version. Le répertoire est maintenant `/cesium-<version>/`, donc l'URL change quand ses octets changent. Rien dans l'arbre n'écrit ce chemin en dur — le plugin définit `CESIUM_BASE_URL` pour le chargeur de Workers et d'Assets, monte la route de dev au même endroit, et écrit la balise qu'il injecte depuis la même valeur.
- **Le moteur Cesium ne bloque plus l'analyse du HTML.** Il était injecté comme script classique dans `<head>` : la plus grosse chose de la page — 1,63 Mo sur le fil, 6 Mo une fois analysés — et l'analyseur s'y arrêtait net, si bien que les 55 ko de balisage en dessous et la feuille de style derrière attendaient tout le téléchargement puis toute l'exécution. `defer` le place sur la même liste d'exécution-après-analyse que le bundle module, et cette liste respecte l'ordre du document : la balise injectée est au-dessus de `/assets/index-*.js`, donc `window.Cesium` est défini quand la première ligne de l'app le lit.
- **Les fichiers `.geojson` partaient non compressés, et c'était une histoire de plus au lieu de barre oblique.** mrmime les type `application/geo+json` et le filtre de compression de Vite teste `/text|javascript|\/json|xml/i` : `+json` n'est pas `/json`, donc le test échouait et le fichier sortait brut. Mesuré sur `departements.geojson` : **254 348 octets, puis 83 593** une fois relabellisé `application/json` — ce que ces fichiers sont, puisque rien d'autre que `JSON.parse` ne les lit. La même passe pose `Vary: Accept-Encoding`, que le middleware de compression n'annonçait jamais : sans conséquence tant que rien ne cache, mais avec un cache edge devant, c'est une invitation à servir un corps gzip à un client qui n'en a jamais demandé.
- **Le HUD tirait 1,77 Mo de grille pour corriger un chiffre, et c'était le plus gros objet expédié — plus gros que le moteur Cesium.** L'altitude que Cesium rapporte est ELLIPSOÏDALE, celle qu'un lecteur attend est au-dessus du niveau moyen des mers, et l'écart N vient de la grille EGM96 embarquée (2,77 Mo, 1,77 Mo sur le fil, à peine compressible). Le HUD étant visible par défaut, sa première tick de télémétrie traînait cette grille entière dans le démarrage de chaque visiteur. N arrive désormais de `/api/geoid`, une cellule grossière à la fois, calculé côté serveur par **le même paquet** : le nombre est identique au bit près, pour une cinquantaine d'octets. Mesuré sur sept démarrages à froid bridés : **5 187 ko → 3 359 ko d'octets depuis l'origine de l'app, soit −35 %**, une mesure sans bruit (5 187 exactement à chaque run). Le temps de démarrage ne bouge pas : ces 1,8 Mo se téléchargeaient en parallèle des tuiles sans rien bloquer — le gain est en octets et en egress, pas en vitesse.
- **La grille reste embarquée, parce que six modules de couches ne peuvent pas s'en passer.** `flights`, `militaryFlights`, `aisLiveVessels`, `bdtopoBuildings`, `terrainHeights` et `ignBilTerrain` la lisent en processus — le dernier fait des milliers de lookups SYNCHRONES par tuile de terrain, ce qu'aucun réseau ne peut servir. Ce qu'ils ont en commun : aucun n'existe avant que sa couche soit activée, c'est-à-dire exactement quand payer la grille est honnête. C'est pourquoi la retirer du HUD la retire du démarrage sans la retirer à personne. Le mode de défaillance du HUD est inchangé : un endpoint injoignable résout à `null`, `ellipsoidalToMslDisplayM` laisse passer la hauteur ellipsoïdale brute, et l'affichage est non corrigé plutôt que faux. En traversant une cellule, l'ancien N est conservé pendant que le nouveau arrive — les cellules voisines diffèrent de centimètres, alors que blanchir la valeur ferait sauter le chiffre de plusieurs dizaines de mètres le temps d'une tick, c'est-à-dire l'artefact même que ce datum existe pour supprimer.
- **Un vol de caméra coûtait 29 Mo de tuiles, pour raffiner des images destinées à être remplacées.** Cesium raffine le globe jusqu'à `maximumScreenSpaceError` à chaque image, y compris celles d'un vol : le vol d'intro descend quatre secondes à travers toute la pyramide de zoom au-dessus d'un seul point, donc le globe se raffinait à pleine finesse à chaque altitude traversée et jetait chaque niveau une image plus tard. Mesuré sur un démarrage à froid du build expédié : 178 tuiles OSM réparties de z1 à z17 et 190 tuiles de terrain de z0 à z14. La tolérance d'erreur est maintenant relâchée pendant que la caméra bouge et **rendue à l'identique dès qu'elle se pose** : la valeur au repos est celle que Cesium avait, capturée à l'installation et jamais supposée, donc ce gouverneur ne dégrade jamais une image fixe. Sur un vol de quatre secondes entre villes françaises, médiane de cinq vols : **826 requêtes / 29 Mo → 438 requêtes / 14,4 Mo**, des plages qui ne se recouvrent pas.
- **Sur un démarrage à froid, ce même gouverneur ne vaut que −2,7 %, et c'est la mesure qui compte.** Sur une fenêtre fixe de vingt secondes, une fois la caméra posée, la vue finale charge ses tuiles de toute façon : le gain porte sur le déplacement, pas sur l'arrivée. Un premier relevé isolé suggérait −35 % ; c'était un artefact de fenêtre de mesure, pas un résultat.
- **Une optimisation a été mesurée puis retirée.** Reporter le chargement de la grille EGM96 sur `requestIdleCallback` n'a rien donné — 5 352 ms contre 5 674 ms jusqu'à l'app prête, à l'intérieur d'une bande de bruit de ±900 ms. Décaler des octets ne les supprime pas. La piste est notée ici pour qu'elle ne soit pas retentée comme une évidence.


## [Unreleased] — 2026-08-31

### Added

- **Every live transit vehicle now carries the operator's own delay and
  disruption.** All 150 French vehicle-position feeds have a `TripUpdate`
  companion in their own dataset — and **63 of them ARE that companion**,
  publishing both in one protobuf body, so for those the delay is bytes already fetched rather than a
  second request. The dev-server proxy joins that prediction to the vehicle
  already on screen and sends four things with it: how far off the timetable the
  operator says the run is, whether the run has been **cancelled**, which of its
  remaining stops it will **skip**, and the operator's own sentence about its
  line from `Alert` (60 feeds carry them). The card reads *"🕘 9 min late"* and
  *"⚠ Bordeaux : travaux quai de Paludate (this line · detour)"*, the ambient
  contact label reads *"LN 15 +9m"*, and the control-panel row says *"1 network ·
  25 late"* without a click. Measured 2026-08-31 over the 30 largest live
  networks (1,865 vehicles): **67% of vehicles join a trip update** by `trip_id`,
  a further 2% only by vehicle id, and **38% end up with a deviation**. The gap
  is not a join failure — 17 of those 30 networks publish an absolute predicted
  `time` and never a `delay`, and converting one to the other needs the 223 MB
  `stop_times.txt` this project refuses to load. Those vehicles read *"run
  tracked · no delay published"* instead of showing zero, because a viewer must
  be able to tell "on time" from "nobody said".
- **A bus parked at its terminus is not fifty-six minutes early.** A vehicle
  waiting for a departure an hour away publishes a predicted arrival of "about
  now" against a scheduled arrival an hour ahead, and the deviation the operator
  computes is −3,361 s. Printed as punctuality that reads *56 minutes early*,
  which is not a thing a bus can be. `transitSchedule.awaitingDeparture` catches
  it — stopped at the first stop of its own run, ahead of schedule — and reports
  *"🕘 waiting to depart · due out 22:46"* instead. Over one Bordeaux viewport
  that is the difference between a summary claiming **28 early** and one saying
  **7 early, 13 waiting**. The rule is deliberately one-sided: a vehicle at its
  first stop running LATE has an overdue departure, which is real lateness.
- **Which resource carries a network's delays is now measured, not guessed.**
  The PAN catalog never says which trip-update resource pairs with which
  position feed, and a dataset can publish several of each — Astuce ships three
  position feeds and four trip-update feeds, one per operator, on interleaved
  ids. `scripts/build-pan-gtfs-rt-index.mjs` now probes the candidates and keeps
  the one whose trips actually **join this feed's own vehicles**, committing the
  measured join rate alongside. Adjacent resource ids are only the ranking hint:
  they pair TaM's urban and suburban feeds correctly and get Astuce wrong, where
  measurement scores the right body at 90%. Mean measured join rate across the
  79 networks with vehicles running at build time: **0.92**.
- **Aéroports: 7 464 places to land, France in full.** A new bundled layer
  draws the world's airports and aerodromes from **OurAirports**, the open
  catalogue its volunteer editors dedicate to the public domain. Cards carry the
  **ICAO and IATA codes**, the class, the **longest open runway** in metres with
  its surface family, and the commune — Roissy at 4 215 m of asphalt, an 82 m
  strip at La Tour-du-Pin, and 7 462 more in between. Bundled with the build, so
  it draws with **no key and no network**.

  The pack is a **selection, and the selection is asymmetric on purpose**:
  worldwide it is every large and medium airport plus everything that sells a
  scheduled seat (which is what keeps Monaco's heliport and the Greenland
  shuttles), while **France and the overseas territories carry the whole long
  tail** — 1 335 fields, altiports, hydrobases and one balloon field included.
  Shipped whole, the catalogue is 86 002 rows and roughly 25 MB of committed
  JSON, 23 196 of them heliports, and in France almost every one of those is a
  hospital landing pad with no ICAO code. The four clauses that decide what
  survives live in `src/data/airportsPack.js` — the same module the layer reads
  back when it writes a card, so the build and the globe cannot disagree about a
  field — and `airports/README.md` states the limit plainly: a small airfield
  missing outside France was **not selected**, and is not evidence of an empty
  sky.

  **Importance is a map channel, not a footnote.** Seven thousand identical dots
  is a wall, and this pack is the opposite of uniform. Two independent fields
  decide how much an airfield matters — OurAirports' editorial **size** class,
  and the hard fact of whether a **timetabled service** calls there — so
  crossing them gives four tiers: **Grand aéroport** (1 172), **Aéroport de
  ligne** (3 175), **Aéroport sans ligne** (1 991) and **Aérodrome & aéroclub**
  (1 126, all of them French, because the clause that admits them is). The tier
  is decided once and then drives everything: the dot size (14 → 6 px), the
  colour ramp, the label ladder, the legend, and **how far out the card stays
  readable** (14 000 km → 200 km). That last channel is the one that fixed the
  real problem: over Île-de-France the shared label grid was awarding fifteen
  cells to aéroclubs and three to Roissy, Orly and Le Bourget, because cells are
  awarded *locally* and a grass strip with no competition always wins its own.
  Priority cannot fix that; range can. The marker is always drawn — only its
  name waits until you come closer.

  Four chips on the layer row cut to the tier you want — `TOUS`, `AÉROPORTS`
  (drops the aéroclubs), `LIGNES` (only what a ticket is sold to), `GRANDS`.
  They are runtime params, **not** share-link state, and the layer keeps
  reporting all 7 464 features while a floor is on: a chip hides markers without
  losing them, the same contract the hydro layer's `floorKw` already follows.
  The legend counts what is **drawn**, not what is loaded, so a hidden tier
  reads 0 and says how many it is holding back rather than quietly overstating
  the picture. The grading itself is generic — `createLocalGeoJsonLayer` now
  takes an optional group/style/filter/legend contract, and the three other
  bundled packs are untouched by it.

  Three values in the pack are easy to misread and are labelled rather than
  cleaned up. `runways.count` counts upstream runway *records*, helicopter lanes
  included — Charles de Gaulle reports 5, of which four are its paved runways.
  `type` is OurAirports' editorial **size** bucket and does **not** map onto the
  French regulatory ladder. And `runways.surface` is a three-value family
  (`revêtue` / `non revêtue` / `eau`) collapsed from 557 free-text spellings
  across 48 203 runways; 22% of features carry no surface at all rather than a
  guess.

- **Click a live bus and see the line it is running.** Selecting a vehicle in
  **Transit FR** now draws its **route trace on the ground in the operator's own
  colour**, marks **every stop of the run it is on**, and adds to the card the
  line's public name, the stop it is heading for with a countdown and schedule
  deviation, and its terminus. Bordeaux's Lianes 35 draws as a 32 km loop with
  its 82 stops and reads *"▸ Avenue de l'Europe · due · 5 min late / ⇥ Gare
  Saint-Jean · 67 stops"*. Escape puts it all away again.
- **The two halves of that answer come from two feeds, and degrade separately.**
  The **trace, the line's name and its colour** come from the network's static
  GTFS — through the PAN's own **GeoJSON conversion** of it, so `shapes.txt`
  (36.7 MB compressed for Normandie) is never downloaded; the **ordered stops
  and their predicted times** come from the network's live **GTFS-RT
  TripUpdates** feed, which every one of the 142 datasets publishing vehicle
  positions also publishes. A network with no usable trip update still gets its
  line drawn, from `route_id` alone, and the card says the stops are not listed.
- **Which of a line's traces the run is on is measured, not guessed.** A French
  line publishes several shape variants and the conversion drops `shape_id`, so
  the layer picks the variant that carries **every one of the trip's own stops**
  — measured against all 897 of TBM's running trips on 2026-08-31, all 897
  matched at a median stop-to-trace offset of 3 m. When no variant fits, the
  **whole line** is drawn instead of one run of it and the card says so.
- **`npm run transit:static`** builds `config/pan_gtfs_static.json` (196 KB,
  URLs only): for each of the 148 queryable vehicle feeds, its TripUpdates
  sibling and its static GTFS's GeoJSON conversion. Geometry itself is fetched
  on demand and cached under `.gev-cache/pan-gtfs-geo/` — a first click on a
  network costs 0.87 s, every later one 18 ms.
- **A new layer: the State's own traffic sensors on the French national road
  network.** `Road Status FR` (`road-status-fr`) draws **830 segments, 918 km**
  of the non-conceded RRN, coloured every 60–360 s by the sixteen DIR
  traffic-management centres' own DATEX II `trafficStatusValue`, and carries the
  one measurement TomTom has no equivalent of at any price: a **vehicle count**
  — veh/h and average km/h per station, from Bison Futé's six-minute national
  snapshot. Keyless and Licence Ouverte 2.0, so on a build with no
  `TOMTOM_API_KEY` — where the traffic layer runs its simulation — this is the
  only measured congestion data on the globe. It is brightest exactly where
  `Transit FR` is dark: Marseille (186 segments), Toulouse (127), Lyon (106) and
  Saint-Étienne (100) publish no live bus at all.
- **The geometry is built offline, because the published referential is three
  traps.** `npm run road-status:index` commits
  `config/datex_traficolor_sites.json` (178 KB, 1 195 sites, 832 located).
  `refDir.csv` is in **Lambert-93**, so `scripts/lib/lambert93.mjs` reprojects
  it — deriving the projection constants from its defining parameters and
  asserting them against IGN's published NTG_71 values rather than pasting
  numbers a typo would turn into a silent kilometre. It is **regenerated every
  six-minute cycle with a moving row set** (1 197 stations in one cycle, 1 192
  in the next), so the build UNIONS successive cycles instead of trusting one.
  And it **declares twenty columns while publishing nineteen** on every row, so
  the parser reads positionally: a header-zipped read puts `nb_voies` in the
  easting and makes most of the network look unlocatable, which it is not.
- **Two different kinds of empty, kept apart.** Île-de-France has no publisher
  at all — the DIRIF appears in neither publication, verified three ways — while
  Lille, Nantes, Rennes, Saint-Brieuc, Lorient–Vannes and Nancy–Metz publish a
  live colour for **1 046 sites whose position nobody publishes**. A viewport
  over Lille now reads "357 live road states published under site ids that are
  in no national referential row" instead of a blank that looks like a bug, and
  `roadStatusCoverage.test.mjs` cross-checks every such claim against the built
  index so a DIR that starts publishing coordinates fails the suite rather than
  leaving a city wrongly dark.
- **Nothing is inferred from the count.** A located station no traffic centre
  watches stays grey and reads `Not reported` rather than being folded into free
  flow; where two centres report one site the WORSE state wins; flow and speed
  are labelled **6-min average**, never as an instantaneous reading; and a
  station that counted nothing says so instead of printing "0 km/h" — 114 of
  1 192 stations at 22:30 CEST, which is a fact about the hour, not a jam.
  Proven end-to-end by `npm run qa:road-status-fr` (18 checks) and 44 new unit
  tests.
- **Live French transit vehicles now say what they ARE.** GTFS-Realtime carries
  no vehicle class, so `npm run transit:route-types` joins each network's static
  GTFS `route_type` and commits `config/pan_route_types.json` — 147 feeds, 7,044
  routes, 195 KB. It reads **one member** out of each remote archive
  (`routes.txt`, 8.7 KB inside Bordeaux TBM's 26.7 MB / 250 MB-expanded feed)
  via HTTP range requests where the publisher allows them, so the national build
  transfers ~136 MB instead of ~1.5 GB. A Bordeaux viewport now separates its
  **67 trams and 3 Garonne river shuttles from its 358 buses**, coloured and
  labelled per class. Measured 2026-08-31 the join types **92.7% of the national
  live fleet**; the rest keep a neutral glyph and read `Type unknown` rather than
  borrowing their network's service class, which is a different question.
- **Transit vehicles are drawn as vehicles.** Each class now renders with its
  **Material Symbol** (Apache-2.0, vendored path by path under
  `licenses/material-symbols/`): a bus with a windscreen and headlights, a tram
  with its pantograph, a river shuttle as a boat, a métro, a funicular, a cable
  car. An earlier pass drew hand-made plan-view silhouettes and they were
  internally consistent and unrecognisable — recognition beats invention. The
  icons are FRONT views and so are never rotated; the operator's bearing is
  drawn instead as a small wedge that ORBITS the icon on its own billboard, so
  a bus stays a bus while still showing which way it is going. A vehicle whose
  feed publishes no bearing has no wedge, which is the same statement the bare
  disc used to make.
- **The road layer reaches metro altitude.** `trafficBounds.ROAD_FETCH_TIERS`
  replaces one fixed 0.05° fetch box with three altitude bands, the coarsest
  drawing arterials across a **0.30° (~33 km) box up to 30 km** — where it used
  to switch off at 8 km. Animated road traffic and the live transit fleet can
  finally share a frame over a whole French métropole: measured over Bordeaux,
  1,605 road dots and 356 live vehicles at once. The coarse band is cheaper than
  the street band it sits above (1,929 ways vs 3,701). Two new scene recipes,
  **Bordeaux Transport Pulse** and **France Transit Showcase**, are written
  against those bands.
- **The layer says where it has nothing, and why.** `src/data/transitCoverage.js`
  records the measured French coverage map — Paris intra-muros, Lyon, Marseille,
  Lille and Strasbourg had **zero** live vehicles at a Monday peak on 2026-08-31,
  because Île-de-France Mobilités publishes no GTFS-Realtime at all, Marseille
  publishes alerts only and Tisséo trip updates only. An empty viewport there now
  names the publisher and points at the nearest city that works, instead of
  reading "no PAN feed covers this view" and looking like a bug. A unit test
  cross-checks every "dark" claim against the shipped feed index, so an operator
  that starts publishing breaks the build.
- **The shipped PAN index deduplicates and quarantines itself.** Some networks
  publish one body under two resource ids — Kicéo's twin returned the same 59
  vehicles, drawn twice. `src/data/panFeedHealth.js` finds candidates by
  positional fingerprint and confirms them on a second probe **by roster only**,
  because the fleet moves between probes. A run of failed probes takes a feed out
  of viewport selection without deleting it, and any success revives it.
  `/api/transit-fr/feeds` now reports shipped and queryable counts side by side.

- **Événements routiers (FR): what the road operators themselves declared.** A
  new layer in **MOBILITÉ TERRESTRE**, keyless, Licence Ouverte 2.0, through a
  new `/api/bison-fute` proxy. It draws `Événementiel-DIR` — the national DATEX
  II aggregate every Direction interdépartementale des routes publishes its
  event log into. On the snapshot it was built against that was **286 situations
  holding 600 records**: nine accidents, one queue, 48 obstructions, 184
  roadworks orders, four closures and the diversions posted around them, across
  eight categories with their own legend.

  It is the companion to **Road Status FR**, which landed the same week and
  reads this publisher's OTHER product: that layer draws how the network is
  *flowing* (Traficolor status, veh/h, km/h), this one draws what has been
  *declared to have happened on it*. Neither reads the other's feed.

  Three decisions are the layer:

  - **One situation, one marker.** DATEX II nests up to twelve records inside a
    single situation — the accident, the two lanes it blocked, the four exits
    now closed. Drawing them all would put one crash on the map twelve times,
    so the CAUSE is drawn and the consequences are counted on its card
    (`+ 5 déviations`). An accident outranks the lane closure it caused; a
    diversion only wins when a situation is nothing but diversions.
  - **Planned is not happening.** 68 of the 286 had not started yet — works
    ordered for October. They are hidden by default, drawn dimmer and smaller
    under the `+ À venir` chip, and a globe that painted next month's roadworks
    over tonight's traffic would be saying something false about now.
  - **Ended means ended.** A rockfall opened on 31 January, cleared in March,
    and published with **no end time at all** — only the operator's lifecycle
    flag says it is over. Read on its validity window it has been blocking the
    N20 for seven months. The flag wins.

  The layer covers the **réseau routier national non concédé** and says so. The
  conceded motorways — the whole ASF/APRR/Sanef network — are not in this feed
  at all; Bison Futé serves them under the credentialed *Action b* / *Action c*
  licences, and their absence is a property of the source rather than a gap the
  layer hides. Two further caveats are stated rather than hidden: a `Linear`
  event publishes only its two endpoints, so a segment is the straight chord
  between them (median 1.77 km on the capture; the card says so past 10 km), and
  records the feed marks `probable` or `riskOf` are labelled unconfirmed.

  Under the hood: `bisonFuteFeed.js` holds a ~90-line DATEX II reader (no new
  dependency), the situation classifier and the primacy ordering, pinned by 17
  unit tests against a real captured document — including the rockfall with no
  end time and the situation whose internal operator notes must not reach a
  public globe. The proxy refreshes with `If-None-Match`: the origin serves ETag
  and gzip (3.3 MB → 165 KB) and answers a conditional GET with a 304, which is
  what makes a five-minute poll of a 3.3 MB document affordable.
  `npm run qa:bison-fute` proves the rest in a real browser.

- **Every data layer now knows what it is.** A new `src/data/layerTaxonomy.js`
  gives all 28 registered layers a category — **AIR & ESPACE**, **DÉFENSE**,
  **MARITIME**, **MOBILITÉ TERRESTRE**, **ÉNERGIE**, **RISQUES &
  ENVIRONNEMENT**, **RÉSEAUX & CAPTEURS** — plus three facets: coverage
  (`global` / `fr` / `us` / `cities`), auth (`none` / `free-key` / `metered`)
  and cadence (`live` / `periodic` / `static`). The table is cross-checked
  against the registered layer set in BOTH directions at import, so adding a
  layer without categorizing it is a boot failure rather than a row that
  quietly lands in whatever group it was appended next to.
  `DataLayerManager.getAll()` now reports `category`, `kind` and `tags`, and
  the one registered layer that loads nothing of its own — the CONTACTS
  coordinator — is marked `kind: 'coordinator'` so it can never occupy a row or
  inflate a group count. **Nothing changes on screen yet**: the DATA LAYERS
  panel still renders its flat list. This is the data the grouped panel reads.
- **Seven more French cities on the LOCATION tray**, five landmarks each —
  Marseille (Notre-Dame de la Garde, Vieux-Port, MuCEM, Château d'If,
  Vélodrome), Lyon (Fourvière, Bellecour, Confluences, Part-Dieu, Saint-Jean),
  Toulouse (Capitole, Saint-Sernin, Pont Neuf, Jacobins, Cité de l'Espace),
  Nice, Nantes, Montpellier and Strasbourg (cathédrale, Petite France,
  Parlement européen).

### Changed

- **The globe opens on Paris.** A visit carrying no share link now starts over
  the Eiffel Tower at 600 m, framed toward the Trocadéro, instead of Austin.
  The LOCATION tray offers the eight largest French communes by population —
  Paris, Marseille, Lyon, Toulouse, Nice, Nantes, Montpellier, Strasbourg — in
  that order. The cities that left the tray did **not** leave the app: Austin,
  San Francisco, New York, Tokyo, London, Dubai and Washington stay reachable
  by search and by voice. Deleting them would have stranded the seeded CCTV
  cameras, which anchor to a city plus a landmark *index* — a regression test
  now walks that seed table and fails if any camera loses the landmark it was
  calibrated against.

### Fixed

- **The power grid's OpenStreetMap attribution was never rendered.** Its entry
  in `DATA_CREDITS` was missing its object boundary, so `power-grid-osm` and
  `rte-actual-generation` shared one object literal and the second `key`/`html`
  pair silently overwrote the first — the ODbL credit for a layer that draws
  volunteer-mapped geometry simply did not appear in the Data attribution
  popover. Both entries are now separate objects, and 42 credits are registered
  where 41 were. Found while adding the Bison Futé credit next to it.

- **`npm run qa:traffic` could not boot at all.** It waited on
  `window.__godsEyeView` with puppeteer's default animation-frame polling, and
  software-rendered headless WebGL stalls the rAF loop — so the harness timed
  out after 60 s on an app that had booted perfectly well, reporting `0 passed,
  0 failed`. It now polls on an interval, the way `qa-transit-fr.mjs` already
  documented, and its screenshots are best-effort: a lost frame capture used to
  abort a run whose assertions had all passed. The traffic proof runs end to
  end again — 11 assertions, live and keyless.

## [Unreleased] — 2026-08-28

### Added

- **Petite hydro: the markers were half a kilometre underground, and it showed
  as drift.** Reported from the map: pan the camera and the dots appeared to
  slide over a map that was standing still — the Espalungue marker would not sit
  on its building, and the offset changed direction between two screenshots of
  the same place.

  It was not a data error. Espalungue's coordinate is **6 m** from IGN's
  building footprint. The markers were being drawn at **ellipsoidal height 0**
  while the ground in the Ossau valley is at **556 m**, so every dot was 556 m
  below the terrain it was meant to stand on — 840 m at Grand-Maison. A point
  under the surface is not merely low: its screen position is offset from the
  surface point above it by `depth × tan(angle between the view ray and the
  local vertical)`, which is zero at the centre of a nadir view and reaches
  about **320 m** at the rim of a 60° field of view. That angle changes as the
  camera moves, so the marker slides.

  Markers are now clamped onto the terrain, the way `rteGeneration.js` already
  clamps its station rings. The synchronous half — reading a floor already in
  cache — is free and always applies; the terrain fetch is bounded to the
  markers actually on screen, capped at 250, and skipped entirely above 200 km
  of camera height where the offset is under two pixels. Positions are updated
  in place on the existing primitives rather than by repainting 2 742 points.

  The clamp follows **both** `camera.moveEnd` and `camera.changed`, because
  neither covers the other: `moveEnd` does not fire when the camera is placed
  programmatically, which is exactly what a share link does, so on its own it
  would have left a link that opens straight into a valley with every marker
  still buried.

### Fixed

- **Bâti 3D no longer floats over Lyon's hillsides.** Reported from a
  Croix-Rousse view where whole blocks hung in the air while the next block sat
  correctly on the ground — and that pattern was the diagnosis. The layer
  re-anchors IGN's surveyed floor altitudes onto the surface the globe draws by
  taking the median difference between the two over a ~1.1 km cell, but it
  sampled that surface **once per cell, at the cell centre**, and differenced
  that single height against each building's own floor. On flat ground the
  result is the datum error, which is what the correction is for. On a slope it
  is the *relief between the cell centre and the building* — 30 to 60 m across a
  0.01° cell on the Croix-Rousse — and every building in the cell was lifted by
  it, uniformly, which is why the artefact came in cell-shaped blocks.
  The surface is now measured under each building with `globe.getHeight` — the
  terrain triangles already resident on screen, one synchronous read per volume
  and no network at all. The per-building sampling the first version priced as
  unaffordable (6 400 DEM lookups per viewport) costs nothing, because it never
  touches the DEM; the coarse grid is now only consulted when the camera has
  teleported and no terrain is resident yet. Two smaller corrections came with
  it: the surveyed ground compared against that height is now the middle of the
  footprint (`altitude_minimale_sol` is its LOW corner, and IGN publishes
  `altitude_maximale_sol` beside it — median drop 1.9 m, up to 13 m), which
  stops half of each building's own slope being read as terrain error; and what
  the cell median still cannot fix is absorbed by GROWING each volume — base
  down where the mesh is low, roof up where it is high, capped at 60 m.
  **The correction only ever lengthens a volume, never moves it**, so the floor
  altitude on every card is still the one IGN published. The layer also reports
  the residual it had to absorb (median and worst 5%) rather than averaging it
  out of sight, and `npm run qa:bdtopo` now asserts that residual over
  Fourvière — a hill, chosen because the old sampling could not pass there.

- `qa-fr-hydro.mjs` now probes `/api/terrain/heights` and reports which checks a
  target cannot run, instead of failing them. `vite preview` serves `dist`
  without the dev-server API middlewares, so the ground clamp and the overlay
  paint checks are only meaningful against `npm run dev` — where they pass. An
  earlier note in this harness blamed SwiftShader for the empty overlay
  diagnostics; that was wrong, and the cause was the preview target.

- **Petite hydro now reads the Plan IGN, and 229 more plants have a place on
  the map.** Asked for better precision, and the suggestion was the right one:
  the Plan IGN draws France's power stations, and it draws them from **BD
  TOPO**, whose `zone_d_activite_ou_d_interet` layer carries 4 318 features
  tagged `nature = 'Centrale électrique'`. Three things make it the best
  positional evidence available. It is **the building** — median footprint span
  **32 m**, against an OpenStreetMap `type=site` relation that can be twelve
  kilometres wide. It **publishes its own error bar**, `precision_planimetrique`,
  3 m or better on 242 of the positions used here, and the card now prints it.
  And the join needs no guessing at all: BD TOPO publishes `insee_commune`, the
  same INSEE code ODRÉ prints on every register row.

  Used in two passes. **Refine:** a plant another tier had already identified is
  snapped onto the nearest footprint in its commune within 250 m — **360
  positions moved, a median of 12 m.** The radius is read off the measured
  distribution rather than chosen: agreement clusters tight below 250 m and the
  curve flattens after it. **Place:** a row nothing else could position takes a
  footprint when the toponym matches, or when the commune holds exactly one
  register row and exactly one free footprint. **765 → 998 plants placed**, and
  coverage below 4,5 MW roughly doubled — 50 % of the 1–4,5 MW band (was 38 %)
  and 19 % below 1 MW (was 11 %). The honest caveat is on the card: 86 of the
  229 new placements sit on a `Centrale électrique` whose kind IGN leaves blank,
  and where IGN did not say "hydroélectrique", the card says so.

- **Four plants were on the wrong continent, and the register said so itself.**
  Both the commune and the source substation are codes ODRÉ publishes, and
  OpenStreetMap publishes the substation code too as `ref:FR:RTE`. Across the
  378 RTE-connected rows OSM can check, the two agree to a median of 2,4 km and
  a p90 of 5,4 km; **the largest legitimate gap is 11 km, and then the next four
  are 6 717, 6 864, 7 263 and 8 945 km.** All four are metropolitan hydro plants
  filed under an overseas commune: the 30 MW **Lac d'Oô** — Luchon,
  Haute-Garonne — is published in **Guyane**, **Luz** in Martinique, **Motz** in
  Guadeloupe and **Pont-du-Loup** at La Réunion. For those the commune is simply
  the wrong field, so the substation wins and the plant is drawn where its own
  yard is. The register's commune is kept verbatim on the record and the card
  prints both claims: the reader is owed the contradiction, not a quiet edit.

- **Petite hydro: 167 plants were in the wrong place, including one in a
  forest.** Reported from the map: the Centrale du Hourat at Laruns was drawn
  2,7 km up the mountain, mid-forest, when it stands in the middle of the
  village beside the Arriussé. Two independent bugs, both mine, both now
  measured and pinned:

  **Overpass `center` on a relation is the centre of its BOUNDING BOX.**
  OpenStreetMap maps a large hydro scheme as one `type=site` relation covering
  the intake, the headrace tunnel, the penstock, the powerhouse and the
  tailrace — the Hourat's spans 6,0 km, Grand-Maison's 12,1 km, Montpezat's
  22,8 km — and the centre of that box is a point on **no object at all**.
  Measured on the first build: **167 of 722 OSM-positioned plants (23 %) sat at
  the centre of an object more than 500 m across, 99 of them more than 3 km.**
  The build now asks for `bb` instead of `center` so it can see the span,
  refuses anything wider than 500 m as a position, and snaps those to the
  `power=generator` elements inside — the generating hall. **127 plants moved,
  a median of 1,3 km and up to 7,5 km.** The Hourat now lands 47 m from 4 rue
  de Gerp, 64440 Laruns. What cannot be resolved is not guessed: it goes to its
  commune ring.

  **A prefix-shaped first word is not decoration.** The register writes
  `MIEGEH-CENTRALE HYDRAULIQUE DE MIEGEBAT-3`, so the build stripped any four to
  six uppercase characters followed by a hyphen. `GRAND` is five uppercase
  characters followed by a hyphen: **`GRAND-MAISON` became `MAISON`**, and
  France's largest hydro plant lost its join to EDF's own published coordinate.
  The decoration is now recognised only as a pair — prefix *and* trailing `-n` —
  which also spares the real register names `HYDR-AUZENE` and `COLY-LAMALETTE`.

  Three consequences worth naming. Cards now say **which object** the dot is —
  a published point, a mapped outline, a generating hall, or a connection yard —
  alongside how the plant was identified, and print how far a snapped position
  moved. A new last-resort tier places 49 plants on the **RTE switchyard whose
  `ref:FR:RTE` is the register's own `postesource`**, applied only to
  RTE-connected rows because on an Enedis row that substation serves a whole
  area and would stack a dozen producers on one pixel. And the 12 km commune
  ring is now re-tested on the FINAL position rather than on the candidate that
  was about to be thrown away. Coverage rose with the accuracy: **765 plants
  placed (was 761), 98 % of the fleet above 100 MW and 90 % of the 10–100 MW
  band.**

- **Petite hydro (FR): the other 2 686 hydroelectric plants.** A user went
  looking for the hydro installation at **Laruns**, in the
  Pyrénées-Atlantiques, and could not find it. Nothing was broken — there are
  *nine* plants in that commune (Miégebat 74 MW, Le Hourat 46,9 MW,
  Pont-de-Camps 39,4 MW, Artouste, Bious, Geteu, Fabrèges, Espalungue,
  Artouste-Lac, **223,9 MW between them**) and this globe could draw none of
  them: *Centrales EDF* covers EDF SA's own fleet and those nine are **SHEM's**,
  while *Groupes de prod* stops at 100 MW because that is RTE's publication
  floor. Two correct layers, and a whole valley in the gap. Measured against
  ODRÉ's national register, that gap is **2 742 installations and 26,02 GW**, of
  which the two existing layers between them reach 56.

  The new layer draws the register whole, down to a **40 kW mill at Monteils**,
  keyless, from a file shipped in the repo. It carries two kinds of marker and
  the difference between them is the point:

  - **A filled disc is a plant, where it is** — 761 of them, 23,4 GW, coloured
    by the register's own technology vocabulary (fil de l'eau, éclusée, lac,
    pompage-turbinage, hydrolien fluvial) and sized by installed power on a
    fourth-root ramp, because this fleet spans 40 kW to 1,69 GW and a
    square-root scale over that range either drowns the mills or paints
    Grand-Maison over a département.
  - **A hollow ring is a COMMUNE, not a plant** — 1 368 of them, standing for
    the 1 981 installations no source places. **The register publishes no
    coordinates at all**, only an INSEE code, and measured across the plants
    that *do* get a real position the commune centre sits a **median 3,0 km**
    from the actual powerhouse (p90 9,0 km) — in a Pyrenean valley, routinely a
    different river. So they are not pinned somewhere false; the ring says how
    many and how much, and never where.

  **Half the register is anonymised, and those cards are still full.** 1 357
  rows publish `Confidentiel` where a name belongs — small private plants whose
  operator is a person. They are neither dropped nor labelled "Confidentiel":
  the card leads with what the publisher *does* give, which for those rows is
  commune, installed power, technology, commissioning date, connection voltage,
  source substation, grid operator and EIC code at 95–100 %, plus — on 90 % of
  them — **the energy actually injected over the trailing twelve months**, which
  yields a capacity factor. An unnamed 3,9 MW plant at Licq-Athérey reads *3,9
  MW installés · 3,9 GWh injectés sur 12 mois glissants (12 %) · Fil de l'eau ·
  HTA, poste L.ATH, Enedis · en service depuis le 15/11/2007*.

  Three chips (**TOUT / ≥ 1 MW / ≥ 10 MW**) hide markers at runtime without
  touching the register behind them — the totals in the stats line stay put, and
  a ring clears a floor on its largest member, never on its commune total.
  Ambient labels follow the camera rather than the national capacity ranking, so
  zooming into the Ossau valley names Miégebat and Le Hourat instead of holding
  the label budget for Grand-Maison four hundred kilometres away.

  Four upstream traps are absorbed and documented rather than smoothed over:
  the register's **published zeros that mean "not declared"** (`debitmaximal` is
  zero on every single row in France, so it is not read at all); its internal
  name decoration (`MIEGEH-CENTRALE HYDRAULIQUE DE MIEGEBAT-3` is a poste-source
  code, a name and a revision number); **26 hydro plants published as
  `Photovoltaïque`**, 25 of them Corsica's real hydro fleet — Rizzanese 55 MW,
  Lugo-di-Nazza 43 MW, Castirla 28,5 MW, Tolla, Calacuccia, Ocana, Asco — which
  keep their disc and their published string on the card but are refused a hydro
  colour; and EDF's hydro file, where **`coordonnees_x_wgs` is the latitude**.
  Sources: ODRÉ (Licence Ouverte 2.0), EDF Open Data (Licence Ouverte 2.0),
  OpenStreetMap (**ODbL 1.0 — the share-alike travels with the shipped file**),
  geo.api.gouv.fr. Rebuild with `npm run hydro:registry -- --report`; browser
  proof in `npm run qa:fr-hydro`.

- **The app now starts with no key at all.** `git clone && npm i && npm run dev`
  boots to a working globe. Previously `src/main.js` threw before the viewer
  existed if `GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` was missing, so a fresh checkout without a
  billed Google account produced a dead page — even though the whole fallback
  path already existed downstream. The key is now optional and, when absent, is
  never published to the page: `Cesium.GoogleMaps.defaultApiKey` and
  `window.__GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY__` stay unset, so no request is fired with an
  undefined key. Google 3D reports **"Google Maps API key required for Google
  3D"** rather than a generic failure, and the Google-only viewport-places
  endpoint is not called at all. `scripts/dev-fresh.sh` warns and continues
  instead of exiting.
- **The search box works without a Google key.** Type a place, land on it — no
  credential involved. A keyless build now geocodes through `/api/geocode`,
  which answers from **OpenStreetMap (Nominatim)** worldwide and from the **IGN
  Géoplateforme** (BAN addresses and the IGN POI index) for the French
  addresses OSM has not mapped. Cities, régions, parks, streets and buildings
  are framed exactly as before — the camera work is unchanged, only the
  geocoder is new. Searching biases to what you are looking at, so "sixth
  street" over Austin is East 6th Street rather than a village in Uganda,
  while a place the whole world knows by that name still wins: "Toulouse" typed
  over Austin is the city in France, not the bistro down the road. Results are
  cached and the OpenStreetMap usage policy's one-request-per-second limit is
  respected for the whole app, so a search can take a couple of seconds the
  first time and is instant afterwards.
- **Two keyless France basemaps, from the IGN Géoplateforme.** **IGN Ortho**
  (BD ORTHO®, 20 cm aerial, z0-19) and **Plan IGN** (Plan IGN v2, z0-19) join
  the MAP SOURCE row, which is now six tiles on two rows. No key, no token, no
  account — `data.geopf.fr` serves WMTS with `access-control-allow-origin: *`,
  and IGN documents the WMTS endpoints as not rate-limited. Licence Ouverte
  2.0; the attribution popover names both products with their `cartes.gouv.fr`
  records and links IGN's table of aerial-survey dates, because an orthophoto
  mosaic has no single update date.
- Coverage is **metropolitan France and Corsica**, and the tray says so before
  you click: both tiles carry "IGN Ortho — metropolitan France only" in their
  tooltip and accessible name. Each IGN stack composites **over an OSM base
  layer** rather than replacing it, so the rest of the planet stays present —
  a rectangle-limited layer at index 0 would be Cesium's base layer, and Cesium
  smears a base layer's edge pixels across every tile outside its bounds.

- **Groupes de prod (FR) now draws the hydro fleet, and says what a negative
  reading really is.** The layer shipped in #14 against a hand-written fixture,
  because no RTE account was available to build it with. Run against the live
  resource for the first time, three of its claims turned out to be wrong and
  one gap turned out to be large.
  - **36% of the fleet was invisible.** RTE and the ODRÉ register cut the fleet
    at different granularities: the register carries one row per hydro PLANT,
    RTE publishes its turbine GROUPS under entirely different EIC codes. 55 of
    152 units — 1 914 MW — had no register code, so Grand'Maison, La Bâthie,
    Montézic, Revin, Super-Bissorte and thirteen more read as "RTE published
    nothing" while RTE was publishing them by the dozen. Those units now reach
    their station through a name match, which is weaker evidence than a
    published code and is labelled as such on the card. 148 of 152 units place;
    the four that do not are still counted and reported. Live stations went from
    43 to 60 of 108.
  - **A negative reading is usually a stopped unit, not a pump.** 24 units read
    negative and **fourteen were reactors** — Chooz 1 at −58 MW, Paluel 3 at
    −49. A shut-down reactor still runs its coolant pumps and instruments and
    buys that power off the grid: a stopped 1 500 MW machine is a ~50 MW load.
    Not one of the 28 pumped-storage units was pumping at that hour. The card
    and the legend say so now.
  - **RTE sends no installed capacity** (0 of 152 units), so the register's
    figure is the denominator behind every load percentage — and **no nulls**
    (0 of 6 992 rows), so the future-padding guard is defensive rather than
    observed. The module now marks each of its nine traps as MEASURED or
    DEFENSIVE instead of implying all were seen.
  - The test fixture is a **real capture** now, not a contract sketch.

- Added the **Groupes de prod (FR)** layer — France's power stations, unit by
  unit, at the output RTE last published for each one. 171 generating units of
  100 MW or more across 108 stations: 57 reactors for 63.0 GW, 56 hydro
  machines, 44 thermal groups, 9 offshore wind units, the Rance tidal barrage
  and two grid batteries. It completes the sentence the Réseau gaz layer's card
  has been leaving open — what those stations are producing *right now*, which
  éCO2mix only publishes as a national filière total.
  - **A ring is what a station can do; a disc is what it is doing.** The ring is
    sized by installed power on a √ ramp so area tracks megawatts, and the disc
    fills it at full load. A **faint empty ring** is a station RTE published
    nothing for. A **crisp empty ring** is one measured at zero — a reactor in
    outage, which is the most interesting state a reactor has and the one a
    `value || 0` guard silently erases. A **magenta disc** is a machine
    *consuming* the grid: Grand'Maison pumping 1 690 MW back up its mountain, or
    a battery charging.
  - **Click a station and the card is its units.** Each group with its own
    megawatts against its own nameplate, and a day of hourly history as a
    sparkline — where `·` is a published gap, `▁` is a measured zero, and `▽` is
    consumption. Not a smoothed line: the gaps are real and stay visible.
  - **It draws with no key at all.** The fleet is a shipped file built from
    ODRÉ's national register and positioned from EDF Open Data, OpenStreetMap
    and geo.api.gouv.fr, so a `git clone` puts all 108 stations, their names,
    their filières and 93.5 GW of installed capacity on the globe with zero
    credentials. A free RTE account (`RTE_CLIENT_ID` / `RTE_CLIENT_SECRET`
    from data.rte-france.com) only ever adds the number that moves — and the
    layer says so, in the readout and in the first legend row, instead of
    reporting zero.

- Four things the Groupes de prod layer refuses to do, each stated on screen:
  - **Draw a reactor.** Nobody publishes where an individual reactor building
    is — OpenStreetMap has zero `power=generator` + `generator:source=nuclear`
    elements over the whole of France — so Gravelines is one ring with six
    groups on its card, not six discs invented from a site outline.
  - **Hide where a ring came from.** RTE publishes no coordinate for any unit,
    so every position is derived from four published anchors and every card
    names its own: 69 stations sit on **EDF's own published coordinate for its
    own station**, 11 on an OpenStreetMap `power=plant` outline, 13 on the
    `ref:FR:RTE` switchyard their register entry names, and 15 at the centre of
    their commune — including four offshore wind farms whose rings are therefore
    on the beach, because nothing open publishes their footprint. A candidate
    more than 30 km from the commune centre is refused, and two anchors are
    never averaged into a third position nobody published. EDF outranks
    OpenStreetMap because the two agree to within 300 m on every reactor and
    every thermal site and diverge by up to 9.5 km on hydro, where a
    powerhouse, an intake and a dam share a name across a valley; every
    `edf-published` row records `supersededOsmKm` so that choice is auditable
    per station rather than asserted.
  - **Reconcile two capacities.** RTE's `installed_capacity` and the register's
    `puismaxinstallee` are different administrative numbers for the same
    machine; when they differ by a megawatt or more the card prints both.
  - **Quietly drop a unit.** A unit RTE reports that the shipped register has
    never heard of is counted in the readout with its megawatts, as *unplaced* —
    because there is nowhere honest to draw it.

- Eight upstream traps absorbed in the projection and pinned in the tests:
  **zero is a reading, not a gap** (`value || null` erases every reactor in
  outage and reads the fleet as 100% available); **the last row is the future**
  (the window is padded with unpublished `null` hours, so `values.at(-1)` reads
  the whole country as 0 MW — the same shape as éCO2mix's `prevision_j1`
  padding); **negative is pumping, not corruption**; `values` arrive out of
  chronological order; **one EIC code arrives in two envelopes** when the window
  spans a day boundary, so last-one-wins throws away half the history; RTE
  republishes an hour with a newer `updated_date`; the two installed capacities
  disagree; and RTE's fleet drifts from ODRÉ's register. On the register side:
  `puismaxinstallee` is published in **kilowatts** to three decimals, a 132 MW
  photovoltaic farm at Ajaccio is filed under `filiere: "Thermique non
  renouvelable"`, the Rance tidal barrage is named `CENTRALE HYDRAULIQUE`, and
  unit names arrive in four grammars with the article parked at the end
  (`TRICASTIN (LE)`).

- Added the **Centrales EDF** layer — where French electricity is physically
  made, from EDF's own three open datasets (hydraulic, nuclear, thermal),
  keyless under Licence Ouverte 2.0. 79 generating sites carrying 80 094 MW:
  18 nuclear sites (61 370 MW), 51 hydraulic plants (13 779 MW) and 10
  fossil-fired sites (4 945 MW). Each site is one disc whose **area** — not its
  radius — is its installed capacity, coloured by filière and labelled with
  what the object actually is in the publisher's own vocabulary:
  `GRAVELINES · 5 460 MW · 6 × REP 900`, `GRAND-MAISON · 1 714 MW ·
  Pompage mixte`, `CORDEMAIS · 1 160 MW · 2 × Charbon`. This is the structural
  half of the question **Mix élec** answers live: that layer says what is
  flowing right now, this one says what is built, and where.
- The layer is built around what these files do and do not say. **It is EDF's
  fleet, not France's** — the hydro file carries 51 of the 400+ installations
  EDF operates (those above 100 MW, plus those whose secondary reserve reaches
  20 MW), no CNR or SHEM hydro and no Engie or TotalEnergies CCGT; only nuclear
  is complete for the country. **There is no single "as of"**: nuclear is a
  vision consolidée au 31/12/2025 and the other two au 31/12/2023, so every
  site is stamped with its own file's date and the layer reports the range
  rather than presenting a total that never existed at one instant. **Installed
  capacity is not production**, and it is named that way everywhere. **A row is
  not a site**: the nuclear and thermal files publish one row per unit with the
  site's coordinate repeated on each, so six Gravelines reactors draw one
  marker and not six stacked on a pixel, while a hydro plant — published one
  row per plant, with no turbine count — reports no unit count rather than "1".
- **Five of these sites are also drawn by the Réseau gaz layer, and both are
  right.** That layer draws ODRÉ's register of the 14 centralised gas-fired
  stations whoever runs them; this one draws EDF's own fossil-fired file
  whatever it burns. The overlap is exactly the five EDF gas sites — Martigues,
  Bouchain, Blénod, Montereau, Gennevilliers — where the two publishers
  disagree slightly on capacity (585 against 575 MW at Bouchain). Nothing is
  de-duplicated: neither set contains the other, and hiding one figure would
  hide that they disagree.
- Two upstream traps are absorbed server-side in `edfPlantsFeed.js` and pinned
  against captured payloads: the hydro file publishes **`coordonnees_x_wgs` as
  the latitude** (read the usual way, Grand-Maison lands off Somalia) while the
  other two publish one `"lat, lon"` string, and
  `reserve_secondaire_maximale` is a **site figure repeated on every unit
  row**, so Cattenom offers 60 MW of reserve and not four times 60. 49 unit
  tests; `npm run qa:edf-plants` is the browser proof. Attribution registered
  in the Data attribution popover and DATA_SOURCES.md.

- Added the **Power Grid** layer — the wires themselves, from OpenStreetMap,
  keyless, loaded for the viewport you are looking at. The Mix élec and Réseau
  gaz layers came from ODRÉ; the electricity network's own geometry is the one
  part RTE publishes nothing for, so this is community mapping and the layer
  says so everywhere it can.
  - **Routes by voltage band** — a 400 kV backbone stroke is thicker and hotter
    than a 63 kV one, and the four bands (≥ 300 / 180–299 / 100–179 / 50–99 kV)
    are generic rather than French, so the same palette reads correctly on the
    British 400/275/132 and German 380/220/110 grids. Verified live against
    central London.
  - **The substations they land in**, sized by the same band, named on the globe
    when OSM names them — "Poste électrique de Villejust", 400/225/90 kV, RTE —
    and captioned with what OSM calls them: a poste source, a traction feed, or
    a role it never stated.
  - **The pylons**, but only below 0.25° of view, where a pylon is a thing
    rather than a dot. There are 11,670 of them in a 1.2° × 1.6° box; at that
    range they cost more bandwidth than the entire network they carry.
  - **Underground cable is dashed.** In Île-de-France a quarter of the mapped
    high-voltage network is `power=cable`, and drawing it like an overhead line
    would claim pylons that are not there.

- Four things the Power Grid layer refuses to do, each stated on screen:
  - **Draw a line at conductor height.** The wire hangs tens of metres up and
    OSM records that for a minority of pylons and for no line at all, so every
    route is a ground-clamped stroke of the mapped ROUTE — and every legend row
    says so, rather than lifting the network to a plausible-looking catenary.
  - **Guess a voltage.** Voltage is the filter because voltage is the evidence:
    a feature OSM has not given one is absent, not demoted. That filter is also
    what turns 619 raw "substations" in one Paris viewport — 404 of them
    street-corner cabinets and cadastre-imported building footprints — into the
    209 real high-voltage yards worth drawing.
  - **Call a stroke a line.** OSM splits one named liaison across dozens of
    ways, so the readout reports both: 1,386 strokes for 304 mapped routes, over
    Île-de-France.
  - **Imply a truncated view is a complete one.** Each class has its own element
    cap and reports its own truncation, and the readout says which one was cut
    and to zoom in. Above 0.8° of view the layer asks for nothing at all and
    says "zoom in" instead of drawing a partial grid that looks whole.

- Six upstream traps absorbed server-side and pinned against a captured Overpass
  response: **one shared element cap starves whatever Overpass emits last** (899
  pylons erased every line and substation in a Paris box, so each class now gets
  its own bounded output); `voltage` arrives as a `;` list carrying junk
  (`225000;0`, `225000;225000;225000;63000`) that `Number()` turns into NaN;
  `power=line` is not a synonym for high voltage (one is tagged 400 **volts**);
  RTE's own 225 kV yards are tagged `substation=industrial`, so the subtype is a
  caption and never a filter; a multipolygon substation carries no `lat`/`lon`
  at all, only a computed centre; and `power=cable` is the same network
  underground.


- **Shared mobility now says what an object is and who runs it, at the same
  time.** Two independent facts get two independent channels. **Shape** answers
  *what*: a bike, an e-bike, a kick scooter, a moped, a shared car and an
  unknown form factor each draw their own silhouette, so a Paris street stops
  being one undifferentiated cloud of dots. **Colour** answers *who*: every
  operator has its own hue, held nationwide — Lime is the same green in Lille
  as in Marseille, and Vélib', Voi, Dott, Pony, Bird, Citiz, Clem', YEGO,
  Cityscoot, Tier and Leo&Go are pinned so that no two of them can ever
  collide. The row legend now carries both keys: the silhouettes actually
  drawn, then the operators actually in view, named and counted.
- A **station keeps its fill for availability** — the one reading a person acts
  on — and wears its operator on the RING instead. The Bikeshare layer does the
  same, from the same registry, so over Paris a Vélib' dock and a Dott dock are
  tellable apart even though two different layers draw them. Bikeshare station
  dots grew from 4–12 px to 7–14 px so the ring cannot eat the fill.
- No French GBFS feed publishes a brand colour, and the layer does not pretend
  otherwise: the ~15 operators that run several French systems are pinned by
  hand, and every other network's hue is derived from its published title and
  labelled as derived in the legend tooltip. Two municipal networks can land on
  the same hue; the legend names them, and the names are what settle it. A
  selected vehicle's card now leads with its operator ("Lime E-bike"), and the
  detection readout says "PONY SCOOTER" rather than just "SCOOTER".

- Added the **Réseau gaz** layer — the French gas system, keyless. Three ODRÉ
  products drawn together because they only make sense next to each other: the
  **pipes**, the **inlets** and the **outlets**.
  - **36,106 km of high-pressure transmission trace**, clamped to the ground —
    NaTran (ex-GRTgaz) 31,420 km in violet, Teréga 4,686 km in orchid. Two
    companies, two colours, two length figures; a stroke of one is never
    chained onto a stroke of the other.
  - **850 renewable-methane injection points**, sized by the capacity each
    declares (16.3 TWh/an in total), and **14 centralised gas-fired power
    stations** sized by nameplate power (7,196 MW) — which is where a good part
    of that gas leaves the system as the `gaz` filière of the Mix élec layer.
  - It is a **published simplification, not a pipeline location**. Both
    operators publish their trace at about 250 m; nothing is densified,
    smoothed or re-routed, and every card says so.
  - It is **installed capacity, not live output**, and it says that too. What
    those 14 machines are producing right now is a national figure RTE does not
    break down per station without an API account.
  - **741 of the 850 injection points feed a network this layer does not
    draw** — the local distribution grid. They are drawn dimmer, counted on
    their own legend row, and no connector is ever drawn between a site and a
    pipe, because none of these files publishes that link.
- Six upstream traps are absorbed server-side and pinned against captured
  payloads:
  - The power-station file is **seven annual editions stacked in one table** —
    98 rows are 14 sites × 2019…2025. Summing the column reports 50,372 MW for
    a 7,196 MW fleet and stacks seven dots on each of 14 coordinates.
  - **The editions disagree**, and no endpoint promises an order. Landivisiau
    is `En projet` in 2019 and 2020 and `En service` from 2021; the export
    answers 2025 first, the records API answered 2023, 2022, 2025, 2021, 2024,
    2019, 2020. Newest edition wins, and the card names what the older ones
    claimed.
  - **Teréga's third ordinate is not a height** — it runs −705.5 m to
    +1,809.4 m over ground that is 0–1,500 m. Dropped, and the arity is checked
    per vertex because a flat lon/lat reader fed 3-tuples does not throw, it
    silently mis-plots the network.
  - One `geo_shape: null` row (which still carries a `geo_point_2d`) and eight
    `MultiLineString` rows in a file that is otherwise all `LineString`.
  - **Fifteen decimals on a ±250 m product.** Rounded to 5 (~1.1 m), which also
    reveals 165 published "lines" whose vertices are all one point.
  - **`site_ouvert` is the string `"False"`**, which JavaScript coerces to
    `true` — that alone would draw three closed sites, at zero size, out of a
    file titled *en service*.
- A pipeline drawn in any blue renders perfectly and reads as a river. The
  first version of this layer did exactly that — measured against the OSM
  basemap, its steel blue sat within 14/255 of the basemap's own water colour
  on every channel — so the two networks are violet and orchid, a unit test
  keeps all four channels apart, and the browser harness now counts the
  operator's own pixels with the trace shown against the same view with it
  hidden. Every structural check can pass while nobody can see the layer.

- Added the **Shared Mobility FR** layer — every French shared vehicle the
  Bikeshare layer does not already draw. From the same national access point as
  the transit layer, but its GBFS half: ~40,600 free-floating bikes, e-bikes,
  scooters and mopeds plus ~15,500 operator dock stations, across 135 systems,
  keyless, under per-operator Licence Ouverte 2.0 / ODbL 1.0. Loaded per
  viewport, coloured by vehicle kind with a live legend, and clicking one gives
  its battery range, its operator, and the age of that vehicle's own last
  report rather than the age of the poll.
- It is an inventory, not a track, and says so: GBFS never publishes a vehicle
  during a rental, so a vehicle being ridden is invisible and nothing is
  interpolated between two sightings. Freshness is uneven across operators
  (Lime ~50 s, Dott a median 8 minutes with a long tail) and is shown per
  object.
- Three redundancies are resolved before anything is drawn, each measured
  rather than assumed: the catalog's 165 resources collapse to 135 distinct
  systems (identity is the set of places a system reports, which catches
  Vélo'v published from two different domains where a URL comparison cannot);
  the four systems already in Bikeshare are excluded against that layer's live
  registry; and the 32,783 municipal parking-bay rows that free-floating
  operators republish as their own "stations" are merged out instead of being
  drawn once per operator. Every verdict is recorded in
  `config/gbfs_fr_systems.json` rather than silently applied.

- Added the **Mix élec** layer — France's live electricity mix, keyless. RTE's
  éCO2mix, republished by **ODRÉ** under Licence Ouverte 2.0 and refreshed every
  15 minutes, answers the question a national consumption gauge never can:
  *which regions power France, and which draw on it.* The 12 métropolitaines are
  painted by their own consumption-minus-generation balance — teal where a
  region produces a surplus, amber where it runs a deficit, opacity ramped by
  how large that imbalance is against the region's own load — so Auvergne-Rhône-
  Alpes and Normandie exporting hard while Île-de-France imports nearly its
  whole load is legible at a glance. The five commercial border balances are
  drawn as raised arcs whose arrow points the way the power travels, with the
  direction repeated in words on the label; a border at 0 MW is drawn as no arc
  at all. National load, gCO₂/kWh, low-carbon share and the net export figure
  are reported on the layer's row.
- The layer is built around what this dataset does and does not say. `ech_comm_*`
  is a **commercial nomination between market areas, not a cable**, so the arcs
  are anchored on country reference points rather than interconnection sites,
  and Allemagne + Belgique — published as one field — stays one arc labelled
  with both. The commercial balances do **not** sum to the physical one
  (measured: −2 893 against −3 633 MW), so both are reported, separately named.
  éCO2mix régional covers 12 regions: **Corse runs on its own system and is
  absent upstream**, so it is never painted rather than inheriting a neighbour's
  colour. RTE publishes no regional carbon content, so none is drawn.
  Attribution to éCO2mix / RTE via ODRÉ, with the dataset's own 15-minute
  timestamp, is registered in the Data attribution popover.
- Added the **Transit FR** layer — the first thing on this globe that moves on
  the ground. Live GTFS-Realtime vehicle positions from the French Point d'Accès
  National (`transport.data.gouv.fr`): buses, trams, metros and interurban
  coaches across ~150 networks, keyless, under per-feed Licence Ouverte 2.0 /
  ODbL 1.0. Vehicles are loaded for the viewport you are looking at (never
  nationally), colour-coded by the network's declared service class with a live
  legend, and clicking one raises its line, speed, bearing, stop status,
  occupancy and the age of the operator's own last fix. Glyphs **glide between
  two consecutive reported fixes** rather than jumping, so the scene renders up
  to one poll interval behind live and never extrapolates past what a feed
  actually said; a vehicle reporting no bearing is drawn as a disc, not a
  chevron pointing somewhere plausible. Above ~300 km the layer fetches nothing
  and says so.
- Coverage is honest about its own gaps: France's largest networks —
  Île-de-France, Lyon, Marseille, Strasbourg, Lille — publish no live vehicle
  positions at all (their SIRI feeds carry next-departure and disruption data,
  not coordinates), so a camera over central Paris reads "no PAN feed covers
  this view" instead of an empty map.
  Feed footprints are OBSERVED — the catalog publishes coverage as a name and
  never as geometry — and shipped in `config/pan_gtfs_rt_feeds.json`
  (`node scripts/build-pan-gtfs-rt-index.mjs` rebuilds it), so a cold start
  costs no probe sweep. Attribution to transport.data.gouv.fr and each
  publishing transport authority is registered in the Data attribution popover.
- Added a **Ports** layer: the NGA **World Port Index** (Pub. 150), 2,951 ports
  worldwide, bundled and keyless. Each port carries its country, region,
  UN/LOCODE, harbour size and type, shelter rating and water body. The
  publication is a U.S. Government work and therefore public domain, so unlike
  the TeleGeography cables it carries no commercial-use carve-out. Two traps in
  the source are handled rather than passed through: harbour depths are WPI
  *range bins*, not surveyed soundings, so they render as `~11 m channel
  (approx.)` and must not be used for navigation; and the size code `V` means
  *very small*, not "very large" — inverting that scale would promote three
  thousand fishing harbours to container terminals. Fields that are "unknown"
  for ~99% of rows (port security, VTS, TSS) and the max-vessel dimensions
  (present for 3% of rows, with impossible values) are dropped rather than
  rendered as data.
- Added a **Marine Buoys** layer: live sea state from the NOAA **National Data
  Buoy Center**, keyless, through the new `/api/ndbc` proxy (10-minute cache,
  disk-backed, serve-stale). One upstream fetch covers the globe. Buoys are
  colored on the WMO sea-state ladder by significant wave height, with period,
  direction, sea temperature and wind on the card. **The network is sparse and
  the layer shows it instead of papering over it:** only about a fifth of
  reporting stations carry a wave sensor, and one that does not renders neutral
  grey with the line omitted — never as a calm sea. A genuine `0.0 m` reading
  stays visually distinct from an absent one, and the control chip carries the
  measured/total split. Observations older than 12 hours are dropped, and an
  upstream outage notice is rejected rather than cached as an empty ocean.
- Added an opt-in **OpenStreetMap mapped-camera** source
  (`CCTV_OSM_CAMERAS_ENABLED=1`): publicly mapped surveillance-camera positions
  are loaded for the viewport you are looking at — plus a snapped margin, so
  panning re-uses the cached answer — and merged into the CCTV layer, anywhere
  in the world OSM has them. OSM maps where a camera is, never what it sees, so
  these cameras carry no feed and show a labeled Street View or
  `NO UPSTREAM CONFIGURED` frame, with tag-derived poses (bearing, tilt, mount
  height) marked `RAW PRIOR` and © OpenStreetMap contributors (ODbL)
  attribution registered the moment positions appear on the globe.
- Added the Métropole de Lyon "Caméras Web Criter" pack to the CCTV layer: the
  city's public traffic cameras, keyless, with their frames served live from the
  Grand Lyon open-data host. Cameras whose frames stop refreshing drop out of the
  catalog. Attribution to the Métropole de Lyon (Licence Ouverte 2.0) is
  registered in the Data attribution popover; `CCTV_LYON_ENABLED=0` disables the
  pack.
- Clicking the CCTV panel preview (or pressing Enter on it) now opens the frame
  full-screen at the publisher's own resolution — most public cameras publish
  1920x1080 into a 360px rail. Escape or the close button returns. The bar prints
  the frame's true pixel size, so an upscaled low-resolution camera never implies
  detail it does not have. Enlarging costs no extra request: the decoded frame is
  moved, not re-fetched.
- Lyon camera headings are now hand-derived from OpenStreetMap road geometry plus
  the published frames, and served as `CAL · CURATED`, instead of the arbitrary
  id-hash fallback the catalog's missing bearing would otherwise force. The 3D
  monitor plane now lands a median 6 m from the carriageway the camera watches,
  against 30 m for the hash it replaces. One camera keeps the fallback because it
  publishes a placeholder image, not a frame.
- Added three French national alert layers, all keyless: **Vigicrues** (337
  monitored river reaches coloured by the state's 4-level flood vigilance),
  **Hub'Eau Gauges** (the live river-sensor mesh beneath it, up to ~4,000
  stations sized by discharge) and **Météo-France Vigilance** (the 4-colour
  départemental weather warning across 9 phenomena). All three are Licence
  Ouverte.
- Added the `/api/vigicrues` and `/api/vigilance` dev-server proxies. Vigicrues
  publishes 2.2 MB with no gzip, no ETag and no Last-Modified against a map
  that changes twice a day, so the proxy splits it into a geometry document
  fetched once per session and a ~3 KB level document that is polled. The
  vigilance proxy prefers Météo-France's own keyless data.gouv.fr mirror and
  uses the authenticated API only when `METEOFRANCE_API_KEY` is set.
- Bundled the 96 metropolitan French département polygons (IGN ADMIN EXPRESS
  via france-geojson, Licence Ouverte) — the vigilance product carries colours
  but no geometry.
- Added honest aircraft identity narration: callsign, operator, registration,
  type, and route come only from selected-contact context, and missing operator,
  route, or type enrichment is named explicitly.
- Added local, publication-compatible copies of the two README PNGs, with source
  records and third-party-license boundaries in `docs/media/README.md`.
- Added regression coverage for aircraft identity narration and optional-key
  loading feedback.
- Added `scripts/lib/qa-first-run.mjs`: the QA fleet's shared handling of the
  first-run mission card. Every headless harness is a fresh browser session, so
  the card — which returns every fresh session by design — used to land on top
  of each new dataset's QA run, swallowing the clicks and pixels the harness was
  measuring, and each harness solved it again, differently. All 40 harnesses
  that drive the app now open their page with `newQaPage(browser)`, and
  `npm test` audits the fleet for it (`src/qaFirstRunSuppression.test.mjs`) so a
  new harness cannot forget. `scripts/qa-firstrun.mjs` is the one exemption —
  the card is what it tests. For QA by hand, `?welcome=0` on the app URL does
  the same thing, and `dev-fresh.sh` now prints that URL on startup.

### Changed

- First-run presentation now opens with Detection `DENSE` at 75%, `ELASTIC`
  allocation, Fade 7%, Outside 1%, scope feather 11%, and aircraft 3D models in
  `PROXIMITY`. Stored state and share links still override these baselines.
- The 17 selected README GIFs remain unchanged and are documented separately
  from the two owner-published PNGs.
- Bundled datacenter and dam snapshots now omit contact-oriented fields and
  note values containing email or phone identifiers. Feature geometry, names,
  operator/capacity/river metadata, counts, and ODbL terms are unchanged.
- Public documentation and the L9 release matrix no longer reference non-public
  planning material or repository history.
- Camera frames are now polled at the publisher's own cadence where it is known.
  The Grand Lyon feed republishes once a minute, so the active-camera poll drops
  from every 10 s to every 60 s — five of every six requests were re-fetching a
  picture the client already had. Packs that do not declare a cadence are
  unchanged.
- A provider "image unavailable" placeholder is no longer reported as a healthy
  snapshot. It is recognised by content hash, routed into the existing Street
  View / synthetic fallback chain, and named in the health line.
- An incomplete camera frame — a JPEG that ends before its scan data, which a
  browser paints as a thin strip of the top of the image — is likewise no longer
  reported as a healthy snapshot. It takes the same fallback chain, and the
  health line says the frame was incomplete.

### Fixed

- A retired or corrupted `map=` share parameter no longer raises a credential
  error about a source nobody asked for. An unrecognized id now resolves to the
  build's own default stack (`photoreal` when it is available, otherwise the
  first source that is), instead of unconditionally to `photoreal`.
- The `set_map_stack` voice tool and its toast quoted a hard-coded "requires a
  Cesium ion token" for **every** unavailable stack. They now quote the
  controller's own reason, so a keyless build stops sending operators after the
  wrong credential.
- The Data attribution popover listed the French transit source twice: a
  three-way merge of two branches that had each added it once left the entry
  duplicated verbatim. Credits are now registered by key, so that class of
  merge accident cannot reach the popover again.
- The full-resolution CCTV viewer no longer boxes every frame at 16:9. Its
  geometry rule was losing on CSS specificity to the panel's own `#cctv-frame`
  rule, so a camera with a different aspect ratio was letterboxed inside a shape
  it does not have.
- A missing optional FIRMS key no longer turns the complete Environmental
  mission into `LOAD FAILED`. The FIRMS row still reports `KEY REQUIRED`, while
  earthquakes continue to load. Real lifecycle and fetch failures retain
  failure priority.
- The mapped-installations layer retries after an unavailable request when it is
  enabled or the camera settles.
- Aircraft trails attach to the rendered aircraft transform and remain near the
  rear center across headings. Parked aircraft do not draw a moving head
  segment.
- Grounded aircraft keep validated floor evidence through temporary terrain
  outages and wait for measured photoreal-surface evidence before a 3D model
  takes over from its billboard.
- Cockpit altitude uses aviation MSL data rather than Cesium render height.

### Security

- Production transitive dependencies resolve to patched DOMPurify and
  protobufjs releases without changing the Cesium version or application APIs.
- Production dependency audit reports no known advisories; remaining audit
  findings are confined to development and QA tooling.

## [Unreleased] — 2026-08-23

### Added

- Added a first-run mission launcher for Contacts, Space Missions,
  Environmental, and manual exploration.
- Added terrain-validity gating and bounded last-known placement for grounded
  aircraft models.

### Changed

- Environmental consistently presents both earthquakes and NASA FIRMS fires,
  with honest optional-key degradation.
- The tracked aircraft trail acceptance bar is visual: roughly rear-center,
  stable across headings, with minor hull overlap allowed and no conspicuous
  top, bottom, or lateral projection.
