/**
 * Centrales EDF — where France's biggest generating capacity physically is.
 *
 * EDF publishes the location and installed power of its own generating fleet
 * as three open datasets — hydraulic, nuclear and fossil-fired — under Licence
 * Ouverte 2.0, keyless. Together they put 79 sites and 80 094 MW on the globe:
 * 18 nuclear sites carrying 61 370 MW, 51 hydro plants carrying 13 779 MW, and
 * 10 fossil-fired sites carrying 4 945 MW.
 *
 * This is the STRUCTURAL half of the question the Mix élec layer answers
 * dynamically. That layer says what is flowing through the grid right now;
 * this one says what is built, and where. A site here is a fixed object with a
 * nameplate, not a meter reading — nothing on this layer moves, and nothing on
 * it is a measurement of output.
 *
 * ── Where the data comes from ───────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Through the `/api/edf-plants` proxy, which fetches the three files plus
 * their three metadata descriptors and merges them into one document. The
 * upstream's coordinate shapes, row granularity and per-file vintages are
 * absorbed in `edfPlantsFeed.js`, under test against captured payloads.
 *
 * ── What is drawn, and why THAT ─────────────────────────────────────────────
 * One mark per SITE, its area proportional to installed capacity, labelled
 * with the site's name, its megawatts and — while the reader is looking at the
 * whole fleet — what it actually is: `6 réacteurs` at Gravelines,
 * `pompage-turbinage mixte` at Grand-Maison, `2 unités au charbon` at
 * Cordemais. Area rather than side carries the megawatts: a mark twice as wide
 * would otherwise claim four times the capacity.
 *
 * NOT EVERY SITE IS NAMED AT EVERY ALTITUDE, and the third field goes away once
 * a filière is the subject. Both are answers to the same measurement, taken on
 * a capture at 991 km under `Hydraulique › Tous`: 51 labels offered and 51
 * accepted, 28 of them reading `retenue de lac`, and the smaller marks buried
 * under the text naming their neighbours. A label now has an altitude ceiling
 * set by the site's rank inside the FILTERED cohort — see the block above
 * {@link PLANT_LABEL_ALTITUDE_TIERS} — and drops the phrase the lit chip is
 * already saying — see {@link plantLabelText}.
 *
 * THE MARK CARRIES ITS FILIÈRE IN COLOUR, and in SHAPE where the shape fits — a
 * tinted plate with a cooling tower, a water drop or a flame punched out of it
 * (`plantFiliereIcons.js`; a plate rather than a bare silhouette because half
 * this fleet draws under 18 px, where ink over an orthophoto disappears, and a
 * WHOLE plate under 20 px, where the punch stops being a shape and becomes a
 * stain — 53 of 79 sites, every one of them hydro or thermal). The colour alone
 * was doing all the work for the majority of the fleet: the label that names a
 * site in words is cohort-limited to 60 of 79, drops on collision, and now also
 * yields to altitude, so on a full view of France most of these stations are a
 * coloured dot and a key on the far side of the screen. The key still decodes
 * the colour, and its swatch is MASKED by the same raster the globe draws — at
 * 32 px, above the punch floor — so the pastille in the panel is the mark as
 * the biggest sites draw it.
 *
 * THE MARK IS DRAWN OVER THE TERRAIN, not depth-tested against it. A billboard
 * carries one depth for its whole quad, so a depth-tested mark gets its lower
 * half eaten by the ground in front of it and reads as a parasol rather than as
 * a symbol — see the note on `disableDepthTestDistance` in `repaint`. The price
 * is a per-frame horizon cull, in `onPreRender`.
 *
 * ── The reader can ask for one filière, then for one of its kinds ───────────
 * The row carries a two-level filter: `TOUTES` and the three filières, and —
 * only once a filière is chosen — that filière's own published sub-categories,
 * the paliers under nuclear, the water regimes under hydro, the fuels under
 * thermal. Nothing about it is stored, serialized or refetched: see the
 * comment block above {@link plantFilterChips} for why the second level waits,
 * why both levels are radio rather than multi-select, and why a filter has no
 * business in a share link.
 *
 * AND IT SAYS WHAT IT IS IN FRENCH A READER CAN ACT ON. The three files
 * publish codes — `REP 900`, `Eclusée`, `tranche`, `réserve secondaire` — and
 * this layer renders them through {@link PLANT_KIND_PLAIN} rather than at a
 * reader. The publisher's own figures are untouched; only its vocabulary is
 * translated, and the raw string is still one argument away
 * (`plantKindText(site, { register: 'raw' })`).
 *
 * ── Honesty rules this layer is built around ────────────────────────────────
 *
 * • **This is EDF's fleet, not France's, and the layer never says otherwise.**
 *   The row legend and `getStats()` name the operator. The hydro file carries
 *   51 of the 400+ installations EDF operates — those above 100 MW, plus those
 *   whose secondary reserve reaches 20 MW — and no CNR or SHEM plant at all;
 *   the thermal file carries no Engie or TotalEnergies CCGT. Only nuclear is
 *   complete for the country, because every French reactor is EDF's.
 *
 * • **Three files, three vintages, so there is no single "as of".** Nuclear is
 *   a vision consolidée au 31/12/2025; hydro and thermal au 31/12/2023. The
 *   layer reports the RANGE and stamps each site with its own file's date
 *   rather than presenting 80 094 MW as a figure that existed at one instant.
 *   The nuclear file's own newest reactor entered service in 2002, so the EPR
 *   commissioned at Flamanville after that vision closed is not in it.
 *
 * • **Nameplate capacity is not output.** A 5 460 MW disc at Gravelines is
 *   what the site can produce, not what it is producing — three of its six
 *   reactors could be down for maintenance while the disc stays the same size.
 *   Every reading of this layer says "installée" / "installed".
 *
 * • **A site is drawn once, however many units it holds.** The nuclear and
 *   thermal files publish one row per unit and every unit of a site repeats
 *   the same coordinate, so drawing rows would stack six markers on Gravelines
 *   and none of them would be wrong. Hydro publishes one row per plant and
 *   says nothing about its turbine count, so hydro sites report NO unit count
 *   rather than "1".
 *
 * • **Corse and the îles du Ponant are outside all three datasets.** The
 *   publisher's declared geographic scope excludes them, so the layer draws
 *   nothing there and says why — the same "absence is not a colour" rule the
 *   Vigilance and Mix élec layers follow, for a different reason.
 *
 * • **Five of these sites are also drawn by the Réseau gaz layer, and both are
 *   right.** That layer draws ODRÉ's register of the 14 centralised gas-fired
 *   stations, whoever operates them; this one draws EDF's own fossil-fired
 *   file, whatever it burns. Measured 2026-08-27, the overlap is exactly the
 *   five EDF gas sites — Martigues (0.09 km apart), Bouchain (0.55), Blénod
 *   (0.12), Montereau (0.60) and Gennevilliers (0.15) — and the two publishers
 *   do not fully agree on their capacity: 585 against 575 MW at Bouchain, 427
 *   against 430 at Blénod, 203 against 210 at Gennevilliers. Nothing is
 *   de-duplicated, because neither set contains the other (ODRÉ carries Engie,
 *   TotalEnergies and Uniper plants this file cannot claim; this file carries
 *   the coal and fioul units a gas register does not) and because quietly
 *   dropping one publisher's figure would hide that they disagree.
 *
 * • **A dam is not a power station.** The bundled Dams layer draws OSM dam
 *   structures. Nothing is de-duplicated between the two, because a barrage
 *   and the usine it feeds are different objects — and the overlap is now
 *   large: re-measured on 2026-09-01 against the rebuilt dam pack (6 189
 *   features, 44 441 vertices), 37 of these 51 hydro plants have a mapped dam
 *   vertex within 3 km and 22 within 1 km. The figure this line used to carry
 *   — "only 3 of 51" — was true against the 704-feature pack that shipped when
 *   this layer landed, and became wrong the day the dams pack was rebuilt.
 *   Proximity is not identity: a plant sitting 300 m from a barrage is the
 *   usine that barrage feeds, drawn as the separate object it is.

// rejected before it was written: it puts "MARÉMOTRICE" — one site — on the
// same strip as "NUCLÉAIRE" — eighteen — under a row that is four lines tall
// before the reader has asked anything. So the strip carries the FILIÈRES, and
// a filière's own sub-categories appear only once that filière is the one being
// looked at. Nothing is hidden that was ever visible; the second question is
// simply not asked until the first has an answer.
//
// RADIO, NOT MULTI-SELECT, at both levels. The question this control answers is
// "montre-moi le nucléaire", which is one click on a radio and three on a set of
// toggles. Every button also CLEARS on a second click, so there is always a way
// back out that does not require finding the reset — and `TOUTES` stays on the
// strip anyway, lit, so the unfiltered state is legible rather than merely
// implied by four dark buttons.
//
// THE FILTER IS NOT SERIALIZED INTO A SHARE LINK, and that is deliberate:
// `layerState.js` keeps `edf-power-plants` at `enabled-only` for the reason it
// records under `meteo-stations-fr` — an author's filter would hide 77 % of the
// French fleet from a recipient with no way for them to know it had. The
// author's view is not a fact about France. `fr-hydro-plants` makes the same
// choice for its power floor.
