/**
 * @module sitadelFrance
 *
 * Sitadel — the only forward-looking layer on this globe, drawn on the exact
 * parcels the permits were granted for.
 *
 * `sitadelFeed.js` holds the join and every trap in it. This file is the
 * drawing, and it exists to settle three questions the feed deliberately
 * leaves open: WHERE the layer is allowed to ask, WHAT the two channels claim,
 * and HOW the permits it could not place stay visible without being drawn.
 *
 * ── Against the layer it sits beside ────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `dvf-sales` draws completed transactions: what changed hands, for how much,
 * with a latitude and a longitude already in the file. This draws
 * AUTHORISATIONS — what somebody has been given permission to build and has
 * not necessarily built. DVF looks backwards at price, Sitadel forwards at
 * supply, and on the same parcel the two compose. `bdtopo-buildings` is the
 * stock as surveyed and `urbanisme-gpu` is the rule; a permit is the moment
 * between them.
 *
 * Sitadel publishes NO coordinate — 94 columns on the housing file, 33 on the
 * demolitions, and `geoFields: ["REG","DEP"]` on both. Every position here was
 * computed by joining a cadastral reference to `cadastre-fr`'s own upstream,
 * so every card ends by saying so and by publishing the rate at which that
 * computation succeeded.
 *
 * ── ONE regime, and the arithmetic that forbids a second ────────────────────
 *
 * The four Sitadel files hold 3 020 749 permits over 1.30 GB of CSV, and DiDo
 * answers a filtered, column-projected commune query by SCANNING the whole
 * file: measured 2026-09-02, six sequential queries returned in 3.57–5.01 s
 * whatever their size — Nantes (2 049 rows) took 3.98 s and a single-column
 * probe of the same commune took 3.57 s. A national mesh regime would be
 * 34 945 commune queries at ~4 s, which is 39 hours for one pass. There is no
 * honest maillage, so this layer answers ONE COMMUNE at a time and says which.
 *
 * That also fixes the concurrency, and this is the measurement nobody upstream
 * of this file had: **DiDo refuses a fourth simultaneous request.** Six
 * parallel queries on 2026-09-02 returned three HTTP 200 and three HTTP 429
 * within 145 ms, body `max connections reached: 3` — 26 bytes of plain text,
 * with no `content-type`, no `retry-after` and NO `access-control-allow-origin`,
 * so a browser could not even read the refusal. Three at once are all served.
 * The proxy therefore holds a global semaphore of two and this layer never
 * fetches a second commune while one is in flight.
 *
 * ── The gate: 12 000 m, measured against the communes themselves ────────────
 *
 * At {@link SITADEL_MAX_ALTITUDE_M} a nadir camera at Cesium's default 60°
 * vertical FOV (`VIEW_GATE_DEFAULT_FOV_DEG`) sees 2·h·tan 30° = 13.86 km of
 * ground. The communes this layer answers with are 12.13 km wide (Nantes),
 * 13.29 km (Toulouse) and 17.85 km (Paris) — measured from the outer bounds of
 * their own Etalab cadastre, not estimated. Above that height the answer would
 * be one commune inside a view holding twenty, and the empty ground either side
 * would read as "no permits here" when it means "never asked".
 *
 * There is NO coverage rectangle, deliberately. Sitadel covers the DROM and so
 * does the Etalab cadastre: Saint-Denis de La Réunion (97411) answers with
 * 2 849 permits and a 10 449 654-byte parcel file. A metropolitan box would
 * have refused all of it while claiming national coverage, so the question
 * "is there a French commune under the middle of the screen" is put to
 * `geo.api.gouv.fr`, which is the only service entitled to answer it.
 *
 * ── What the two channels claim ─────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The FILL on a parcel is the lifecycle band of the MOST RECENT authorisation
 * that names it — `ETAT_DAU` read through the three real dates. That is the
 * whole point of the layer: `2` Autorisé is a permit about which nothing
 * further has been reported, `5` Chantier ouvert has a DATE_REELLE_DOC, `6`
 * Travaux achevés has a DATE_REELLE_DAACT, and a permis de démolir is its own
 * band because its own `ETAT_PD` says nothing (1 497 of Nantes' 1 587
 * demolitions and 1 582 of Paris' 1 609 sit at Autorisé). A parcel that
 * carries several permits over thirteen years is coloured by the newest and
 * its card counts the rest; measured on Nantes, 2 747 placed permits sit on
 * 3 032 parcels, so the collision is rare and naming it is cheaper than
 * inventing a rule for it.
 *
 * The DOT is one per placed permit, sized by DWELLINGS CREATED —
 * `NB_LGT_TOT_CREES` under `sitadelPointSize`'s square root and its 200-dwelling
 * ceiling. It carries the layer above the street: a Nantes parcel is 800 m²
 * and sub-pixel at 12 000 m, so without the dot the layer would be invisible
 * for the whole top half of its own altitude range. A demolition draws at the
 * minimum and its card says why — the permis de démolir file has 33 columns
 * and not one of them counts a dwelling.
 *
 * The HEIGHT is the same number on a channel the perspective does not eat.
 *
 * ── The dossier stands a column, and the parcel stays flat ─────────────────
 *
 * A dwelling count is an ABSOLUTE quantity, and the doctrine gives an absolute
 * exactly one honest channel: size. On a globe the screen-size channel is
 * already spent on depth, so what is left is extrusion.
 *
 * THE FIRST VERSION EXTRUDED THE PARCEL ITSELF, and that was wrong in a way its
 * own paragraph did not notice: a prism is a VOLUME, volume is base × height,
 * so the ink on screen was the dwelling count MULTIPLIED BY THE SIZE OF THE
 * PLOT — a number the register says nothing about. Measured on the packs this
 * header already quotes, over the parcels actually extruded, the base area ran
 * p50 403 m² / max 40 400 m² in Paris, p50 395 m² / max 153 173 m² in Nantes
 * (388× the median), p50 637 m² / max 24 955 m² in Ustaritz. Two permits for
 * one dwelling each drew marks 388 apart, and the biggest single mark in Nantes
 * was 25 426 754 m³ of opaque colour for one file.
 *
 * The report that ended it came from Ustaritz: dossier 06454721B0037, 45
 * logements over three adjoining parcels, drawn as one 45 m block of 404 000 m³
 * over a village of 8 m houses — « un gros rectangle qui n'a aucun sens ». The
 * register's own `SURFACE_PLANCHER_CREEE` for that file is 3 308 m².
 *
 * AND THE HEIGHT WAS DRAWN ONCE PER PARCEL, so a dossier naming three plots
 * claimed its dwellings three times: ×1.87 in Ustaritz (932 dwellings of prism
 * for 499 authorised), ×1.73 in Nantes, ×1.30 in Paris.
 *
 * So the two claims are separated, which is what they always were. The PARCEL
 * keeps the ground: a classified wash in its lifecycle colour, its own edge,
 * its own card — that is "this plot". The DOSSIER stands a COLUMN of
 * {@link SITADEL_PRISM_BASE_M} metres square on its anchor, one per permit —
 * that is "this many dwellings". Volume is then proportional to the count and
 * to nothing else. `choroplethPrism.js` calls this option (b), NORMALISE THE
 * BASE, and rejects it for départements because there the polygon IS the map;
 * here the polygon is still drawn under the mark, so the objection does not
 * apply and the exactness is free.
 *
 * WHY 1 METRE PER DWELLING, LINEARLY. The dot uses a square root because a disc
 * encodes through its AREA, and doubling a radius quadruples the ink. A
 * column's height is a LENGTH: it reads directly, twice as tall is twice as
 * many, and square-rooting it would make the tallest column claim 14 times a
 * 1-dwelling one instead of 200. The unit is chosen so the column can be read
 * against the city it stands in rather than against itself: a Nantes block is
 * 10–30 m of BD TOPO volume, so a 27-dwelling permit is a 27 m column — the
 * size of the thing it replaces — and the commune's largest, at 553, is clipped
 * at 200 m, which is 56 m above the Tour Bretagne. Anything steeper would put a
 * housing estate through the cloud layer; anything flatter would make 57 % of
 * permits (the ones creating exactly one dwelling) an invisible film.
 *
 * The ceiling is {@link SITADEL_SIZE_CEILING_LGT} — the feed's own measured
 * constant, 99th percentile 190 dwellings over 22 474 permits, largest 659 —
 * so the dot and the column saturate on the same number. Every clipped column
 * is counted on the row and the card still prints the true count (A5).
 *
 * WHY THE DOT KEEPS ITS SIZE ANYWAY. Two channels for one datum is redundancy,
 * and redundancy is only defensible when the two are legible at different
 * distances — which here is arithmetic, not taste. At the 12 000 m gate a 60°
 * FOV over a 720 px canvas covers 13 856 m of ground: 19.2 m per pixel, so a
 * 200 m column is 10 px of screen height and the median 1-dwelling column is
 * 0.05 px. At 300 m the same canvas covers 346 m: 0.48 m per pixel, the
 * 1-dwelling column is 2 px tall and 25 px wide, and the 800 m² parcel it
 * stands on is ~58 px across. The dot is the layer at the top of the range, the
 * column is the layer at the bottom, and neither is doing the other's job.
 *
 * ── A permit with no height, and why it is not drawn at zero ────────────────
 *
 * Height means dwellings authorised. A plot with no height is a plot whose file
 * publishes no dwelling count — ONE meaning, and there are exactly two ways to
 * arrive at it:
 *
 * • a **permis de démolir**, whose file has 33 columns and no dwelling among
 *   them (this is structural, not missing data);
 * • a **housing permit at zero**. `sitadelFeed.js` reads
 *   `finiteOrNull(NB_LGT_TOT_CREES) ?? 0`, so a published zero and a blank cell
 *   arrive here as the same number and this layer cannot separate them. Over
 *   the 17 housing rows shipped as fixtures, 1 publishes an explicit `0` and
 *   none is blank; the row says "aucun logement créé ou non publié" rather than
 *   choosing one of the two.
 *
 * Neither gets a column of height 0, which would be an invisible claim. They
 * keep the ground fill and the parcel outline they have always had — a
 * ground-classified surface at {@link SITADEL_FILL_ALPHA}, which is a drawn,
 * clickable, coloured object and not an absence — and their PARCEL EDGE is
 * stroked in their own band colour instead of the neutral `#0b1220`. "Outlined
 * in its own colour" therefore reads as "this plot has no height, and the fill
 * tells you which kind": red is a demolition, the four pipeline colours are a
 * housing permit that creates nothing.
 *
 * A fixed-height ghost volume was the other candidate and was rejected: any
 * constant height is a number on the very scale the file did not publish, which
 * is A1 in three dimensions — the same mistake the representation audit (#78) refuses to
 * make with the GPU's non-existent constructible envelope.
 *
 * Measured on the Nantes pack shipped as fixtures — 9 placed permits over 14
 * parcels — 6 dossiers stand a column, 2 are demolitions and 1 is a
 * déclaration préalable creating zero dwellings. Tallest column 27 m, nothing
 * clipped. The wash is still drawn under all 14 plots, and the row prints both
 * totals: the parcels washed, and the dossiers that carry a height.
 *
 * ── A column needs a floor, and a cold floor is not a floor ─────────────────
 *
 * A `GroundPrimitive` is clamped by the renderer; an extruded polygon is not —
 * it is placed at absolute ellipsoidal heights and it has to be told where the
 * ground is. That comes from `sitadelFloorM`, read at the DOSSIER's own anchor,
 * which is also where its dot stands — one permit, one floor, two marks that
 * cannot disagree. (It used to be read per parcel, because the volume was the
 * parcel; a permit naming three plots across a slope had three floors and could
 * sink two of them. One column removes the question.) When no source can answer
 * the dossier stands NO column rather than one extruded from the ellipsoid,
 * which in metropolitan France is 44–55 m underground and would draw a
 * 27-dwelling permit as a hole. One retry three seconds later, once per
 * commune, in the shape `bdtopoBuildings.js` already uses for the same problem.
 *
 * THE DOTS NEEDED THE SAME DISCIPLINE AND DID NOT HAVE IT (2026-09-14). The
 * paragraph above used to say the dots "already stand on" that grid. They did
 * not: they took `0` for a cold cell — the ellipsoid — and, unlike a column,
 * nothing ever moved them afterwards. Measured over Paris, all 4 753 of them
 * sat at ellipsoidal height 1.0 m for a whole session while the drawn mesh
 * under them read 76.7–96.9 m, and because they paint through depth they slid
 * across the rooftops with every camera move. `sitadelFloorM` is the floor all
 * four marks now read — dot, column, card, DETECT callout — and `reanchorPoints`
 * is the pass that moves a dot already on screen once its floor lands.
 *
 * ── What changes under the photorealistic stack ─────────────────────────────
 *
 * The flat parcels stay ground-classified, so on Google 3D they classify as
 * `CESIUM_3D_TILE` and the wash climbs the façades — the drape defect
 * `surfaceFillNotice.js` describes, which is why `getRowControls` declares
 * `surfaceFill` whenever any parcel is still flat.
 *
 * The COLUMNS do not have that defect at all, and this is the part worth
 * stating plainly: an extruded polygon is not a classification volume, it
 * carries no `classificationType`, and it is not draped on anything. It is
 * opaque geometry in the world, depth-tested against the photoreal mesh — so a
 * 12 m column behind a 30 m tileset building is HIDDEN by it instead of painted
 * on it (CARTOGRAPHY F1(a), F4). The colour a reader decodes off a column is
 * the colour that was declared, on every stack. Going 3D removes the constraint
 * rather than adding one; the batched-`GroundPrimitive`-colours-by-bounding-
 * rectangle trap does not exist here either, because per-instance colour on a
 * plain `Primitive` addresses the polygon itself.
 *
 * Opaque, and not translucent, for the reason `bdtopoBuildings.js` measured:
 * an alpha below 1 moves geometry into Cesium's translucent pass, which does
 * not write depth, and a street of see-through boxes reads as one mass with
 * everything showing through everything.
 *
 * The commune OUTLINE is not decoration. It is the scope of the answer, and
 * without it the neighbouring commune reads as "nothing was authorised here"
 * rather than "this was never asked". It is drawn from `geo.api.gouv.fr`'s own
 * `contour`, decimated by `projectGeometry` — Nantes 804 vertices to 269, Paris
 * 532 to 267, Toulouse 1 191 to 398 — which moves the drawn boundary by a mean
 * of 3.6–8.8 m and at worst 183 m (Nantes), 125 m (Paris), 242 m (Toulouse).
 * The row says the outline is simplified. It is never used to decide anything:
 * the commune under the camera is resolved upstream, by the geocoder.
 *
 * ── What is NOT drawn, and where it goes instead ────────────────────────────
 *
 * Measured 2026-09-02 over six communes, both files, against the Etalab
 * cadastre edition 2026-06-01:
 *
 *   Paris      75056   5 204 permits   4 753 placed  91.3%     0 ambiguous
 *   Nantes     44109   3 636           2 747         75.6%     0
 *   Ustaritz   64547     432             238         55.1%     0
 *   Beaupréau  49023     888             484         54.5%   294
 *   Marseille  13055   5 424           1 092         20.1%  4 007
 *   Toulouse   31555   5 687             430          7.6%  5 148
 *   ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *   total             21 271           9 744         45.8%
 *
 * 45.8% is almost exactly the 44.8% DREAL Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes reached on the
 * same data with more time (362 038 permits, 162 171 with a geometry), which is
 * the correct calibration for anyone reading these numbers as a failure.
 *
 * The 11 527 that are not drawn are COUNTED on the row, in `getStats()` and on
 * every card, and they are not in the LEGEND — the panel's swatch IS the datum,
 * and there is no colour for a permit that is nowhere. Nothing is moved to a
 * commune centroid. The three failures are kept apart because a reader can act
 * on the difference: *ambiguous* means the commune publishes section préfixes
 * that Sitadel has no column for and NOTHING will fix it, *missing* means the
 * parcel was divided and renumbered — which is what happens when somebody
 * builds on it — and *noref* means the file is blank.
 *
 * ── The audit agrees with the diagnosis ─────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `SUPERFICIE_TERRAIN` is the plot the applicant declared. It places nothing;
 * it audits. Over the same six communes the share of placed permits whose drawn
 * parcels agree with the declared terrain within a factor of two ranks the
 * communes in the SAME order as the placement rate: Paris 98.4% (4 556/4 630),
 * Nantes 94.2% (2 387/2 533), Beaupréau 86.4%, Ustaritz 84.7%, Marseille 68.6%,
 * Toulouse 51.5% (212/412). An independent measurement agreeing with the join
 * rate is the strongest evidence available that the parcels drawn under the
 * top of that table are the right ones — and the clearest possible warning
 * about the bottom of it. Every card prints its own permit's ratio and the
 * word CONCORDANT or DISCORDANT.
 *
 * ── Two of Sitadel's four files are not read ────────────────────────────────
 *
 * This layer reads the housing register (1 917 260 permits) and the demolitions
 * (202 895) — 2 120 155 of the 3 020 749, or 70.2%. The 792 588 non-residential
 * permits and the 108 006 permis d'aménager are not read, and that is a real
 * hole: Nantes alone has 1 881 non-residential permits and 129 permis
 * d'aménager on top of the 3 636 drawn here, measured through the same URLs.
 * They are omitted because the non-residential file answers a different
 * question — surfaces by destination across seven families, with no dwelling
 * count to size a dot by — and because a third and fourth concurrent DiDo query
 * is exactly the request DiDo answers with 429. The row says two files.

 * was the dwelling count MULTIPLIED BY THE SIZE OF THE PLOT, which the register

 *   base area, m²          p10    p50     p90      max        max ÷ p50

 * So two permits creating one dwelling each drew volumes 388 apart in the same

 * Ustaritz: dossier 06454721B0037, 45 logements over three adjoining parcels
 * (8 984 m²), drawn as one 45 m block of 404 000 m³ standing over a village
 * whose houses are 8 m tall, hiding the street it was filed on. The register's

 * building it describes.
 *
 * `choroplethPrism.js` had already named the disease and the cure — « same

 * as a default for départements because the polygon IS the map there. Here it
