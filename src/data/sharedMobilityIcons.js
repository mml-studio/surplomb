/**
 * @module sharedMobilityIcons
 *
 * The mark a shared vehicle wears on the globe: a PLATE that carries its
 * operator, with its form factor punched through.
 *
 * SINCE 2026-09-21 THE MAP DRAWS A PIN, NOT THE PLATE. Every vehicle is a dot
 * in its operator's hue and a few of them wear {@link sharedMobilityPinGlyph}
 * (`sharedMobilityPins.js` chooses which). The pin punches the same artwork
 * as the plate, so everything below about the silhouettes still holds; the
 * plate and its monogram badge are no longer on the map.
 *
 * A GBFS feed states the physical object in `vehicle_types.json` (`form_factor`
 * + `propulsion_type`), and `gbfsFeeds.vehicleKindFromType()` folds that pair
 * to one of six kinds. Separately, the PAN catalog says who publishes it. Those
 * are independent facts and they get independent channels — see
 * `mobilityOperators.js`, which owns the colour half.
 *
 * ── WHY A PLATE, AND NOT A BARE SILHOUETTE ──────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Until 2026-09-14 this module drew Material Symbols' vehicle glyphs as bare
 * white silhouettes and let `billboard.color` tint them. It was replaced on a
 * measurement, not a preference.
 *
 * The layer draws at 17 CSS px on a `scaleByDistance` ramp of 0.4–1.15, so the
 * real band is 7 to 20 px. Rasterised at those sizes and counted, Material's
 * `pedal_bike` puts **86 px² of operator colour out of 88 into ONE contiguous
 * patch at 17 px**: its own counters close and the bicycle collapses into a
 * blob. Every kind does the same thing at a slightly different size. That is
 * why four operators in one Paris street read as "the same shape in another
 * colour" — the shape channel was already gone, and only the colour was left to
 * carry a distinction the eye then had to make between four saturated hues
 * scattered across thin, broken strokes.
 *
 * The plate fixes the half that was actually broken. The colour becomes one
 * deliberate disc with a hard dark ring instead of an accidental blob with a
 * ragged edge, and the silhouette — now punched OUT of that disc rather than
 * drawn in the operator's hue — gets its contrast from the plate instead of
 * from whatever terrain happens to be underneath.
 *
 * This deliberately contradicts the rule `militarySiteIcons.js` records, that a
 * PLACE wears a plate and a MOVING OBJECT does not. A shared vehicle is not a
 * moving object: GBFS publishes a vehicle only while it is PARKED and
 * available, and never during a rental. Every dot in this layer is somewhere
 * you walk to, which is what the plate says.
 *
 * ── TINT-SAFE BY CONSTRUCTION ───────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Cesium multiplies `billboard.color` into the texture, so the plate is drawn
 * WHITE and every ring is drawn BLACK: white × c = c, and 0 × c = 0. One sprite
 * per kind then serves all 84 operators, the layer keeps spending
 * `billboard.color` on the operator, and the cyan selection tint keeps working
 * without a second set of images. A hue baked into the artwork would fight the
 * multiply and destroy both channels — the failure `cctv.js` records.
 *
 * ── THE MONOGRAM, AND WHY IT IS NOT A LOGO ──────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Colour alone cannot close the "who" channel: 84 operators resolve across the
 * French catalogue against a 17-slot palette, so hues collide by construction.
 * The second half is the operator's INITIAL, punched into a badge on the plate
 * (`interCapitals.js`).
 *
 * Operator logos were the obvious alternative and were measured on 2026-09-14
 * rather than assumed. Three findings, each independently fatal:
 *
 * • **There is no feed to read them from.** GBFS v2.3 defines
 *   `system_information.brand_assets.brand_image_url`. Of 158 French systems
 *   probed from `config/gbfs_fr_systems.json`, 146 answered and **zero**
 *   publish it. (0 of 154 on 2026-09-01, so this is stable, not a bad day.)
 *
 * • **Scraping them produces the WRONG mark, silently.** Of ten major
 *   operators' own sites, Lime, Voi and Vélib' answer 403 to a plain fetch —
 *   and `cityscoot.eu`, whose operator went bankrupt in 2024 while staying in
 *   the catalogue, now serves the favicons of an unrelated squatted site. A
 *   pipeline would have put that logo on the map without raising anything.
 *
 * • **A wordmark does not survive map size.** Rendered at true scale, the marks
 *   split in two: the ones that are ALREADY a single bold letterform (Pony's P,
 *   Vélo'v's V) read from 12 px, while dott, BIRD, Voi and Lime are an
 *   illegible smudge below ~24 px. The letter is what worked, so the letter is
 *   what ships — and it carries no trademark, which the 85 distinct operator
 *   identities in the catalogue would each have required separately.
