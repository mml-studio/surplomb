/**
 * Événements routiers (FR) — what the road operators themselves have declared.
 *
 * Every Direction interdépartementale des routes publishes its live event log
 * to Tipi, and Bison Futé republishes the national aggregate as one keyless
 * DATEX II document under Licence Ouverte 2.0. This layer draws it: the
 * accidents, the rockfalls, the closures, the roadworks ordered for a Tuesday
 * in October, and the diversions posted around them.
 *
 * WHAT THIS IS NOT. It is not a congestion map — the `Trafic routier` layer
 * already colours flow, and `Capteurs trafic` measures it. This is the
 * *declared* state of the network: things a human operator typed into a
 * système d'information routière because they happened. On the 2026-08-31
 * snapshot that was 286 situations, of which nine were accidents and 184 were
 * roadworks, which is the honest shape of a road network on an ordinary evening.
 *
 * ── What the drawing is careful about ───────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * • **One situation, one marker.** DATEX II nests up to twelve records inside
 *   one situation: the accident, the two lanes it blocked, the four exits now
 *   closed. Drawing all of them would put one crash on the map twelve times, so
 *   the CAUSE is drawn and the consequences are counted on its card. The rule
 *   and its ordering live in `bisonFuteFeed.js`, under test.
 *
 * • **A segment is the ROAD where the record says enough to find it, and a
 *   chord where it does not.** A `Linear` location publishes its two endpoints
 *   as coordinates — the shape between them is not in this feed — but it ALSO
 *   publishes a point-repère address pair on a named route, which is a real
 *   linear reference. The proxy resolves that pair against the State's own
 *   survey of the carriageway (`config/rrn_centreline.json`, built by
 *   `scripts/build-rrn-centreline-pack.mjs`) and hands the layer the tarmac.
 *   Measured on the 2026-09-01 feed: 168 of 210 segments (80 %) are drawn on
 *   the road, and the traced line runs a median 1.02× its own chord.
 *
 *   The rest keep the chord, and the card keeps saying so. That is the honest
 *   split — the N126 roadworks near Castres were 37 km of straight line across
 *   open country for 40 km of road, which is what this fixes; a rockfall whose
 *   PR addresses disagree with its coordinates is still drawn as the line
 *   between two published points, because guessing would be worse.
 *
 * • **Planned is not happening.** 68 of the 286 situations had not started yet
 *   — roadworks ordered weeks ahead. They are drawn dimmer, sized smaller, and
 *   the default scope hides them, because a globe that paints October's
 *   roadworks over tonight's traffic is telling you something false about now.
 *
 * • **Ended means ended.** An operator can close an event with a lifecycle flag
 *   while its validity window stays open — a rockfall opened on 31 January and
 *   cleared in March would otherwise sit on the N20 forever. The flag wins.
 *
 * • **The RRN non concédé only.** The conceded motorways — the whole
 *   ASF/APRR/Sanef network — are NOT in this feed. Their absence is a property
 *   of the source (Bison Futé serves them under the credentialed *Action b*
 *   licence), not a gap this layer can fill, and the row says so.
