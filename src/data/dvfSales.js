/**
 * DVF — what the flats around this point actually sold for, on the buildings
 * they sold in.
 *
 * The register is the file a French buyer opens by hand, one commune at a time.
 * Drawn in place it answers the question that survey does not: not "what is the
 * average in the 13th" but "what did the three buildings I can see change hands
 * for, and when".
 *
 * ── WHY SO MANY DOTS ARE NEUTRAL ───────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A price per square metre is a comparable only when the sale bought exactly
 * one dwelling. `dvfFeed.js` carries the measurement: one captured mutation is
 * a €32,000,000 building spread over 179 rows, and the obvious arithmetic turns
 * it into €1.28 million per square metre. Those sales are still drawn — they
 * happened — but in the neutral slate, with no ratio. A colour would be a claim
 * the register does not support.
 *
 * That neutral moved from `#7c8aa0` to `#9aa7bd` on 2026-09-03, and the reason
 * is measured, not aesthetic. Since these sales now also paint BUILDING VOLUMES
 * (below), the neutral has to stay distinguishable from `buildingTheme.js`'s
 * "nobody measured this one" wash. Against the six BD TOPO usage colours washed
 * and then darkened across the layer's whole height range, `#7c8aa0` sat at
 * ΔE76 **25.0** — exactly on `BUILDING_THEME_MIN_DELTA_E`, one rounding away
 * from reading as "no data". `#9aa7bd` measures **35.6** against the same set,
 * while staying at least **45.7** from every price class of the ramp. Two
 * different admissions, two colours nobody has to squint at.
 *
 * ── THE DENOMINATOR, AND WHY IT IS NOT THE VIEWPORT ANY MORE (C1) ──────────
 *
 * Until 2026-09-03 each sale was coloured against the median of the sales
 * inside the scan radius — the median of whatever the camera was pointing at.
 * `docs/CARTOGRAPHY.md` C1 forbids exactly that, and the fixture shows why it
 * is not a theoretical objection: inside ONE arrondissement the local median is
 * 8 857 €/m² from avenue de France and 12 406 €/m² from rue de Tolbiac 1.5 km
 * away, a 40 % swing with no row of data changed. Worse, both the cheapest
 * (6 797 €/m²) and the dearest (12 406 €/m²) sale of the captured sample came
 * out at *exactly* 1.00 × the local median when the camera sat on them — the
 * two extremes of the arrondissement, both painted "average yellow", because
 * the median of one sale is that sale.
 *
 * The ratio itself was never the problem: an absolute €/m² ramp paints all of
 * Paris one colour and stops answering "is this dear FOR HERE". So the fraction
 * stays and the denominator becomes stable and NAMED — the median of the
 * COMMUNE (the arrondissement, where one exists, because that is how DVF itself
 * publishes) over the editions in hand, computed by `dvfFeed.communeReference`
 * from the very rows the proxy already parsed. Against it the same six sales
 * spread across four classes: 6 797 → 0,76 (green), 7 182 → 0,80 (green),
 * 8 857 → 0,99 and 9 054 → 1,01 (yellow), 10 464 → 1,17 (amber), 12 406 → 1,39
 * (red). The extremes stop being average.
 *
 * The denominator is printed in the legend and on every card, because a ratio
 * whose denominator is not written down is not a measurement. It changes when
 * the reader crosses into another commune — which is a change of REFERENCE
 * TERRITORY, announced in the legend, not a phantom of the framing: widening
 * the view, zooming, or sharing the link never moves it. That is the C1
 * conformity test in the doctrine, and `dvfSales.test.mjs` runs it.
 *
 * The class breaks themselves are frozen ratios ({@link DVF_RATIO_BREAKS},
 * ±5 % and ±25 %), never quantiles of the sample, and the legend restates them
 * in €/m² at the current reference so a reader gets the bounds in the unit of
 * the phenomenon as well as in ratio.
 *
 * WHEN THERE IS NO DENOMINATOR. `basis: 'none'` is answered, never a silent
 * substitution — and it is provably unreachable while there is anything to
 * colour: the served sales are a subset of the mutations the reference is
 * computed from, so "no comparable in the commune" implies "no comparable on
 * screen". A sale that somehow arrived with a ratio and no basis is painted
 * `#c46be0` (ΔE76 63.1 from the nearest price class, 66.3 from the wash) and
 * gets its own legend row, because A1 does not admit an unmarked fallback even
 * for a state the test says cannot happen.
 *
 * ── THE VOLUMES (track 1 of the representation audit, #78) ─────────────────
 *
 * The layer registers a building theme (`buildingTheme.js`, precedence 20) so
 * that when Bâti 3D is on, the BD TOPO volumes carry this same ratio and the
 * street becomes the price map instead of a field of pins above the roofs.
 *
 * • **`reduce` takes the MOST RECENT mutation of the building, not a median of
 *   them.** Several sales on one volume is the normal case, and they are not
 *   contemporaries: the editions in hand span up to five years, so a median
 *   would publish a price that was never asked, at a date that does not exist.
 *   "Worst of the block" — the right answer for a DPE label — has no meaning
 *   here either: there is no bad price, only a high one. What a buyer is handed
 *   as a comparable is the last transaction, so that is what the volume shows.
 *   Ties are broken by the larger dwelling surface, then by mutation id, so the
 *   answer never depends on the order the proxy happened to concatenate its
 *   editions in.
 *
 * • **The most recent mutation wins even when it has no €/m².** Falling back to
 *   the most recent *comparable* one would paint a 2021 price onto a building
 *   that changed hands in 2024 for an undisclosed split — presenting a stale
 *   number as current, which is the worse lie. Instead the volume takes the
 *   neutral slate and its own legend row: "the last thing that happened here
 *   cannot be priced" is information, and it is *not* the same statement as
 *   "nothing happened here", which is the wash.
 *
 * • **The marker stays, at full size.** It is the click surface and the card,
 *   it is the only thing on screen when Bâti 3D is off, and it is drawn for
 *   sales the join cannot place on any volume. It is NOT shrunk when the theme
 *   paints, for two reasons: the layer would have to import the BD TOPO module
 *   to know whether volumes are actually loaded — the one-way coupling the
 *   theme registry exists to avoid — and marker size already carries "has a
 *   comparable €/m²" (19 px) versus "does not" (15 px). Making it also carry
 *   another layer's on/off state is A3, twice over.
 *
 * • **An unpainted volume is not a building nobody bought.** The scan asks the
 *   register about a 300 m disc; BD TOPO loads volumes over a box up to 9 km
 *   wide. Most unpainted volumes were therefore never asked about, so the
 *   theme's `unknownLabel` says "hors du rayon de 300 m ou sans mutation" and
 *   never "sans mutation". Publishing the layer's own reach as a fact about the
 *   market is A1 at the scale of a district.
 *
 * • **This layer does not count the volumes it paints.** The painted /
 *   unpainted tally belongs to whoever owns the geometry, and `bdtopo` prints
 *   it on its own row from the join it actually performed. Re-running the join
 *   here to publish a second number would be 2–9 ms of duplicated work for a
 *   figure that would be WRONG whenever Bâti 3D is off or the photoreal stack
 *   is up: this layer would claim 42 painted volumes with none on screen.
 *   What it publishes is what it knows — how many sales it handed over, how
 *   many of those can carry a colour, and what they are divided by.

/**
 * WHICH SALES ARE DRAWN — the filter the reader kept thinking was already
 * there.
 *
 * Reported 2026-09-14, from rue des Basques in Bayonne: « j'ai l'impression
 * qu'on peut choisir soit de voir les appartements, soit de voir les maisons
 * […] beaucoup de ventes de maisons apparaissent, il n'y a que du collectif
 * ici ». Both halves of that were wrong and the interface was why. The chips
 * on the row said `Appart.` and `Maison`, and they belonged to the ESTIMATE
 * next door — they chose the subject a value was computed for and never
 * touched a single dot on the map. So the reader, with `Maison` lit, was
 * looking at 257 flats and reading them as houses. The register's own count
 * within 300 m of that point, over five editions: zero houses.
 *
 * Two ways to fix that. Label the chips harder, or make them true. This is
 * the second, and `docs/CARTOGRAPHY.md` G1 is the reason it is not a
 * judgement call — « le filtre est le maillon manquant », named as the most
 * valuable missing component of the whole application. A reader who
 * spontaneously reaches for a control that is not there has said which
 * control to build.
 *
 * THREE VALUES AND NOT FOUR. `autre` — a commercial local, a cellar or a
 * parking space alone, bare land — is not offered as a class of its own
 * because nobody opens a price layer to look for a parking space; it is
 * included in `tous`, counted in the disclosure line when a filter hides it,
 * and named on its own card. `dvfFeed.saleKind` holds the fold and the
 * measurement behind it.
 *
 * IT IS A DRAW-ONLY PARAMETER. The register served every mutation in the
 * radius; filtering is a subset of rows already in memory, so the chip never
 * costs a request (`drawOnlyParams`, `addressScanLayer.js`). And the COLOURS
 * do not move when it changes: the denominator is the commune median over
 * every mutation of the editions, which is what C1 requires and what makes
 * "the flats here are dearer than this commune" a sentence that survives the
 * filter being on.
 *
 * THE VALUES ARE THE ESTIMATE'S OWN WORDS, and that is load-bearing rather
 * than tidy. `avis-valeur` sits on this same fused row and has always taken
 * `type: 'Appartement' | 'Maison'`; sharing the vocabulary is what lets one
 * chip steer both members through the manager's fan-out, so pressing
 * « Maisons » shows the houses AND estimates a house. One control, one reader
 * intention, two layers — instead of the two identical-looking strips of chips
 * that caused the confusion in the first place.

/**
 * The key to the ramp (D1) — the CLASSES, and nothing that is not one.
 *
 * ── WHY THIS IS SHORTER THAN IT WAS, AND WHAT DID NOT LEAVE ────────────────
 *
 * Measured on Bayonne, 2026-09-14: ten entries, each with a paragraph under
 * it, filling the whole right rail and running off the bottom of the screen
 * before the Avis de valeur block underneath had shown its first line. Every
 * sentence in it was true and most of them were the wrong sentence to put in
 * front of somebody who had just switched the layer on. D1's test is « sans
 * ouvrir aucun panneau, l'utilisateur peut-il traduire une couleur en
 * valeur ? » — and a key you have to READ for a minute fails it as surely as
 * one that is hidden.
 *
 * So the key now holds exactly the six things that are painted, and the three
 * that were never classes moved to the two slots that exist for them:
 *
 *   · the DENOMINATOR and the frozen rule → {@link dvfLegendNote}, the block's
 *     own line, printed ABOVE the classes it divides;
 *   · the radius, the clipping and the mutations with no coordinate →
 *     {@link dvfLegendDisclosure}, the A5 line under the classes;
 *   · each class's sentence → its tooltip, which is where `_refreshMapLegend`
 *     puts a blurb once entries sit side by side.
 *
 * Nothing was deleted. The layer says the same things in a fifth of the
 * height, and the classes are visible without scrolling, which is the whole
 * of what the key is for.
 *
 * ── THE LABELS ARE €/m², NOT RATIOS ────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `+25 % et plus · 5 164 €/m² et plus` was both bounds on one line and it was
 * the longest line in the block. D2 asks for bounds a reader can hold, and of
 * those two only the second can be compared to a listing. The ratio is not
 * lost: the rule that produced it is stated once in the note above, where it
 * belongs — it is a property of the whole ramp, not of one class.
 *
 * `counts` is supplied when the caller knows what was drawn (the layer's own
 * row, counting SALES) and omitted when `buildingTheme.js` will fill it in by
 * matching swatch to painted colour (the Bâti 3D row, counting VOLUMES). Same
 * ramp, two populations, and neither of them invented.
 * @param {object} reference From {@link dvfReference}.
 * @param {?Map<string, number>} counts class id → count, or null.
 * @param {{neutral?: ?{label: string, blurb: string}}} [options] The neutral
 *   row's words when the shapes on screen state it differently — a section is
 *   neutral for having too few priced sales, not for having none.
 * @returns {Array<object>}

/**
 * Above 600 m this layer stops drawing one mark per sale and paints the
 * CADASTRE: from 600 m to 1 800 m every plot a sale in the box names, painted
 * by its most recent sale; above that, every cadastral section, painted by the
 * median of its sales. `scanRegime.js` owns the altitudes, and
 * `dvfFeed.aggregateSalesIntoPlots` the measurements that put them there.
 *
 * WHY NOT DISCS ANY MORE. Until 2026-09-21 both bands were grids of discs,
 * 150 m and 850 m wide, sized by their count. The operator's verdict on
 * screen: « je n'aime pas trop ces cercles d'affichage par zone, j'aurais
 * préféré qu'on vienne directement dessiner les parcelles ». A disc fell
 * across two blocks and a boulevard and named no ground a reader could see;
 * a plot is the ground the register says changed hands, and a section is the
 * cadastre's own subdivision of a commune.
 *
 * THE COLOUR LANGUAGE DOES NOT CHANGE. Plots and sections are painted from
 * {@link DVF_RATIO_CLASSES} — the same five frozen bands, each sale divided by
 * the median of ITS OWN commune — so a reader who learned the ramp at street
 * level reads the same ramp from altitude. A plot even keeps the very colour
 * it wears under its markers below 600 m: it is painted from the same sale,
 * picked by the same function (`dvfFeed.mostRecentMutation`).
 *
 * PRIMITIVES, NOT ENTITIES, and that is the performance half of the decision.
 * The densest box measured holds 1 698 plots; as entities that is ~3 500
 * objects — a fill and an outline each — at the ~30 KiB of `Entity` machinery
 * `localGeojson.js` measured per feature. Drawn the way `cadastreParcels.js`
 * draws its 5 000 parcels instead, it is ONE classification `GroundPrimitive`
 * per colour (six at most) and one `GroundPolylinePrimitive` for every edge.
 * One colour per batch is not a style choice: a batch mixing colours repaints
 * its neighbours along their bounding rectangles (`cadastreParcels.js`,
 * `drawRecords`).
 *
 * A CLICK IS ANSWERED BY GEOMETRY, not by the pick. Ground classification
 * answers `scene.pick` with whichever shadow volume the ray enters first,
 * which at this globe's oblique angles is often not the shape under the
 * pointer; the shapes are in memory, so the shell's `groundCard` finds the
 * one under the ground point directly (`ringGeometry.pointInPolygons`).
 */

/**
 * Ink. Heavier than the 0.2 wash under the markers below 600 m, because up
 * here the plot IS the mark — there is no euro sign above it to carry the

 * a building: the same alpha would put ten times the ink on screen for the

 * surface of the tileset inside the plot, walls and roof alike), and ringed in
 * the same colour, thicker.
 *
 * THE RING IS NOT THE SELECTION CYAN, and the first version was. On the
 * photoreal mesh a ground polyline drapes down every wall standing on the
 * boundary, and a plot's boundary is where its façades are: the ring painted
 * the whole street front of 27 rue Port du Temple cyan, a building the colour
 * of no class, beside a key that says cyan means nothing. In the class colour
 * the façade reads as the price it is; the marker keeps the cyan.
 *
 * NOT the wash made thicker for everybody. The 0.2 wash under every marker is
 * a locator; this one is an answer to one question, and it goes when the card
 * does.
 *
 * Primitives rather than entities, and unpickable: an entity in the shell's
 * data source would be indexed as a card of its own (a polyline has a
 * position), and a click on the lit plot has to reach whatever is under it
 * exactly as it did before.
